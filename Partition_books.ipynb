       "\"to have anything to do with this . '' `` What do you mean by 'this ' ? '' There was something in the tone of her query which set me on guard . It was not sincere ; it had not that natural intonation , even , all through , which marks a question put in simple faith . Rather was it in the tone of one who asks , knowing well the answer which will or may be given . As I have said , I did not know much about women , but the tone of coquetry , no matter how sweet , no matter how ingenuous , no matter how lovable , can not be mistaken by any man with red blood in his veins ! Secretly I exulted , for I felt instinctively that there rested some advantage with me in the struggle of sex . The knowledge gave me coolness , and brought my brain to the aid of my heart . Nothing would have delighted me more at the moment than to fling myself , actually as well as metaphorically , at the girl 's feet . My mind was made up to try to win her ; my only thought now was the best means to that end . I felt that I was a little sententious as I replied to her question : '' By 'this ' I mean the whole episode of my meeting with you . '' `` And Mrs. Jack , '' she added , interrupting me . `` And Mrs. Jack , of course , '' I went on , feeling rejoiced that she had given me an opportunity of saying something which I would not otherwise have dared to say . `` Or rather I should perhaps say , my meeting with Mrs. Jack and her friend . It was to me a most delightful thing to meet with Mrs. Jack ; and I can honestly say this day has been the happiest of my life . '' `` Do n't you think we had better be getting on ? Mrs. Jack will be waiting for us ! '' she said , but without any kind of reproach in her manner . `` All right , '' I answered , as I ran up a steep sandhill and held out my hand to help her . I did not let her hand go till we had run down the other side , and up and down another hillock and came out upon the flat waste of sand which lay between us and the road , and over which a sort of ghostly cloud of sand drifted . Before we left the sand , I said earnestly : '' Gormala 's presence seems always to mean gloom and sorrow , weeping and mourning , fear and death . I would not have any of them come near you or yours . This is why I thanked God then , and thank Him now , that in our meeting Gormala had no part ! '' She gave me her hand impulsively . As for an instant her soft palm lay in my palm and her strong fingers clasped mine , I felt that there was a bond between us which might some day enable me to shield her from harm . When Mrs. Jack , and 'her friend ' , were leaving the hotel , I came to the door to see them off . She said to me , in a low voice , as I bade farewell : '' We shall , I daresay , see you before long . I know that Mrs. Jack intends to drive over here again . Thank you for all your kindness . Good night ! '' There was a shake of the reins , a clatter of feet on the hard road , a sweeping round of the rays of light from the lamp as the cart swayed at the start under the leap forward of the high-bred horse and swung up the steep inland roadway . The last thing I saw was a dark , muffled figure , topped by a tam-o'-shanter cap , projected against the mist of moving light from the lamp . Next morning I was somewhat _distrait_ . Half the night I had lain awake thinking ; the other half I had dreamt . Both sleeping and waking dreams were mixed , ranging from all the brightness of hope to the harrowing possibilities of vague , undefined fear . Sleeping dreams have this difference over day dreams , that the possibilities become for the time actualities , and thus for good and ill , pleasure or pain , multiply the joys or sufferings . Through all , however , there remained one fixed hope always verging toward belief , I should see Miss Anita -- Marjory -- again . Late in the afternoon I got a letter directed in a strange hand , fine and firm , with marked characteristics and well formed letters , and just enough of unevenness to set me at ease . I am never quite happy with the writer whose hand is exact , letter by letter , and word by word , and line by line . So much can be told by handwriting , I thought , as I looked at the letter lying beside my plate . A hand that has no characteristics is that of a person insipid ; a hand that is too marked and too various is disconcerting and undependable . Here my philosophising came to an end , for I had opened the envelope , and not knowing the writing , had looked at the signature , `` Marjory Anita . '' I hoped that no one at the table d'hote breakfast noticed me , for I felt that I was red and pale by turns . I laid the letter down , taking care that the blank back page was uppermost ; with what nonchalance I could I went on with my smoked haddie . Then I put the letter in my pocket and waited till I was in my own room , secure from interruption , before I read it . That one should kiss a letter before reading it , is conceivable , especially when it is the first which one has received from the girl he loves . It was not dated nor addressed . A swift intuition told me that she had not given the date because she did not wish to give the address ; the absence of both was less marked than the presence of the one alone . It addressed me as `` Dear Mr . Hunter . '' She knew my name , of course , for I had told it to her ; it was on the envelope . The body of the letter said that she was asked by Mrs. Jack to convey her warm thanks for the great service rendered ; to which she ventured to add the expression of her own gratitude . That in the hurry and confusion of mind , consequent on their unexpected position , they had both quite forgotten about the boat which they had hired and which had been lost . That the owner of it would no doubt be uneasy about it , and that they would both be grateful if I would see him -- he lived in one of the cottages close to the harbour of Port Erroll -- and find out from him the value of the boat so that Mrs. Jack might pay it to him , as well as a reasonable sum for the loss of its use until he should have been able to procure another . That Mrs. Jack ventured to give him so much trouble , as Mr. Hunter had been already so kind that she felt emboldened to trespass upon his goodness . And was `` yours faithfully , 'Marjory Anita . ' '' Of course there was a postscript -- it was a woman 's letter ! It ran as follows : `` Have you deciphered those papers ? I have been thinking over them as well as other things , and I am convinced they contain some secret . You must tell me all about them when I see you on Tuesday . M. '' I fear that logic , as understood in books , had little to do with my kiss on reading this ; the reasoning belonged to that higher plane of thought on which rests the happiness of men and women in this world and the next . There was not a thought in the postscript which did not give me joy -- utter and unspeakable joy ; and the more I thought of it and the oftener I read it the more it seemed to satisfy some aching void in my heart , `` Have you deciphered the papers '' -- the papers whose existence was only known to her and me ! It was delightful that we should know so much of a secret in common . She had been 'thinking over them ' -- and other things ! 'Other things ! ' -- I had been thinking of other things ; thinking of them so often that every detail of their being or happening was photographed not only on my memory but seemingly on my very soul . And of all these 'other things ' there was one ! ! ... To see her again ; to hear her voice ; to look in her eyes ; to see her lips move and watch each varying expression which might pass across that lovely face , evoked by thoughts which we should hold in common ; to touch her hand .... I sat for a while like one in a rapturous dream , where one sees all the hopes of the heart fulfilled in completeness and endlessly . And this was all to be on Tuesday next -- Only six days off ! ... I started impulsively and went to the oak chest which stood in the corner of my room and took out the papers . After looking over them carefully I settled quietly down to a minute examination of them . I felt instinctively that my mandate or commission was to see if they contained any secret writing . The letters I placed aside , for the present at any rate . They were transparently simple and written in a flowing hand which made anything like the necessary elaboration impossible . I knew something of secret writing , for such had in my boyhood been a favourite amusement with me . At one time I had been an invalid for a considerable period and had taken from my father's library a book by Bishop Wilkins , the brother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell , called `` Mercury : or the Secret and Swift Messenger . '' Herein were given accounts of many of the old methods of secret communication , ciphers , string writing , hidden meanings , and many of the mechanical devices employed in an age when the correspondence of ambassadors , spies and secret agents was mainly conducted by such means . This experience had set my mind somewhat on secret writing , and ever after when in the course of miscellaneous reading I came across anything relating to the subject I made a note of it . I now looked over the papers to see if I could find traces of any of the methods with which I was acquainted ; before long I had an idea . It was only a rudimentary idea , a surmise , a possibility ; but still it was worth going into . It was not any cause of undue pride to me , for it came as a corollary to an established conclusion , rather than as a fine piece of reasoning from acute observation . The dates of the letters gave the period as the end of the sixteenth century , when one of the best ciphers of that time had been conceived , the `` Biliteral Cipher '' of Francis Bacon . To this my attention had been directed by the work of John Wilkins and I had followed it out with great care . As I was familiar with the principle and method of this cipher I was able to detect signs of its existence ; and this being so , I had at once strong hopes of being able to find the key to it . The Biliteral cipher has as its great advantage , that it can be used in any ordinary writing , and that its forms and methods are simply endless . All that it requires in the first instance is that there be some method arranged on between the writer and the reader of distinguishing between different forms of the same letter . In my desk I had a typewritten copy of a monograph on the subject of the Biliteral cipher , in which I half suggested that possibly Bacon 's idea might be worked out more fully so that a fewer number of symbols than his five would be sufficient . Leaving my present occupation for a moment I went and got it ; for by reading it over I might get some clue to aid me . Some thought which had already come to me , or some conclusion at which I had already arrived might guide me in this new labyrinth of figures , words and symbols . [ 1 ] [ 1 ] See Appendix A . When I had carefully read the paper , occasionally referring to the documents before me , I sat down and wrote a letter to Miss Anita telling her that I had undertaken the task at once on her suggestion and that I surmised that the method of secret writing adopted if any , was probably a variant of the Biliteral cipher . I therefore sent her my own monograph on the subject so that if she chose she might study it and be prepared to go into the matter when we met . I studiously avoided saying anything which might frighten her or make any barrier between us ; matters were shaping themselves too clearly for me to allow myself to fall into the folly of over-precipitation . It was only when I had placed the letter with its enclosure in the envelope and written Marjory 's -- Miss Anita 's -- name that I remembered that I had not got her address . I put it in my pocket to keep for her till we should meet on Tuesday . When I resumed my work I began on the two remaining exhibits . The first was a sheaf of some thirty pages torn out of some black-letter law-book . The only remarkable thing about it was that every page seemed covered with dots -- hundreds , perhaps thousands on each page . The second was quite different : a narrow slip of paper somewhat longer than a half sheet of modern note paper , covered with an endless array of figures in even lines , written small and with exquisite care . The paper was just such a size as might be put as marker in an ordinary quarto ; that it had been so used was manifest by the discolouration of a portion of it that had evidently stuck out at the top of the volume . Fortunately , in its long dusty rest in the bookshelf the side written on had been downward so that the figures , though obscured by dust and faded by light and exposure to the air , were still decipherable . This paper I examined most carefully with a microscope ; but could see in it no signs of secret writing beyond what might be contained in the disposition of the numbers themselves . I got a sheet of foolscap and made an enlarged copy , taking care to leave fair space between the rows of figures and between the figures themselves . Then I placed the copy of figures and the first of the dotted pages side by side before me and began to study them . I confined my attention at first chiefly to the paper of figures , for it struck me that it would of necessity be the simpler of the two systems to read , inasmuch as the symbols should be self-contained . In the dotted letters it was possible that more than one element existed , for the disposition of significants appeared to be of endless variety , and the very novelty of the method -- it being one to which the eyes and the senses were not accustomed -- made it a difficult one to follow at first . I had little doubt , however , that I should ultimately find the dot cipher the more simple of the two , when I should have learned its secret and become accustomed to its form . Its mere bulk made the supposition likely that it was in reality simple ; for it would be indeed an endless task , to work out in this laborious form two whole sheets of a complicated cipher . Over and over and over again I read the script of numbers . Forward and backward ; vertically ; up and down , for the lines both horizontal and vertical were complete and exact , I read it . But nothing struck me of sufficient importance to commence with as a beginning . Of course there were here and there repetitions of the same combination of figures , sometimes two , sometimes three , sometimes four together ; but of the larger combinations the instances were rare and did not afford me any suggestion of a clue ! So I became practical , and spent the remainder of my work-time that day in making by aid of my microscope an exact but enlarged copy , but in Roman letters , of the first of the printed pages . Then I reproduced the dots as exactly as I could . This was a laborious task indeed . When the page was finished , half-blinded , I took my hat and went out along the shore towards Whinnyfold . I wanted to go to the Sand Craigs ; but even to myself I said 'Whinnyfold ' which lay farther on . `` Men are deceivers ever , '' sang Balthazar in the play : they deceive even themselves at times . Or they pretend they do -- which is a new and advanced form of the same deceit . CHAPTER X A CLEAR HORIZON If any ordinary person be afflicted with ennui and want something to take his thoughts away from a perpetual consideration of his own weariness let me recommend him to take up the interpretation of secret writing . At first , perhaps , he may regard the matter lightly and be inclined to smile at its triviality . But after a little while , if he have in him at all any of the persistence or doggedness which is , and should be , a part of a man 's nature , he will find the subject take possession of him to the almost entire exclusion of all else . Turn from it how he will ; make he never so many resolutions to put the matter behind him ; try he never so hard to find some more engrossing topic , he will still find the evasive mystery ever close before him . For my own part I can honestly say that I ate , drank , slept and dreamed secret writing during the entire of the days and nights which intervened between my taking up the task and the coming of Miss Anita to Cruden Bay . All day long the hidden mystery was before me ; wherever I was , in my room , still or contorting myself ; walking on the beach ; or out on the headlands , with the breezes singing in my ears , and the waves lapping below my feet . Hitherto in my life my only experience of haunting had been that of Gormala ; but even that experience failed before the ever-hopeful , ever-baffling subject of the cryptograms . The worst of my feeling , and that which made it more poignant , was that I was of the firm belief not only that there was a cryptogram but that my mind was already on the track of it . Every now and again , sometimes when the MS. or its copy was before me and sometimes when I was out in the open , for the moment not thinking of it at all , a sort of inspiration would come to me ; some sort of root idea whose full significance I felt it difficult to grasp . My first relief came on Tuesday when at noon I saw the high dog-cart dash past the gate and draw up short opposite the post-office . I did not lose any time in reaching the cart so as to be able to help the ladies down . Marjory gave me both her hands and jumped lightly , but the elder lady required a good deal of help . It is always thus ; the experience of every young man is the same . Every woman , old or young , except the one whom he likes to lift or carry tenderly , is willing to be lifted or carried in the most leisurely or self-denying manner . When Mrs. Jack and 'her friend ' had come into the hotel sitting-room the latter said to me : '' I hope you forgive us for all the trouble we have put you to . '' `` No trouble at all , '' I answered -- and oh ! it sounded so tame -- '' only a pleasure ! '' `` Thank you , '' she continued gravely , `` that is very nice of you . Now we want you to add to your kindness and take us out again on that rock . I have not yet finished my sketch , and I do n't like to be baffled . '' `` Finished your sketch , my dear , '' said Mrs. Jack , in a tone which manifestly showed that the whole thing was new to her . `` Why , Marjory , it was washed into the sea before Mr. Hunter came to help us ! '' The slight , quick blush which rose to her face showed that she understood the false position in which the maladroit remark placed her ; but she went on pluckily : '' Oh , yes , dear , I know ! What I mean is , that having set my heart on making that sketch , I want to do it ; even if my first effort went wrong . That is , dear Mrs. Jack , if you do not mind our going out there again . '' `` Oh , my dear , '' said the elder lady , `` of course I will do just whatever you wish . But I suppose it will do if I sit on the rock near at hand ? Somehow , since our experience there , I seem to prefer the mainland than any place where you may have to swim to get away from it . '' Marjory smiled at me as she said to her : '' That will do capitally . And you can keep the lunch basket ; and have your eye on me and the rising of the tide all the time . '' So I sent to Whinnyfold to have a boat ready when we should drive over . Whilst the ladies were preparing themselves for the boating trip I went to my room and took in my pocket the papers from the chest and my rescripts . I took also the letter which I had not been able to deliver . At Whinnyfold Miss Anita and I took the steep zigzag to the beach , piloted by one of John Hay 's boys whilst the other took Mrs. Jack across the neck of the headland to the Sand Craigs . As we went down the steep path , the vision of the procession of ghosts moving steadily up it on Lammas Eve , came back to me ; instinctively I looked round to see if Gormala was watching . I breathed more freely when I saw she was not about . I should dearly have liked to take Miss Anita alone in the boat , but I feared that such was not safe . Rowing amongst the rocks of the Skares is at the best of times no child 's play , and I was guardian of too great a treasure to be willing to run any risks . Young Hay and I pulled , the boy being in the bow and doing the steering . This position of affairs suited me admirably , for it kept me close to my companion and facing her . It was at all times a pleasure to me as it would have been to any man , to watch her face ; but to-day her eager joy at the beauty of all around her made me thrill with delight . The day was ideal for the place ; a bright , clear day with just a ripple of wind from the water which took the edge from the July heat . The sea quivered with points of light , as though it were strewn with diamonds , and the lines of the racing tide threading a way amongst the rocks below were alone an endless source of interest . We rowed slowly which is much the safest way of progression in these waters , and especially when , as now , the tide was running towards the end of the ebb . As the boy seemed to know every one of the myriad rocks which topped the water , and by a sort of instinct even those that lay below , we steered a devious course . I had told him to take us round by the outer rocks from which thousands of seabirds rose screaming as we approached ; and as we crept in under the largest of them we felt that mysterious sense of unworthiness which comes to one in deep water under the shadow of rocks . I could see that Marjory had the sense of doubt , or of possible danger , which made her clutch hard at each gunwale of the boat till her knuckles grew white . As we rounded the Reivie o' Pircappies , and found the tide swirling amongst the pointed rocks , she grew so deadly pale that I felt concerned . I should have liked to question her , but as I knew from my experience of her courage that she would probably prefer that I remained silent , I pretended not to notice . Male pretence does not count for much with women . She saw through me at once , and with a faint smile , which lit the pallor of her face like sunshine on snow , she said in so low a whisper that it did not reach the fisher boy : '' I was thinking what it would have been for us that day -- only for you . '' `` I was glad , '' I answered in an equally low voice , `` to be able to render any help to -- to Mrs. Jack and her friend . '' `` Mrs. Jack -- and her friend -- are very much obliged to you , '' she answered gaily in her natural voice and tone . I could see that she had fully regained her courage , as involuntarily she took her hands from the sides of the boat . We kept now well out from the rocks and in deep water , and shortly sighted the Sand Craigs . As we could see Mrs. Jack and her escort trudging leisurely along the sand , and as we did not wish to hurry her , I asked young Hay with my companion 's consent , to keep round the outermost of the Sand Craigs , which was now grey-white with sea-gulls . On our approach the birds all rose and wheeled round with myriad screaming ; the wonder and admiration of the girl 's eyes as they eagerly followed the sweep of the cloud of birds was good to see . We hung around the great pointed rock till we saw Mrs. Jack making her way cautiously along the rocks . We rowed at once to the inner rock and placed the luncheon basket in a safe place . We then prepared a little sheltered nook for Mrs. Jack , with rugs and cushions so that she might be quite at ease . Miss Anita chose the place herself . I am bound to say it was not just as I should have selected ; for when she sat down , her back was towards the rock from which she had been rescued . It was doubtless the young girl 's thoughtfulness in keeping her mind away from a place fraught with such unpleasant memories . When she was safely installed we dismissed the boys till the half tide . Mrs. Jack was somewhat tired with her trudge over the sand , and even when we left her she was nodding her head with coming sleep . Then Miss Anita got out her little easel which I fixed for her as she directed ; when her camp stool was rightly placed and her palette prepared I sat down on the rock at her feet and looked at her whilst she began her work . For a little while she painted in silence : then turning to me she said suddenly : '' What about those papers ? Have you found anything yet ? '' It was only then I bethought me of the letter in my pocket . Without a word I took it out and handed it to her . There was a slight blush as well as a smile on her face as she took it . When she saw the date she said impulsively : '' Why did I not get it before ? '' `` Because I had not got your address , and did not know how to reach you . '' `` I see ! '' she answered abstractedly as she began to read . When she had gone right through it she handed it to me and said : '' Now you read it out loud to me whilst I paint ; and let me ask questions so that I may understand . '' So I read ; and now and again she asked me searching questions . Twice or three times I had to read over the memorandum ; but each time she began to understand better and better , and at last said eagerly : '' Have you ever worked out such reductions ? '' `` Not yet , but I could do so . I have been so busy trying to decipher the secret writing that I have not had time to try any such writing myself . '' `` Have you succeeded in any way ? '' `` No ! '' I answered . `` I am sorry to say that as yet I have nothing definite ; though I am bound to say I am satisfied that there is a cipher . '' `` Have you tried both the numbers and the dots ? '' `` Both , '' I answered ; `` but as yet I want a jumping-off place . '' `` Do you really think from what you have studied that the cipher is a biliteral one , or on the basis of a biliteral cipher ? '' `` I do ! I ca n't say exactly how I came to think so ; but I certainly do . '' `` Are there combinations of five ? '' `` Not that I can see . '' `` Are there combinations of less than five ? '' `` There may be . There are certainly . '' `` Then why on earth do n't you begin by reducing the biliteral cipher to the lowest dimensions you can manage ? You may light on something that way . '' A light began to dawn upon me , and I determined that my task -- so soon as my friends had left Cruden -- would be to reduce Bacon 's biliteral . It was with genuine admiration for her suggestion that I answered Miss Anita : '' Your woman 's intuition is quicker than my man 's ratiocination . ' I shall in all my best obey you , Madam ! ' '' She painted away steadily for some time . I was looking at her , covertly but steadily when an odd flash of memory came to me ; without thinking I spoke : '' When I first saw you , as you and Mrs. Jack stood on the rock , and away beyond you the rocks were all fringed with foam , your head looked as if it was decked with flowers . '' For a moment or two she paused before asking : '' What kind of flowers ? '' Once again in our brief acquaintance I stood on guard . There was something in her voice which made me pause . It made my brain whirl , too , but there was a note of warning . At this time , God knows , I did not want any spurring . I was head over heels in love with the girl , and my only fear was lest by precipitancy I should spoil it all . Not for the wide world would I have cancelled the hopes that were dawning in me and filling me with a feverish anxiety . I could not help a sort of satisfied feeling as I answered : '' White flowers ! '' `` Oh ! '' she said impulsively , and then with a blush continued , painting hard as she spoke : '' That is what they put on the dead ! I see ! '' This was a counter-stroke with a vengeance . It would not do to let it pass so I added : '' There is another 'first-column ' function also in which white flowers are used . Besides , they do n't put flowers on the head of corpses . '' `` Of whom then ? '' The note of warning sounded again in the meekness of the voice . But I did not heed it . I did not want to heed it . I answered : '' Of Brides ! '' She made no reply -- in words . She simply raised her eyes and sent one flashing glance through me , and then went on with her work . That glance was to a certain degree encouragement ; but it was to a much greater degree dangerous , for it was full of warning . Although my brain was whirling , I kept my head and let her change the conversation with what meekness I could . We accordingly went back to the cipher . She asked me many questions , and I promised to show her the secret writings when we should go back to the hotel . Here she struck in : '' We have ordered dinner at the hotel ; and you are to dine with us . '' I tried not to tremble as I answered : '' I shall be delighted . '' `` And now , '' she said `` if we are to have lunch here to-day we had better go and wake Mrs. Jack . See ! the tide has been rising all the time we have been talking . It is time to feed the animals . '' Mrs. Jack was surprised when we wakened her ; but she too was ready for lunch . We enjoyed the meal hugely . At half-tide the Hay boys came back . Miss Anita thought that there was enough work for them both in carrying the basket and helping Mrs. Jack back to the carriage . `` You will be able to row all right , will you not ? '' she said , turning to me . `` You know the way now and can steer . I shall not be afraid ! '' When we were well out beyond the rock and could see the figures of Mrs. Jack and the boys getting further away each step , I took my courage in both hands ; I was getting reckless now , and said to her : '' When a man is very anxious about a thing , and is afraid that just for omitting to say what he would like to say , he may lose something that he would give all the rest of the world to have a chance of getting -- do -- do you think he should remain silent ? '' I could see that she , too , could realise a note of warning . There was a primness and a want of the usual reality in her voice as she answered me : '' Silence , they say , is golden . '' I laughed with a dash of bitterness which I could not help feeling as I replied : '' Then in this world the gold of true happiness is only for the dumb ! '' she said nothing but looked out with a sort of steadfast introspective eagerness over the million flashing diamonds of the sea ; I rowed on with all my strength , glad to let go on something . Presently she turned to me , and with all the lambency of her spirit in her face , said with a sweetness which tingled through me : '' Are you not rowing too hard ? You seem anxious to get to Whinnyfold . I fear we shall be there too soon . There is no hurry ; we shall meet the others there in good time . Had you not better keep outside the dangerous rocks . There is not a sail in sight ; not one , so far as I know , over the whole horizon , so you need not fear any collision . Remember , I do not advise you to cease rowing ; for , after all , the current may bear us away if we are merely passive . But row easily ; and we may reach the harbour safely and in good time ! '' Her speech filled me with a flood of feeling which has no name . It was not love ; it was not respect ; it was not worship ; it was not , gratitude . But it was compounded of them all . I had been of late studying secret writing so earnestly that there was now a possible secret meaning in everything I read . But oh ! the poverty of written words beside the gracious richness of speech ! No man who had a heart to feel or a brain to understand could have mistaken her meaning . She gave warning , and hope , and courage , and advice ; all that wife could give husband , or friend give friend . I only looked at her , and without a word held out my hand . She placed hers in it frankly ; for a brief , blissful moment my soul was at one with the brightness of sea and sky . There , in the very spot where I had seen Lauchlane Macleod go down into the deep , my own life took a new being . CHAPTER XI IN THE TWILIGHT It was not without misgiving that I climbed the steep zigzag at Whinnyfold , for at every turn I half expected to see the unwelcome face of Gormala before me . It seemed hardly possible that everything could go on so well with me , and that yet I should not be disturbed by her presence . Miss Anita , I think , saw my uneasiness and guessed the cause of it ; I saw her follow my glances round , and then she too kept an eager look out . We won the top , however , and got into the waiting carriage without mishap . At the hotel she asked me to bring to their sitting-room the papers with the secret writing . She gave a whispered explanation that we should be quite alone as Mrs. Jack always took a nap , when possible , before dinner . She puzzled long and anxiously over the papers and over my enlarged part copy of them . Finally she shook her head and gave it up for the time . Then I told her the chief of the surmises which I had made regarding the means by which the biliteral cipher , did such exist , might be expressed . That it must be by marks of some sort was evident ; but which of those used were applied to this purpose I could not yet make out . When I had exhausted my stock of surmises she said : '' More than ever I am convinced that you must begin by reducing the biliteral cipher . Every time I think of it , it seems plainer to me that Bacon , or any one else using such a system , would naturally perfect it if possible . And now let us forget this for the present . I am sure you must want a rest from thinking of the cipher , and I feel that I do . Dinner is ready ; after it , if you will , I should like another run down to the beach . '' `` _Another_ '' run to the beach ! then she remembered our former one as a sort of fixed point . My heart swelled within me , and my resolution to take my own course , even if it were an unwise one , grew . After dinner , we took our way over the sandhills and along the shore towards the Hawklaw , keeping on the line of hard sand just below high-water mark . The sun was down and the twilight was now beginning . In these northern latitudes twilight is long , and at the beginning differs little from the full light of day . There is a mellowed softness over everything , and all is grey in earth and sea and air . Light , however , there is in abundance at the first . The mystery of twilight , as Southerns know it , comes later on , when the night comes creeping up from over the sea , and the shadows widen into gloom . Still twilight is twilight in any degree of its changing existence ; and the sentiment of twilight is the same all the world over . It is a time of itself ; between the stress and caution of the day , and the silent oblivion of the night : It is an hour when all living things , beasts as well as human , confine themselves to their own business . With the easy relaxation comes something of self-surrender ; soul leans to soul and mind to mind , as does body to body in moments of larger and more complete intention . Just as in the moment after sunset , when the earth is lit not by the narrow disc of the sun but by the glory of the wide heavens above , twin shadows merge into one , so in the twilight two natures which are akin come closer to the identity of one . Between daylight and dark as the myriad sounds of life die away one by one , the chirp of birds , the lowing of cattle , the bleating of sheep , the barking of dogs , so do the natural sounds such as the rustle of trees , the plash of falling water , or the roar of breaking waves wake into a new force that strikes on the ear with a sense of intention or conscious power . It is as though in all the wide circle of nature's might there is never to be such a thing as stagnation ; no moment of poise , save when the spirits of nature proclaim abnormal silence , such as ruled when earth stood `` at gaze , like Joshua 's moon on Ajalon . '' The spirits of my companion and myself yielded to this silent influence of the coming night . Unconsciously we walked close together and in step ; and were silent , wrapt in the beauty around us . To me it was a gentle ecstasy . To be alone with her in such a way , in such a place , was the good of all heaven and all earth in one . And so for many minutes we went slowly on our way along the deserted sand , and in hearing of the music of the sounding sea and the echoing shore . But even Heaven had its revolt . It seems that whether it be on Earth or in Heaven intelligence is not content to remain in a condition of poise . Ever there are heights to be won . Out of my own very happiness and the peace that it gave me , came afresh the wild desire to scale new heights and to make the present altitude which I had achieved a stepping-off place for a loftier height . All arguments seemed to crowd in my mind to prove that I was justified in asking Marjory to be my wife . Other men had asked women whom they had known but a short time to marry them ; and with happy result . It was apparent that at the least she did not dislike me . I was a gentleman , of fair stock , and well-to-do ; I could offer her a true and a whole heart . She , who was seemingly only companion to a wealthy woman , could not be offended at a man 's offering to her all he had to give . I had already approached the subject , and she had not warned me off it ; she had only given me in a sweetly artful way advice in which hope held a distinct place . Above all , the days and hours and moments were flying by . I did not know her address or when I should see her again , or if at all . This latest thought decided me . I would speak plainly to-night . Oh , but men are dull beside women in the way of intuition . This girl seemed to be looking over the sea , and yet with some kind of double glance , such as women have at command , she seemed to have been all the time looking straight through and through me and getting some idea of her own from my changing expression . I suppose the appearance of determination frightened her or set her on guard , for she suddenly said : '' Ought we not to be turning home ? '' `` Not yet ! '' I pleaded , all awake in a moment from my dreams . `` A few minutes , and then we can go back . '' `` Very well , '' she said with a smile , and then added demurely ; `` we must not be long . '' I felt that my hour had come and spoke impulsively : '' Marjory , will you be my wife ? '' Having got out the words I stopped . My heart was beating so heavily that I could not speak more . For a few seconds , which seemed ages to me , we were both silent . I daresay that she may have been prepared for something ; from what I know now I am satisfied that her own intention was to ward off any coming difficulty . But the suddenness and boldness of the question surprised her and embarrassed her to silence . She stopped walking , and as she stood still I could see her bosom heave -- like my own . Then with a great effort , which involved a long breath and the pulling up of her figure and the setting back of her shoulders , she spoke : '' But you know nothing of me ! '' `` I know all of you that I want to know ! '' This truly Hibernian speech amused her , even through her manifest emotion and awkwardness , if one can apply the word to one compact of so many graces . I saw the smile , and it seemed to set us both more at ease . `` That sounds very rude , '' she said `` but I understand what you mean , and take it so . '' This gave me an opening into which I jumped at once . She listened , seeming not displeased at my words ; but on the whole glad of a moment 's pause to collect her thoughts before again speaking : '' I know that you are beautiful ; the most beautiful and graceful girl I ever saw . I know that you are brave and sweet and tender and thoughtful . I know that you are clever and resourceful and tactful . I know that you are a good comrade ; that you are an artist with a poet 's soul . I know that you are the one woman in all the wide world for me ; that having seen you there can never be any one else to take your place in my heart . I know that I would rather die with you in my arms , than live a king with any other queen ! '' `` But you have only seen me twice . How can you know so many nice things about me . I wish they were all true ! I am only a girl ; and I must say it is sweet to hear them , whether they be true or not . Anyhow , supposing them all true , how could you have known them ? '' Hope was stepping beside me now . I went on : '' I did not need a second meeting to know so much . To-day was but a repetition of my joy ; an endorsement of my judgment ; a fresh rivetting of my fetters ! '' She smiled in spite of herself as she replied : '' You leave me dumb . How can I answer or argue with such a conviction . '' Then she laid her hand tenderly on my arm as she went on : '' Oh , I know what you mean , my friend . I take it all in simple truth ; and believe me it makes me proud to hear it , though it also makes me feel somewhat unworthy of so much faith . But there is one other thing which you must consider . In justice to me you must . '' She paused and I felt my heart grow cold . `` What is it ? '' I asked . I tried to speak naturally but I felt that my voice was hoarse . Her answer came slowly , but it seemed to turn me to ice : '' But I do n't know you ! '' There was a pity in her eyes which gave me some comfort , though not much ; a man whose soul is crying out for love does not want pity . Love is a glorious self-surrender ; all spontaneity ; all gladness , all satisfaction , in which doubt and forethought have no part . Pity is a conscious act of the mind ; wherein is a knowledge of one 's own security of foothold . The two can no more mingle than water and oil . The shock had come , and I braced myself to it . I felt that now if ever I should do my devoir as a gentleman . It was my duty as well as my privilege to shield this woman from unnecessary pain and humiliation . Well I knew , that it had been pain to her to say such a thing to me ; and the pain had come from my own selfish impulse . She had warned me earlier in the day , and I had broken through her warning . Now she was put in a false position through my act ; it was necessary I should make her feelings as little painful as I could . I had even then a sort of dim idea that my best plan would have been to have taken her in my arms and kissed her . Had we both been older I might have done so ; but my love was not built in this fashion . Passion was so mingled with respect that the other course , recognition of , and obedience to , her wishes seemed all that was open to me . Besides it flashed across me that she might take it that I was presuming on her own impulsive act on the rock . I said with what good heart I could : '' That is an argument unanswerable , at present . I can only hope that time will stand my friend . Only '' I added and my voice choked as I said it '' Do , do believe that I am in deadly earnest ; that all my life is at stake ; and that I only wait , and I will wait loyally with what patience I can , in obedience to your will . My feelings and my wish , and -- and my request will stand unaltered till I die ! '' She said not a word , but the tears rose up in her beautiful eyes and ran down her blushing cheeks as she held out her hand to me . She did not object when I raised it to my lips and kissed it with all my soul in the kiss ! We turned instinctively and walked homewards . I felt dejected , but not broken . At first the sand seemed to be heavy to my feet ; but when after a little I noticed that my companion walked with a buoyancy unusual even to her , I too became gay again . We came back to the hotel much in the spirit in which we had set out . We found Mrs. Jack dressed , all but her outer cloak , and ready for the road . She went away with Marjory to finish her toilet , but came back before her younger companion . When we were alone she said to me after a few moments of 'hum'ing and 'ha'ing and awkward preparation of speech : '' Oh Mr. Hunter , Marjory tells me that she intends to ride on her bicycle down to Aberdeen from Braemar where we are going on Friday . I am to drive from Braemar to Ballater and then go on by train so that I shall be in before her , though I am to leave later . But I am fearful about the girl riding such a journey by herself . We have no gentleman friend here , and it would be so good of you to take charge of her , if you happened to be anywhere about there . I know I can trust you to take care of her , you have been so good to her , and to me , already . '' My heart leaped . Here was an unexpected chance come my way . Time was showing himself to be my friend already . `` Be quite assured , '' I said as calmly as I could `` I shall be truly glad to be of the least service . And indeed it will just suit my plans , as I hoped to go to Braemar on my bicycle one day very soon and can arrange to go just as may suit you . But of course you understand that I must not go unless Miss Anita wishes it . I could not presume to thrust myself upon her . '' `` Oh that is all right ! '' she answered quickly , so quickly that I took it that she had already considered the matter and was satisfied about it . `` Marjory will not object . '' Just then the young lady entered the room and Mrs. Jack turning to her said : '' I have asked Mr. Hunter my dear to ride down with you from Braemar ; and he says that as it just suits his plans as he was going there he will be very happy if you ask him . '' She smiled as she said : '' Oh since you asked him and he had said yes I need not ask him too ; but I shall be very glad ! '' I bowed . When Mrs. Jack went out , Marjory turning to me said : '' When did you plan to go to Braemar ? '' `` When Mrs. Jack told me you were going '' I answered boldly . `` Oh ! I did n't mean that , '' she said with a slight blush `` but at what time you were to be there . '' To which I said : '' That will be just to suit your convenience . Will you write and let me know ? '' She saw through my ruse of getting a letter , and smilingly held up a warning finger . As we strolled up the road , waiting for the dog-cart to be got ready , she said to me : '' Now you can be a good comrade I know ; and you said that , amongst other things , I was a good comrade . So I am ; and between Braemar and Aberdeen we must both be good comrades . That and nothing more ! Whatever may come after , for good or ill , that time must be kept apart . '' `` Agreed ! '' I said and felt a secret exultation as we joined Mrs. Jack . Before they started Marjory said : '' Mrs. Jack I also have asked Mr. Hunter to come on the ride from Braemar . I thought it would please him if we both asked him , since he is so diffident and unimpulsive ! '' With a smile she said good-bye and waved it with her whip as they started . CHAPTER XII THE CIPHER I went straight to my own room and commenced to work afresh on the biliteral cipher . More than ever had I the conviction upon me that the reading of the secret writing would be the first step to the attainment of my wishes regarding Marjory . It would have been strange therefore if I had not first attempted the method which she had herself suggested , the reducing the Baconian cipher to its lowest elements . For many hours I laboured at this work , and finally when I had reduced the Baconian five symbols to three I felt that I had accomplished all that was possible in that way . [ 2 ] [ 2 ] See Appendix B . When I had arrived at this result , and had tested its accuracy in working , I felt in a position to experiment with my new knowledge on the old number cipher . First I wrote out my method of reduction as a sort of addendum to the paper which I had prepared for Marjory . Then I made a key to cipher and one to de-cipher . [ 3 ] By this time the night was well on and the grey of early morning was beginning to steal in by the edges of the blinds ; I was not sleepy , however ; I was too much excited to think of sleep , for the solving of the problem seemed almost within my grasp . Excited to a state which almost frightened me by its intensity , I got ready my copy of the number cipher and my newly prepared key . With an effort which took me all my resolution I went on steadily writing its proper letter under each combination without once looking back ; for I knew that even should some of the letters be misplaced in the key the chance of recognising the right ones would be largely increased by seeing a considerable number of letters together . [ 3 ] See Appendix C. Then I glanced over the whole and found that many of the symbols made up letters . With such a basis to work on , the rest was only labour . A few tentative efforts and I had corrected the key to agreement with some of the combinations in the cipher . I found , however , that only here and there were letters revealed ; try how I would , I could not piece out the intervening symbols . At last it occurred to me that there might be in the paper two or more ciphers . On trying to follow out the idea , it became apparent that there were at least a quantity of impeding numbers scattered through the cipher . These might be only put in to baffle pursuit , as I had surmised might be done when I made the cipher ; or they might have a more definite purpose . At any rate they hampered my work , so I struck them out as I went along . That I continued till I had exhausted the whole list of numbers in the script . When I looked back over the letters translated from the cipher thus depleted , I found to my inexpressible joy that the sequence and sense were almost complete . The translation read as follows : '' To read the history of the Trust use cipher of Fr . Bacon . The senses and the figures are less worthy than the Trinity B. de E. '' One step more and my work was done . I set the discarded numbers in sequence on another sheet of paper , and found to my intense satisfaction they formed an inner record readable by the same key . The `` encloased '' words , to use Bacon 's phrase , were : '' Treasure Cave cliff one and half degree Northe of East from outer rock . '' Then and then only did I feel tired . The sun was well up but I tumbled into bed and was asleep in a moment . The gong was sounding for breakfast when I awoke . After breakfast when I resumed my work I set myself to construct a variant of my number key to suit the dotted letters , for my best chance , now that I was on the track was to construct rather than to decipher . After some hard work I at last constructed a cipher on this plan . [ 4 ] [ 4 ] See Appendix D. I then began therefore to apply my new key to the copy of the cipher in the printed pages . I worked steadily and completed the whole of the first page , writing down only the answer to those combinations which fitted into my scheme , and leaving all doubtful matters blank . Then I laid aside my key , and with a beating heart glanced over the result . It more than satisfied me , for in the scattered letters though there were many blanks , was manifestly a connected narrative . Then I took the blanks and worked at them altering my key to suit the scheme of the original writer , till by slow degrees I had mastered the secret of the cipher construction . From that hour on , till I had translated the cipher writing from beginning to end I knew no rest that I could avoid . I had to take my meals , and to snatch a few hours of sleep now and again ; for the labour of translation was very arduous and slow , and the strain on my eyes was too great to be kept up continuously ; with each hour , however , I acquired greater facility in the work . It was the evening of the fourth day , however , before my work was complete . I was then absolute master of the writer 's intent . All this time I had not heard from Marjory , and this alone made excessive work a necessary anodyne . Had I not had the long and overwhelming preoccupation to keep my mind from dwelling on the never ending disappointment , I do not know what I should have done . I fully expected a letter by the last post that night . I knew Marjory was staying somewhere in the County ; it was by that post that we received local letters . None came , however , and that night I spent in making a fair transcript of the whole translation . The first part of it was in the shape of a letter , and ran as follows : `` My deare Sonne , These from the towne of Aberdeyne in Scotland wherin I lie sick , and before I go on my quest for the fullfillment of my Trust . I have written , from time to time during my long sickness , a full narrative of what has been ; so that you may know all as though your own ears had heard and your own eyes had seen . All that I have written is to the one end -- that you my eldest sonne and the rest of my children , may , should I fail -- and I am weak in bodie to so strive -- carry on the Trust to which I have pledged you as well as myself ; so that untill that Trust be yielded up complete , neither I nor you nor they are free to any that may clash with the purpose to which our race is henceforth now devoted . But that mine oath may not press overhard on my children , and if need be on their children and their children 's children to the end , it will suffice if one alone at all times shall hold himself or herself pledged to the fullfillment of the Trust . To this end I charge herewith all of my blood and race that the eldest sonne of each generation do hold himself pledged to the purpose of the Trust , unless some other of the direct lineage do undertake it on his behalf . In default of which , or if such undertaken Trust shall fail , then the duty reverteth back and back till one be found whose duty it is by priority of inheritance , unless by some other of the direct lineage the Trust be undertaken on his behalf . And be mindful one and all to whom is this sacred duty that secrecy is of its very essence . The great Trust was to me in the first instance in that His Holiness Pope Sixtus Fifth and my good kinsman known as the Spanish Cardinal held graciouslly that I was one in whose heart the ancient honour of our dear Spain had a place of lodgement so secure that time alone could not efface it nor its continuance in the hearts of my children . To the purpose then of this great Trust His Holiness hath himself given to me and mine full powers of all kinds so to deal with such circumstances as may arise that the labour which we have undertaken may in all cases be brought to a successful issue . To the which His Holiness hath formulated a Quittance which shall be co-existent with the Trust and which shall purge the natural sin of any to whom in the discharge of the duties of the Trust any necessity may arise . But inasmuch as the Trust is a secret one and the undue publication of such Quittance might call the attention of the curious to its existence , such Document is filed in the secret record of the Vatican , where , should necessity hereafter arise , it may be found by the Holy Father who may then occupy the Chair of St. Peter on application made to him on behalf of any who may so offend against law or the rules of well-being which govern the children of Christ . And I charge you , oh ! my sonne to ever bear in mind that though there be some strange things in the narrative they are in mine own eyes true in all ways , though it may appear to you that they accord not with what may be said hereafter of these time 's by other men . `` And oh , my sonne , and my children all , take this my last blessing and with it my counsel that ye walk always in Faith and Righteousness , in Honour and in Good Report , with your duty ever to Holy Church and to the King in loyal service . Farewell ! God and the Blessed Virgin and the Saintes and Angels watch over you and help you that your duty be done . `` Your father in all love , `` BERNARDINO DE ESCOBAN . '' `` These will be brought by a trusty hand , for I fear lest they shall fall into the hands of the English Queene , or any of her hereticall surroundings . If it be that you fail at the first in the speedy fullfillment of the Trust -- as may be , now that the purpose of our great Armada hath been checked -- it may be well that whoso to whom is the Trust may come hither and dwell upon these shores so that he may watch over the purpose of the Trust and be at hand for its fullfillment when occasion may serve . But be mindful ever , oh my sonne , that who so guardeth the Trust will be ever surrounded by enemies , heathenish and without remorse , whose greed should it ever be awakened to this purpose would be fatal to all which we cherish . Dixi . '' Following this came : `` Narrative of Bernardino de Escoban , Knight of the Cross of the Holy See and Grandee of Spain . In this was set out at full length [ 5 ] the history of the great Treasure gathered by Pope Sixtus Fifth for the subjugation of England , and which he entrusted to the writer of the narrative who had at his own cost built and manned one of the vessels of the Armada the _San Cristobal_ flagship of the Squadron of the Galleons of Castile . The Pope , wearied by the demands of Philip of Spain and offended by his claim to appoint bishops under the new domain and further incensed by the incautious insolence of Count de Olivares the Spanish ambassador to Rome , has chosen to make this a secret trust and has on the suggestion of the Spanish Cardinal chosen Don Bernardino de Escoban for the service . In furtherance of his design he has sent him for his new galleon a `` figurehead '' wrought in silver and gold for his own galley by Benvenuto Cellini . Also he has given him as a souvenir a brooch wrought by the same master-hand , the figurehead wrought _in petto_ . Don Bernardino gives account of the defeat of the Armada and tells how his vessel being crippled and he being fearful of the seizure of the treasure entrusted to him buries it and the coveted figurehead in a water cave at the headland of a bay on the coast of Aberdeyne . He has blown up the opening of the cave for safety . In the narrative were certain enlightening phrases such as when the Pope says : [ 5 ] See Appendix E. '' 'To which end I am placing with you a vastness of treasure such as no nation hath ever seen . '' Which was to be applied to only the advancement of the True Faith , and which was in case of failure of the enterprise of the Armada to be given to the custody of whatever King should , after the death of Sixtus V , sit upon the throne . And again : '' 'The Cave was a great one on the south side of the Bay with many windings and blind offsets .... 'The black stone on one hand and the red on the other giving back the blare of the lantern . ' '' The memoranda which follow give the future history of the Trust : `` The narrative of my father , the great and good Don Bernardino de Escoban , I have put in the present form for the preservation of the secret . For inasmuch as the chart to which he has alluded is not to be found , though other papers and charts there be , it may be necessary that a branch of our house may live in this country in obedience to the provision of the Trust and so must learn to speak the English as though it were the mother tongue . As I was but a youth when my father wrote , so many years have elapsed that death has wrought many changes and the hand that should have carried the message and given me the papers and the chart is no more , lying as is thought beside my father amongst the surges of the Skyres . So that only a brief note pointing to the contents of an oaken chest wherein I found them , though incomplete , was all that I had to guide me . The tongue that might have spoken some added words of import was silent for ever `` FRANCISCO DE ESCOBAN . '' `` 23 , October , 1599 . '' `` The narrative of my grandfather , together with my father 's note have I Englished faithfully and put in this secret form for the guidance of those who may follow me , and whose life must be passed in this rigorous clime untill the sacred Trust committed to us by Pope Sixtus the Fifth be fullfilled . When on the death of my elder brother , I being but the second son , I was sent to join my father in Aberdeyne , I made grave preparation for bearing worthily the burden laid upon us by the Trust and so schooled myself in the English that it is now as my mother tongue . Then when my father , having completed the building of his castle , set himself to the finding of the cave whereof the secret was lost , in which emprise he , like my grandfather lost his life amongst the waters of the Skyres of Crudene . Ye that may follow me in the trust regard well this secret writing , made for the confusion of the curious but to the preservation of our secret . Bear ever in mind that not all that is shows on the surface of even simple words . The cipher of my Grandfather devised by Fr . Bacon now High Chancellor of England has many mouths , all of which may speak if there be aught to say . `` BERNARDINO DE ESCOBAN . '' `` 4 , July , 1620 . '' In addition to the cipher narrative I found on close examination that there was a separate cipher running through the marginal notes on the earlier of the printed pages . When translated it ran as follows : `` Cave mouthe northe of outer rock one degree and half North of East . Reef lies from shore point three and half degrees South of South East . '' CHAPTER XIII A RIDE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS I read Don Escoban 's narrative over and over again , till I had thoroughly mastered every detail of it ; then I studied the key of the number cipher till I had it by heart . I had an instinct that memory on this subject would be a help and a safety to me now or hereafter . For now new doubts had begun to assail me . What I had learned was in reality a State secret and had possible consequences or eventualities which , despite the lapse of three centuries , might prove far-reaching and dangerous . The treasure in question was so vast , its purpose so definite , and its guardianship so jealously protected against time and accident , that there was but little chance of forgetfulness regarding it . I was not assailed by moral scruples in any way . The treasure had been amassed and dedicated to the undoing of England ; and for those who had gathered it and sent it forth I had no concern . That it had been hidden in Britain by Britain 's enemies during time of war surely deprived them of all right to recover by legal means . What the law might be on the subject I did not know , and till I knew I cared little . It was a case of `` finders keepers , '' and if I could find it first I held myself justified in using it to my own purposes . All the same I made up my mind to look up the law of Treasure Trove , which I had a hazy idea was in a pretty uncertain condition . At first none of these issues troubled me . They were indeed side issues till the treasure should be found ; when they would become of prime importance . I had felt that my first step to winning the hand of Marjory Anita was to read the cipher . This I had done ; and in the doing had made discovery of a secret of such a nature that it might place me beyond the dreams of avarice , and in a position to ask any girl in the world to marry me . I believe that I regarded the treasure as already my own ; as much as though I had already recovered it from the bowels of the earth . Early in the morning I took my way to Whinnyfold , bringing with me a pocket compass so that I could locate the exact spot where the mouth of the cave had been closed . I knew of course that even granite rocks can not withstand untouched the beating of three centuries of stormy sea , the waste of three hundred summers and winters , and the thousands of nights of bitter frost and days of burning sun which had come to pass since the entrance of the cave had been so rudely shaken down . But I was , I confess , not prepared for the utter annihilation which had come to every trace of its whereabouts . Time after time the sea had bitten into the land ; and falling rocks , and creeping verdure , and drifting sand had changed the sea-front beyond all recognition . I did what I could , however , to take the bearings of the place as laid down by Don de Escoban by walking along the top of the cliff , beginning at the very edge of Witsennan Point till I reached a spot where the south end of the outer rock of the Skares stood out . Then to my surprise I found that it was as near as possible in the direction of my own house . In fact when I looked at the plan which the local surveyor had made of my house I found that the northern wall made a bee line for the south end of the main rock of the Skares . As it was manifest that what had originally been the front of the cave had fallen in and been partly worn and worked away , my remaining hope was that the cave itself lay under part of my ground if not under the house itself . This gave a new feature to the whole affair . If my surmise were correct I need not hurry at all ; the safest thing I could do would be to quietly make an opening from my house into the cave , and explore at leisure . All seemed clear for this proceeding . The workmen who had done the building were gone , and the coming of the decorators had not yet been fixed . I could therefore have the house to myself . As I went back to the hotel , I planned out in my mind how I should get from Glasgow or Aberdeen proper implements for digging and cutting through the rock into the house ; these would be sent in cases , so that no one would suspect what I was undertaking . The work would have to be done by myself if I wished to preserve secrecy . I had now so much to tell Marjory when we should meet that I felt I should hardly know where to begin , and the business side of my mind began to plan and arrange so that all things might come in due order and to the best effect . When I got to the hotel I found awaiting me a letter from Marjory which had come by the last post . I took it away to my room and locked the door before opening it . It had neither address nor date , and was decidedly characteristic : `` My dear Sir : Mrs. Jack asks me to write for her to say that we shall be leaving Braemar on Tuesday . We shall be staying at the Fife Arms Hotel , and she will be very happy if you will breakfast with us at nine o'clock A. M. Room No . 16 . This is all of course in case you care to ride down to Aberdeen . We are breakfasting so early as the ride is long , sixty miles , and Mrs. Jack thinks that I should have a rest at least twice on the way . As I believe you know the road , she will be glad if you will kindly arrange our stopping places . Mrs. Jack will leave Braemar at about three o'clock and drive down to Ballater to catch the half-past five train . She asks me to say that she hopes you will pardon her for the trouble she is giving you , and to impress on you that in case you would rather not come , or should anything occur to prevent you , she will quite understand a telegram with the single word 'regret . ' By the way she will be obliged if you will kindly not mention her name -- either her surname or her Christian name -- before any of the people -- strangers or hotel people , at Braemar or during the journey -- or indeed during the day . Believe me , Yours very truly , `` MARJORY ANITA . '' `` P.S. -- How about the cipher ; have you reduced the biliteral , or got any clue yet ? `` P.P.S. -- I do n't suppose that anything , unless it be really serious , will prevent your coming . Mrs. Jack is so looking forward to my having that bicycle ride . `` P.P.P.S. -- Have you second-sighted any ships yet ? Or any more white flowers -- for the Dead ? '' For long I sat with the letter in my hand after I had read it over and over again many many times . Each time I read it its purpose seemed more luminous . It may have been that my old habit of a year ago of finding secret meanings in everything was creeping back to me . I thought and thought ; and the introspective habit made me reason out causes even in the midst of imaginative flights . `` Might not '' I thought `` it be possible that there be minor forms of Second Sight ; Day Dreams based on some great effort of truth . In the real world there are manifestations of life in lower as well as higher forms ; and yet all alike are instinct with some of that higher principle which divides the quick and the dead . The secret voices of the brain need not always speak in thunder ; the Dream-Painter within us need not always have a full canvas for the exercise of his craft . '' On Tuesday morning when at nine o'clock to the minute I went to the Fife Arms at Braemar , I found Marjory alone . She came forward with a bright , frank smile and shook hands . `` It 's real good to see you '' was all she said . Presently she added : '' Mrs. Jack will be here in a minute or two . Before she comes , it is understood that between this and Aberdeen and indeed for to-day , you and I are only to be comrades . '' `` Yes ! '' said I , and then added : `` Without prejudice ! '' She showed her pearly teeth in a smile as she answered : '' All right . Without prejudice ! Be it so ! '' Then Mrs. Jack came in , and having greeted me warmly , we sat down to breakfast . When this was over , Marjory cut a good packet of sandwiches and tied them up herself . These she handed to me saying : '' You will not mind carrying these . It will be nicer having our lunch out than going to a hotel ; do n't you think so ? '' Needless to say I cordially acquiesced . Both our bicycles were ready at the door , and we lost no time in getting under weigh . Indeed my companion showed some anxiety to be off quickly , as though she wished to avoid observation . The day was glorious . There was bright sunshine ; and a sky of turquoise with here and there a flock of fleecy clouds . The smart easterly breeze swept us along as though we were under sail . The air was cool and the road smooth as asphalt , but with the springiness of well-packed gravel . With the least effort of pedalling we simply seemed to fly . I could see the exhilaration on my companion 's face as clearly as I could feel it in my own nature . All was buoyancy , above , below , around us ; and I doubt if in all the wide circle of the sun 's rays there were two such glad hearts as Marjory 's and my own . As we flew along , the lovely scenery on either hand seemed like an endless panorama . Of high mountains patched with heather which here and there , early in the year as it was , broke out in delicate patches of pink ; of overarching woods whose creaking branches swaying in the wind threw kaleidoscopic patterns of light along our way ; of a brown river fed by endless streams rushing over a bed of stones which here and there lifted their dark heads through the foam of the brown-white water ; of green fields stretching away on either side of the river or rising steeply from our feet to the fringes of high-lying pines or the black mountains which rose just beyond ; of endless aisles of forest where , through the dark shade of the brown trunks , rose from the brown mass of long-fallen pine needles which spread the ground below , and where patches of sunlight fell in places with a seemingly intolerable glare ! Then out into the open again where the sunlight seemed all natural and even the idea of shade unreal . Down steep hills where the ground seemed to slide back underneath our flying wheels , and up lesser hills , swept without effort by the wind behind us and the swift impetus of our pace . After a while the mountains before us , which at first had seemed like an unbroken line of frowning giants barring our course , seemed to open a way to us . Round and round we swept , curve after curve yielding and falling back and opening new vistas ; till at the last we passed into the open gap between the hills around Ballater . Here in the face of possible danger we began to crawl cautiously down the steep hill to the town . Mrs. Jack had proposed that we should make our first halt at Ballater . As , however , we put on pace again at the foot of the hill Marjory said : '' Oh do not let us stop in a town . I could not bear it just after that lovely ride through the mountains . '' `` Agreed ! '' I said `` let us push on ! That twenty miles seems like nothing . Beyond Cambus-o-May there is a lake on the northern side ; we can ride round it and come back to the road again at Dinnet . If you like we can have our lunch in the shelter of a lovely wood at the far side of it . '' `` That will be enchanting ! '' she said , and the happy girlish freshness of her voice was like a strain of music which suited well the scene . When we had passed Ballater and climbed the hill up to the railway bridge we stopped to look back ; and in sheer delight she caught hold of my arm and stood close to me . And no wonder she was moved , for in the world there can be few places of equal beauty of a similar kind . Right above us to the right , and again across the valley , towered mountains of rich brown with patches of purple and lines of green ; and in front of us in the centre of the amphitheatre , two round hills , looming large in a delicate mist , served as portals to the valley which trended upward between the hills beyond . The road to Braemar seemed like a veritable road of mystery , guarded by an enchanted gate . With a sigh we turned our backs on all this beauty , and skirting the river , ran by Cambus-o-May and between woods of pine in an opening vista of new loveliness . Eastward before us lay a mighty sweep of hill and moor , backed on every side by great mountains which fell away one behind the other into misty distance of delicate blue . At our feet far below , lay two spreading lakes of sapphire hue , fringed here and there with woods , and dotted with little islands whose trees bent down to the water 's edge . Marjory stood rapt for awhile , her breast heaving and her face glowing . At last she turned to me with a sigh ; her beautiful eyes were bright with unshed tears as she said : '' Oh , was there ever in the world anything so beautiful as this Country ! And was there ever so exquisite a ride as ours to-day ! '' Does ever a man love a woman more than when she shows herself susceptible to beauty , and is moved to the fulness and simplicity of emotion which is denied to his own sex ? I thought not , as Marjory and I swept down the steep road and skirted by the crystal lakes of Ceander and Davan to the wood in which we were to have our _al fresco_ lunch . Here , sheltered from the wind , the sunshine seemed too strong to make sitting in the open pleasant ; and we were glad to have the shade of the trees . As we sat down and I began to unpack the luncheon , Marjory said : '' And now tell me how you have been getting on with the cipher . '' I stood still for so long that she raised her head and took a sharp glance of surprise at me . In the charm of her presence I had absolutely forgotten all about the cipher and what might grow from it . CHAPTER XIV A SECRET SHARED '' There is so much to tell '' I said `` that I hardly know where to begin . Perhaps I had better tell you all here , where we are alone and not likely to be disturbed . We have come so fast that we have lots of time and we need not hurry . When you have had your lunch I shall tell you all . '' `` Oh please do n't wait till then , '' she said , `` I am all impatience . Let me know right away . '' `` Young woman '' I said sternly `` you are at present insincere . You _know_ you are ravenously hungry , as you should be after a twenty mile ride ; and you are speaking according to your idea of convention and not out of your heart . This is not convention ; there is nothing conventional in the whole outfit . Eat the food prepared for you by the thoughtfulness of a very beautiful and charming girl ! '' She held up a warning finger and said : '' Remember '_Bon Camarade_ -- without prejudice . ' '' `` All right '' I answered `` so it shall be . But if the lady wants to hold me up for criminal libel I shall undertake to repeat the expression when , and where , and how she will . I shall repeat the assertion and abide by the consequences . '' She went on eating her sandwiches , not , I thought , displeased . When we had both finished she turned to me and said : '' Now ! '' I took from my pocket the rescript of Don Bernardino de Escoban 's narrative and handed it to her . She looked at it , turned over the pages , and glanced at them as she went . Then she returned to the beginning , and after reading the first few lines , said to me with an eager look in her eyes : '' Is this really the translation of the secret writing ? Oh , I am so glad you have succeeded . You are cute ! '' She took out her watch , and having looked at it , went on : `` We have loads of time . Wo n't you read it for me ? It will be so much nicer ! And let me ask you questions . '' `` Delighted ! '' I answered , `` But would it not be better if I read it right through first , and then let you ask questions ! Or better still you read it yourself right through , and then ask . '' I had a purpose in this . If I had to read it , my eyes must be wholly engrossed in my work ; but if she read , I need never take them off her face . I longed to see the varying expression with which she would follow every phase of the strange story . She thought for a few seconds before answering , and as she thought looked me straight in the eyes . I think she read my secret , or at any rate enough of it to fathom my wish ; nothing else could account for the gentle blush that spread over her face . Then she said in quite a meek tone : '' I shall read it myself if you think it best ! '' I shall never forget that reading . Her face , always expressive , was to me like an open book . I was by this time quite familiar with de Escoban 's narrative , as I had with infinite patience dug it out letter by letter from the cipher in which it had been buried for so long . As also I had written it out fair twice over , it was little wonder that I knew it well . As she read I so followed that I could have told to a sentence how far she had got in the history . Once she unconsciously put her hand to her throat and felt the brooch ; but immediately drew it away again , glancing for a moment at me from under her eyelashes to see whether I had observed . She saw I had , shook her head with a smile , and read on . When she had finished reading , she gave a long sigh and then held out her hand to me saying : '' Bravo ! I congratulate you with all my heart ! '' Her touch thrilled me ; she was all on fire , and there was a purposeful look in her face which was outside and beyond any joy that she could have with regard to any success of mine . This struck me so much that I said impulsively : '' Why are you so glad ? '' She answered instinctively and without thought : '' Because you will keep it from the Spaniards ! '' Then she stopped suddenly , with a gesture of self repression . I felt a little piqued . I would have thought that her concern would have been rather individual than political . That in such a matter even before racial hatred would have come gladness at the well-doing of even such a friend -- without prejudice -- as I was . Looking at me , she seemed to see through me and said `` With her two white hands extended , as if praying one offended : '' '' Oh , I am sorry ! I did not mean to hurt you . I ca n't explain yet ; not to-day , which is for comradeship only. -- Yes without prejudice '' -- for she saw my look and answered it `` But some day you will understand . '' She was so evidently embarrassed and pained at having for some reason which I did not comprehend to show reticence to me who had been so open with her , that I felt it my duty to put her at ease . This I tried to do by assuring her that I quite understood that she had some good reason , and that I was quite content to wait . I could not help adding before I stopped : `` This is a small thing to have to wait for after all ; when I have to wait for something so much more important . '' The warning finger was held up again with a smile . Then we went over the whole of the narrative again , I reading this time and she stopping to ask me questions . There was not much to ask ; all the story was so plain that the proceeding did not take very long . Then she asked me to explain how I had come to decipher the cryptogram . I took out my pocket book and proceeded to make a key to the cipher , explaining as I went on the principle . `` To me , '' I said , `` it is very complete , and can be used in an infinity of ways . Any mode of expression can be used that has two objects with five varieties of each . '' Here she interrupted me . As I was explaining I was holding out my hands with the fingers spread as a natural way of expressing my meaning . She saw at once what had escaped me , and clasping her hands exclaimed impulsively : '' Like your two hands ! It is delightful ! Two hands , and five fingers on each . We can talk a new deaf and dumb alphabet ; which no one but ourselves can understand ! '' Her words thrilled through me . One more secret to share with her ; one more secret which would be in perpetual exercise , in pursuance of a common thought . I was about to speak when she stopped me with a gesture . `` Sorry ! '' she said . `` Go on ; explain to me ! We can think of variety later ! '' So I continued : '' So long as we have means that are suitable , we have only to translate into the biliteral , and we who know this can understand . Thus we have a double guard of secrecy . There are some who could translate into symbols with which they are familiar , symbols with which they are not ; but in this method we have a buffer of ignorance or mystery between the known and the unknown . There is also this advantage ; the cipher as it stands is sufficiently on a basis of science or at any rate of order , that its key is easily capable of reproduction . As you have seen , I can make a key without any help . Bacon 's biliteral cipher is scientifically accurate . It can , therefore , be easily reproduced ; the method of exclusions is also entirely rational , so that we need have no difficulty in remembering it . If two people would take the trouble to learn the symbols of the biliteral , as kept after the exclusions and which are used in this cipher , they might with very little practice be able to write or read off-hand . Indeed the suggestion , which you have just made , of a deaf-and-dumb alphabet is capital . It is as simple as the daylight ! You have only to decide whether the thumb or the little finger means 1 or 2 ; and then reproduce by right hand or left , and using the fingers of each hand , the five symbols of the amended biliteral , and you can talk as well and as easily as do the deaf mutes ! '' Again she spoke out impulsively : '' Let us both learn off by heart the symbols of our cipher ; and then we sha n't want even to make a key . We can talk to each other in a crowd , and no one be the wiser of what we are saying . '' This was very sweet to me . When a man is in love , as I was , anything which links him to his lady , and to her alone , has a charm beyond words . Here was a perpetual link , if we cared to make it so , and if the Fates would be good to us . `` The Fates ! '' With the thought came back Gormala 's words to me at the beginning . She had told me , and somehow I seemed to have always believed the same , that the Fates worked to their own end and in their own way . Kindness or unkindness had no part in their workings ; pity had no place at the beginning of their interest , no more than had remorse at the end . Was it possible that in the scheme of Fate , in which Gormala and I and Lauchlane Macleod had places , there was also a place for Marjory ? The Witch-woman had said that the Fates would work their will , though for the doing of it came elements out of past centuries and from the ends of the earth . The cipher of Don de Escoban had lain hidden three centuries , only to be revived at its due time . Marjory had come from a nation which had no existence when the Don had lived , and from a place which in his time was the far home of the red man and the wolf and the bison and the bear . But yet what was there to connect Marjory with Don de Escoban and his secret ? As I thought , I saw Marjory who had turned her back to me , quietly take something from her throat and put it into her pocket . Here was the clue indeed . The brooch ! When I had taken it up from the sea at the Sand Craigs I had returned it to her with only a glance ; and as I had often seen it since , without any mystery , I had hardly noticed it . It rushed in on my mind that it was of the same form as that described by Don de Escoban as having been given by the Pope . I had only noticed a big figure and a little one ; but surely it could be none other than a figure of St. Christopher . I should have liked to have asked Marjory about it at once ; but her words already spoken putting off explanation , and her recent act , of which I was supposed to know nothing , in putting it out of sight , forbade me to inquire . All the more I thought , however ; and other matters regarding it crowded into my mind . The chain was complete , the only weak link being the connection between Marjory and the St. Christopher brooch . And even here there was a mystery , acknowledged in her concealment , which might explain itself when the time came . Matters took such a grave turn for me with my latest surmise , that I thought it would be well to improve the occasion with Marjory , in so far as it might be possible to learn something of her surroundings . I was barred from asking questions by her own wish ; but still I did not like to lose the chance without an effort , so I said to her : '' We have learned a lot to-day , have n't we ? '' `` Indeed we have . It hardly seems possible that a day could make such a change ! '' `` I suppose we should take it that new knowledge should apply new conditions to established fact ? '' I said this with some diffidence ; and I could see that the change in my tone , much against my will , attracted her attention . She evidently understood my wish , for she answered with decision : '' If you mean by 'new conditions ' any alteration of the compact made between us for to-day -- yes , I remember 'without prejudice ' -- there is nothing in our new knowledge to alter the old ones . Do remember , sir , that this day is one set apart , and nothing that is not a very grave matter indeed can be allowed to alter what is established regarding it . '' `` Then , '' said I , `` at all events let us learn the cipher -- our cipher as you very properly called it . '' `` Oh no ! surely ? '' this was said with a rising blush . `` Indeed , yes -- I am glad to say ! '' `` Take care ! '' she replied , meaningly , then she added : '' Very well ! Ours let it be . But really and truly I have no right to its discovery ; it makes me feel like a fraud to hear you say so . '' `` Be easy , '' I replied . `` You helped me more than I can say . It was your suggestion to reduce the terms of the biliteral ; and it was by that means that I read the cipher . But at any rate when we call it 'ours ' it will content me if the word 'ours ' '' -- I could not help repeating the word for it was delight to me ; it did not displease her either , though it made her blush -- '' is applied not to invention but to possession ! '' `` All right , '' she said . `` That is good of you . I can not argue with you . Amendment accepted ! Come , let us get on our wheels again . You have the key of _our_ cipher with you ; you can tell me the items one by one , and we will learn them as we go along . '' And so as we swept round Davan Lake , with the wind behind us driving us along except just before we regained the high road at Dinnet , I repeated the symbols of the reduced biliteral . We went over and over them again and again , till we were unable to puzzle each other questioning up and down , 'dodging ' as the school-boys say . Oh , but that ride was delightful ! There was some sort of conscious equality between us which I could see my comrade felt as well as myself . Down the falling road we sped almost without effort , our wheels seeming to glide on air . When we came to the bridge over the railway just above Aboyne , where the river comes north and runs in under a bank of shale and rock , we dismounted and looked back . Behind us was our last view of the gorge above Ballater , where the two round hills stood as portals , and where the cloud rack hanging above and beyond made a mystery which was full of delightful fascination and no less delightful remembrance . Then with a sigh we turned . There , before us lay a dark alley between the closing pines . No less mysterious , but seemingly dark and grim . CHAPTER XV A PECULIAR DINNER-PARTY We did not stop at Aboyne , but ran on beyond Kincardine O'Neill , and took our second rest close to the Bridge of Potarch where we had tea at the little hotel on the right bank of the river . Then for a while we leaned over the parapet and looked at the water flowing swiftly far below as the river narrows from its pebbly bed to the gorge of rock on which the bridge rests . There is something soothing , perhaps something hypnotic , in the ceaseless rush of water . It unconsciously takes one's thoughts on and on , till the reality of the present is in some measure lost and the mind wanders towards imagination through the regions of the unknown . As I looked at Marjory , with the afternoon sun falling on her superb figure and showing up her clear-cut profile with all the finish of a cameo , I could not but be struck with the union of gentleness and independence which was so clearly manifested in her . Without thinking , I spoke out my mind . It is a privilege of those who understand each other , or of the very young , to give voice to the latter portion of a train of thought without feeling it necessary to enlighten the hearer as to what has gone to make up the conclusion . The feeling was hourly growing upon me that , even if I could not quite understand Marjory , at least she understood me . `` But then all you American girls are so independent ! '' She did not seem a bit surprised by this fag end of reasoning ; she had evidently been following up some train of thought of her own , and by some happy instinct my words fitted in with it . Without turning towards me , but still keeping her eyes fixed down the stream to where far away it swayed to the right through a gap between pine clad hills she answered : '' Yes ! We are as a rule brought up to be independent . It seems to be a part of what our people call the 'genius ' of the country . Indeed for many , women as well as men , it is a sort of necessity . Our nation is so vast , and it expands so quickly , that there is nearly everywhere a family separation . In the main , all the children of one generation become the heads of families of the next . Somehow , the bulk of our young people still follow the sunset ; and in the new life which comes to each , whether in the fields or in the city or in the reclamation of the wilderness , the one thing which makes life endurable is this independence which is another form of self-reliance . This it is which enables them to brave hunger and thirst and all danger which comes to pioneers ; which in the cities makes the solitude of lonely life bearable to the young as well as to the old ; which makes them work and study in patience ; which makes them self-sacrificing , and thrifty , and long enduring . I tell you it is this which makes a race of patriots , whose voices swell in unison till the great voice of the nation , raised in some good cause , can ring and echo through the world ! '' As she spoke she got more and more earnest , more and more enthusiastic , till her voice began to vibrate and her face to flush . When she turned towards me at the end , her eyes were full of spiritual light . I looked at her , and I suppose my love as well as my admiration must have expressed itself , for her eyes fell and the flush on her face melted into a soft blush . She turned , looked at the water again , and then went on speaking : '' This is the good side of our independence and _faute de mieux_ it serves ; those who know no better do not miss what might be . But oh ! it has to be paid for . The little sufferings of day by day can grow into a mass which in the end outweighs those seemingly far greater ills which manifest themselves all at once . No one knows , no one ever will know , how much quiet , dull pain goes to tame a woman 's heart to the solitude of life . I have not seen so much of it as some others ; my life has been laid in pleasant places , and only through the small accidents of life have I come to know of the negative pain which other girls have to endure . It is so much to have round one the familiar faces of our youth ; to meet sympathy at every turn of life , and to know that there is understanding for us always . We women have to give something in order to be happy . The stronger-minded ones , as we call them , blame the Creator for this disposition of things -- or else I do not know who or what they blame ; but the rest of us , who are wise enough to accept what can not be altered , try to realise what can be done for the best . We all want to care for some one or something , if it is only a cat or a dog . For myself , so far back as I can remember , I longed to have a brother or sister , but I think that in my secret heart it was a brother I wanted . Of course as I merged into my actual surroundings I grew out of this ; but once it was brought home to me with new force . We were staying for a few days in one of those great English houses where there was a growing family of boys and girls . There was one sweet young girl , just about my own age , who seemed idolised by all her brothers . When we arrived they were all going in to evening prayers . The last of the sunlight was falling through the old stained glass window of the great baronial hall , and lit up the little family group . The girl sat between two of her young brothers , great stalwart lads who had all the characteristics of a family of soldiers . During prayers each of them held one of her hands ; and when they all knelt , her arms went round their necks . I could not help feeling deeply -- down into the very depths of my soul -- how good it was for them all . I would have given everything I have , or am ever likely to have , that mine had been such an upbringing . Think , how in after years it will come back to those boys in hours of trial , or pain , or prosperity , or passion ; in all times when their manhood or their honour or their worth is to be tried ; how they will remember the words which were spoken to them as those were spoken , and were listened to as those were listened to , in the midst of sympathy and love . Many and many a time in years to come those boys will bless such hours , and God Himself will surely rejoice that His will was being wrought in so sweet a way . And the same thing is going on in a thousand English homes ! '' She paused and turned to me and the feeling in her heart found expression in the silent tears that ran down her cheeks . Again she turned her eyes to the running water and gazed awhile before speaking again . Then looking at me , she went on : '' And the girl , too , how good it was for her ! What an antidote to selfishness ! How much of self-control , of sympathy , of love , of toleration was begun and fostered and completed in those moments of the expression of her heart ! What place can there really be for selfish want and sorrows in the heart of a woman so trained to sympathise with and help others ? It is good ! good ! good ! and I pray that in the later development of my own dear country , all such things may have a part . Expansion at its present rate must soon cease ; and then some predominant idea must take the place of the eternal self-independence . We shall , I trust , moult no feather of our national feeling of personal duty ; but I am sure that our people , and more especially our women , will lead happier as well as healthier lives . '' This present phase of Marjory 's character was new to me , fresh and enchanting . Every hour seemed to bring out new worths and beauties of the girl 's character , of her intellectual gifts , of the endless wealth of her heart . When she ceased speaking I took her hand in mine , she not resenting , and kissed it . I said only one word `` Marjory ! '' but it was enough . I could see that in her eyes which made my heart leap . Then a new life seemed to come to both of us . With one accord we moved towards our bicycles , and mounted in silence . After a few minutes of rapid spin down the sloping road from the bridge , we began to chat again gaily . For myself I was in wildly joyous spirits . Even a self-doubting lover could not fail to understand such a look in his mistress 's eyes . If ever love spoke out in eloquent silence it was then , all doubt melted from my heart , as the night shadows pale before the dawn . I was content to wait now , illimitably and in silence . She , too , seemed altogether happy , and accepted in unquestioning faith all the little pleasures which came in the progress of our journey . And such pleasures are many . As we drew down the valley of the Dee , with the mountains falling back and the dark pinewoods running up them like tongues of flame and emphasising by their gloom the brightness of grass and heather which cropped up amongst the rocks beyond , every turn of the road brought us to some new scene of peaceful beauty . From under the splendid woods of Crathes Castle we saw the river running like a blue ribbon far to the east and on either side of it fields and gardens and woods spreading wide . On we sped with delight in every moment , till at last through miles of shady woods we came to the great stone bridge , and ended our jaunt over the rough granite cobblestones of Aberdeen . We were a little before the time the train was due ; so leaving our wheels in the Palace Hotel we went down on the platform to meet Mrs. Jack on her arrival . We met her in due course , and brought her up to the hotel . At the stairway Marjory , who had lingered half a flight behind her companion , whispered to me : '' You have been a good boy to-day , a real good boy ; and you shall before long have your reward . '' As she gave me her hand , I whispered : '' I am content to wait now Marjory ; dear Marjory ! '' She blushed and smiled , and fled upstairs with a warning finger laid upon her lips . It had been understood that I was to dine with Mrs. Jack and her friend , so I went up to the room which I had secured , to change my clothes . When I came down , in what I thought was a reasonable time , I went to the private sitting-room and knocked . As there was no answer I knocked again ; then receiving no reply I took it for granted that the ladies had not yet come from their rooms and entered . The room was empty but on the table which was laid for dinner for three was a note in Marjory 's hand directed to me . With a sinking of the heart I opened it , and stood for a few minutes amazed . It had no apostrophe and ran as follows : -- `` We have had to leave suddenly , but Mrs. Jack wants you to oblige her very much if you will be so good . Stay in the room , and when dinner is served sit down by yourself and eat it . Please , please do not think hardly of Mrs. Jack 's request ; and do not fail to carry it out . There is good reason for it , as you will very soon know . More depends on your doing as Mrs. Jack '' -- the `` Mrs. Jack '' was written over an obliterated `` I '' -- '' asks than you may think . I am sure that by this time you know you can trust me . `` MARJORY . '' The situation was disappointing and both humiliating and embarrassing . To be a guest under such conditions was almost ridiculous ; and under ordinary circumstances I should have refused . But then I remembered that last look of Marjory 's eyes at the bridge of Potarch ! Without a word , or another thought , of revolt I sat down to the dinner which the waiter was just now bringing into the room . As it was evident to me that my staying in the room was for some purpose of delay , I lingered over my wine and had two cigars before I came away . CHAPTER XVI REVELATIONS In the hall I met together two men whom I knew well . The first was Adams of the American Embassy in London ; the second Cathcart of the British Embassy at Washington , now on leave . I had not seen either for two years , and it was with mutual pleasure that we met . After our preliminary handshaking , and the inevitable drink at the American's request , Adams slapped me on the shoulder and said heartily : '' Well , old fellow , I congratulate you ; or rather am I to congratulate you ? '' `` What do you mean ? '' I asked in feeble embarrassment . `` All right , old chap ! '' he said heartily . `` Your blush is enough . I see it has n't come off yet at all events ! '' A man never lets well alone when he is in an awkward position . If I had only held my tongue I might not have made a guy of myself ; but as I was in doubt as to what might be the issue of my suit to Marjory , I felt additionally constrained to affect ignorance of his meaning . So I floundered on : '' 'Come off yet ' ? What on earth do you mean ? '' Again he slapped me on the back as he said in his chaffing way : '' My dear boy I saw you come in over the bridge . You had had a long ride I could see by your wheels ; and I am bound to say that you did seem on excellent terms with each other ! '' This was getting dangerous ground , so I tried to sheer off . `` Oh , '' I said , `` you mean my bike ride with Miss Anita '' -- I was interrupted by his sudden whistle . `` Oh , '' he said in exact imitation of my own manner . `` You mean Miss Anita ! So it has come to that already ! Anyhow I congratulate you heartily , whether it has come , or may come , or will come to anything else . '' `` I do n't see , '' I said , with a helpless feeling of having been driven into a corner , `` that there is anything especially remarkable in a man having a bicycle ride with a young lady of his acquaintance . '' `` Keep your hair on , old man ! '' he said with a smile . `` There is nothing remarkable about a man riding with a young lady ; but there is something very remarkable about any man riding with this particular young lady . Why , man alive , do n't you know that there is n't a man in America , or out of it , that would n't give the eyes out of his head to take your place on such an occasion . To ride alone with Marjory Drake -- '' '' With whom ? '' I said impulsively ; and having spoken could have bitten out my tongue . Adams paused ; he was silent so long that I began to grow uneasy . His face grew very grave , and there spread over it that look between cunning and dominance which was his official expression . Then he spoke , but his words had not the same careless ring in them . There was a manifest caution and a certain indefinable sense of distance . `` Look here , Archie Hunter ! Is it possible that you do n't know who it is that you were with . All right ! I know of course that you are acquainted with her personally , '' for he saw I was about to protest , `` the very fact of your being with her and your knowing the name that she seldom uses answer for that ; and you may take it from me that the lady needs no character for discretion from me . But how is it that you are on such good terms with her , and yet do n't seem even to know her name ? '' For fully a minute there was silence between us . Cathcart had as yet said not a word , and Adams was thinking . For myself I was in a sea of multitudinous concerns ; whichever way I turned I was face to face with some new difficulty . It would not do to leave these men under the impression that there was any social irregularity in my friendship with Marjory ; I was too jealous of her good name to allow such a thing to be possible . And yet I could not explain at length how we had come to be such good friends . Already there were so many little mysteries ; right up to this very evening when she and Mrs. Jack had gone away so strangely , leaving me in the ridiculous position of a guest with no host . It was not easy to explain these things ; it was impossible to avoid them . In the midst of this chaotic whirl of thoughts Adams spoke : '' I think I had better say no more , anyhow . After all , if Miss Drake chooses to keep a secret , or to make one , it is not my business to give it , or her , away . She knows what she 's doing . You will excuse me , old fellow , wo n't you ; but as it is manifestly a lady 's wish , I think I can do best by holding my tongue . '' `` Any wish of that lady 's , '' said I , and I felt that I must seem to speak grandiloquently , `` can only have my most loyal support . '' There was an awkward silence which was relieved by Cathcart , who said to me : '' Come up to my room , Archie ; I want to tell you something . You 'll join us , too , Sam , wo n't you ? '' `` All right , Billy , '' said Adams , `` I 'll come in a few minutes . I want to give some directions about a horse for to-morrow . '' When we were in Cathcart 's room , he closed the door and said to me with the most genuine good feeling : '' I did n't like to say a word downstairs , old chap ; but I could see you were in some difficulty . Of course I know it 's all right ; but ought you not to know something of the lady ? With any one else but Sam and myself such a thing might have conveyed a false impression . Surely you can best protect the lady by knowing how to avoid anything that might embarrass her ! '' This was all good sound common sense . For a moment I weighed up the matter against the possibility of Marjory 's wishing to keep her name a secret . Looking back , however , I could see that any concealment that had been was rather positive than negative . The original error had been mine ; she had simply allowed it to pass . The whole thing had probably been the passing fancy of a bright , spirited young girl ; to take it too seriously , or to make too much of it might do harm . Why , even these men might , were I to regard it as important , take it as some piece of deliberate deceit on her part . Thus convinced of the wisdom of Cathcart 's proposition I spoke : '' You are quite right ! and I shall be much obliged if you will -- if you will enlighten me . '' He bowed and smiled , and went on genially : '' The lady you called Miss Anita , you so far called quite correctly . Her name is Anita ; but it is only her second Christian name . She is known to the world as Miss Marjory Drake , of Chicago . '' `` Known to the world . '' Was this a mere phrase , or the simple expression of a fact ! I asked directly : '' How known to the world ? Do you mean that is the name known amongst her circle of acquaintances ? Is -- is there any cause why the great world outside that circle should know her at all ? '' He smiled and laid his hand on my shoulder in a very brotherly way as he answered : '' Yes , old fellow . There is a reason , and a good one , why the great world should know her . I see you are all in the dark ; so I had better tell you what I know . Marjory Anita Drake is an heiress , a great heiress , a very great heiress ; perhaps a long way the greatest heiress in America , or out of it . Her father , who died when she was a baby , left her a gigantic fortune ; and her trustees have multiplied it over and over again . '' He paused ; so I said -- it seeming necessary to say something : '' But being an heiress is not sufficient reason why a girl should be known to the world . '' `` It is a pretty good one . Most people would n't want any better . But this is not the reason in her case . She is the girl who gave the battle ship to the American Government ! '' `` Gave the battle ship ! I do n't understand ! '' `` It was this way . At the time the reports kept crowding in of the Spanish atrocities on the _reconcentrados_ ; when public feeling was rising in the United States , this girl got all on fire to free Cuba . To this end she bought a battle ship that the Cramp 's had built for Japan . She had the ship armed with Krupp cannon which she bought through friends in Italy ; and went along the Eastern coast amongst the sailors and fishermen till she had recruited a crew . Then she handed the whole thing over to the Government as a spur to it to take some action . The ship is officered with men from the Naval Academy at Annapolis ; and they tell me there is n't one of the crew -- from the cabin boy to the captain -- that would n't die for the girl to-morrow . '' `` Bravo ! '' I said instinctively ! `` That 's a girl for a nation to be proud of ! '' `` She is all that ! '' said Cathcart enthusiastically . `` Now you can understand why Adams congratulated you ; and why he was so surprised when you did not seem to know who she was . '' I stood for a moment thinking , and all the clouds which wrapped Marjory 's purpose in mystery seemed to disperse . This , then , was why she allowed the error of her name to pass . She had not made an _incognita_ ; chance had done this for her , and she had simply accepted it . Doubtless , wearied with praise and with publicity and notoriety in all its popular forms , she was glad to get away and hide herself for a while . Fortune had thrown in her way a man who was manifestly ignorant of her very existence ; and it was a pleasure to play with him at hide-and-seek ! It was , after all , an up-to-date story of the Princess in disguise ; and I was the young man , all unknowing , with whom she had played . Here a terrible doubt assailed me . Other Princesses had played hide-and-seek ; and , having had their sport , had vanished ; leaving desolation and an empty heart behind them . Was it possible that she too was like this ; that she had been all the while playing with me ; that even whilst she was being most gracious , she was taking steps to hide even her whereabouts from me ? Here was I , who had even proposed marriage ; and yet who did not even know when or where I should see her again -- if indeed I should ever see her again at all . I could not believe it . I had looked into her eyes , and had seen the truth . Here was no wanton playing at bowls with men 's hearts . My life upon her faith ! I seemed to have lost myself in a sort of trance . I was recalled from it by Cathcart , who seeing me in a reverie had gone over to the fireplace and stood with his back to me , filling his pipe at the mantel-piece : '' I think I hear Adams coming . Pardon me , old fellow , but though I am sure he knows I have told you about Miss Drake , and though he probably made an excuse for delay so that I might have an opportunity to do so , he wants to appear not to enter on the subject . He is _diplomat_ all over . Remember he is of the U. S. Embassy ; and Miss Drake , as an American citizen , is theoretically under his care in this foreign country . Let us be talking of something else when he comes in ! '' Sam came along the passage softly whistling a bar of `` Yankee Doodle . '' Cathcart nodded to me and whispered : '' I told you so ! He takes good care that he may not surprise us . '' When he came in we were talking of the prospects of the Autumn fishing on the Dee . When we left Cathcart 's room , after a cigar , I , being somewhat tired with my long ride , went at once to my room . Adams came with me as far as the door . I was just getting into bed when I heard a slight tap at the door . I unlocked it and found Adams without . He raised a warning hand , and said in a whisper : '' May I come in ? I want to say something very privately . '' More than ever mystified -- everything seemed a mystery now -- I opened the door . He came in and I closed it softly and locked it . CHAPTER XVII SAM ADAMS 'S TASK Adams began at once : `` Archie I want to tell you something ; but it is in the strictest confidence . You must promise me not to mention to any one , mind _any one_ , what I say ; or even that I have spoken to you on the subject . '' I thought for a moment before replying . It flashed across me that what he had to say must concern Marjory , so I answered : '' I fear I can not make such a promise , if the matter is regarding some one other than myself . '' A shade of annoyance passed across his face as he said : '' Well , it is about some one else ; but really you must trust me . I would not for the world , old fellow , ask you to do anything that was not correct . '' `` I know that '' I said `` I know it right well ; but you see it might be regarding some one with whom my relations might be peculiar -- not fixed you know . It might be necessary for me to speak . Perhaps not now ; but later on . '' I was stumbling blindly , so sought refuge in fact and query , '' Tell me '' I said `` does it relate to Miss Drake ? '' `` It does ; but I thought that you who are a friend of hers might like to do her a service . '' `` Of course I would . '' I answered . `` There is nothing I would not do for her if it were in my power . '' `` Except hold your tongue ! '' he said with a touch of bitterness unusual with him . I could see that anxious as I was to hear he was still more anxious to tell me ; so I was able to keep my temper and not make matters worse by answering back sarcastically . I said : '' Yes , old chap , even by holding my tongue . If I could see that I would benefit her by holding my tongue , or by cutting out my tongue , I would do it . What I must refuse is to _promise_ to hold my tongue . Come , old fellow , do n't put me in a wrong position . You do n't know all that I do , or exactly how I am placed . Why do n't you trust me ? I am willing to promise that I wo n't speak at all of the matter unless it be necessary ; and that I wo n't speak at all in any case of having been told anything by you . '' He brightened up at once and said : '' All right , then we can drive on . I take it that since we met last '' -- that was a few minutes ago , but he was a diplomatist -- '' you have learned more about Miss Drake , or rather of her history and her position and importance , than you knew at that time ? '' `` Yes , '' I answered , and I could not help smiling . `` Then we need n't go into that . We take facts for granted . Well , that fine act of hers -- you know what I mean -- has brought her , or may bring her , a peck of trouble . There are , or there were , a certain lot of Spaniards -- Copperheads -- at home who look on her as a sort of embodiment of the American antagonism to their own nation . They are the low lot ; for mind you , though we are at war with them I say it , the good Spaniard is a fine fellow . It came to the ears of the authorities in Washington that there was some sort of plot on foot to do her a harm . The Secret Service was a little at fault , and could n't get accurate or full information ; for naturally enough the Spaniards did n't trust any but themselves in such a matter . We know enough , however , to be somewhat concerned for her ; and it was arranged that a secret watch should be kept on her , so that no harm should come that could be prevented . The proper men had been detailed off for the work ; when to our surprise , and a little to our consternation , it turned out that the young lady had disappeared . We knew of course that her going was voluntary ; she had left word to that effect , so that there might not be any bother made about her . But the trouble was that she did not know of the danger which threatened her ; and as our people did n't know where she was , no step could be taken to protect or warn her . It is clear that my lady got tired of fireworks and of the Joan of Arc business , and bolted . It was considered necessary at headquarters that we should in the meantime all keep our heads shut . But we were advised at the Embassy in London that the plot was on , and that we should hump ourselves a bit to look after her in case she was in England . The matter was handed over to me , and I have been on the run ever since ; but I have not been able to hear tale or tiding of her . Two days ago we got a cable in our cipher which told us that , from information received and the rest of it , they suspected she was in England , or probably in Scotland ; and that there was later evidence that the plot was more active than ever . Unfortunately we have as yet no details , and not even a clue . That is why I am here . I came down with Cathcart , who fortunately was bound for the North , as it covered up my purpose . I have been in a regular stew for days past . Marjory Drake is too good to have any trouble come to her that any American can help . You can imagine my delight when I saw her this evening ; for now that I have located her , I can take steps to look after her safety if necessary . You two went so fast on your wheels that I lost you at the Bridge ; but I surmised that you would be coming here anyhow after your ride . So I came up as quickly as I could , and saw you two and the old lady come up from the railway station . I could n't get to see Miss Drake to-night ; but I expect to look her up pretty early in the morning . '' Here was a new entanglement . It seemed to me as more than likely that Marjory , having seen Adams and knowing his diplomatic position , suspected some interference with her liberty , and made an escape at once . This , then , was the reason why she had asked me to stay and eat dinner alone ; I was to cover up her tracks and secure her a night's delay . Thus , even to Adams , my tongue was tied as to her movements . I did not wish to seem to deceive him , so avoided the subject . In answer to him I asked : '' But tell me , old fellow , how and where do I come into your story ? Why do you tell me this ? '' He answered very gravely : '' Because I want your help . This is , or rather may be , a very serious matter to Miss Drake . The whole business is entrusted by our government to my chief , who has detailed me on the service . It is of so delicate and secret a nature that I can not make confidence with many people , and I am loth to trust any one but a gentleman . Besides Miss Drake is a very peculiar girl . She is absolutely independent , thoroughly determined , and more than plucky . If she knew there was a plot on foot , as likely as not she would try to encourage it out of mere recklessness ; and would try to counterplot all by herself . Her enemies know this , and will avail themselves of every chance and of every false move of hers ; so that she might help to work out herself the evil intended for her . This we can not permit ; and I am quite sure that you , who are a friend of hers , are at one with me here . Now , if you want to know exactly how you can help I will tell you ; and you will , I am sure , pardon me if I say too much -- or too little . If she were to know that the matter of her protection was a Government one , nothing on earth would make her yield herself to our views . But if it were suggested by a -- a friend whom she -- she valued , her action would probably be quite the opposite . She is a girl all heart and soul . When she is taken rightly you can lead her with a thread ; but you ca n't drag her with gun-ropes . From what I saw yesterday , I am inclined to think that you might have more influence with her than any one else I could pick out . '' I could not say anything to this , either positive or negative , so I remained silent . He went on : '' There is one other reason why I ask you to help , but it is secondary to the other one , believe me , and one I only use to fortify a better one . I ask you as an old friend to help me in a matter which , even if you are not concerned in it , may be of the utmost importance to me in my diplomatic career . This matter has been placed in my hands , and it would not do for me to fail . There is not much κυδος to be got out of it if all be well -- except with my immediate chiefs ; but if I failed it would go far against me . If Marjory Drake should suffer from this Spanish plot , she who had , so to speak , fired the torch of the nation in the war , it would be formal , official ruin to me . There would n't be a man from Maine to California , from the Lakes to the Gulf , who would n't look on me as an imbecile , or worse ! '' Whilst he was speaking I was thinking , and trying to make up my mind as to what I should do . Manifestly , I could not tell him of the dawning relations between Marjory and myself . I was not yet prepared to speak of the Pope 's treasure . I could not in honour give away Marjory 's confidence in me in asking me to cover up her escape , or the implied promise of my acceptance of it . Still , Adams's confidence required some measure of frankness from me . His last appeal to me as an old friend to help him as an individual in an important work , which might mar if it could not make him , demanded that I should stretch every point I could in his favour . So I said : '' Sam , I shall do all I honestly or honourably can . But I must ask you to wait a while and trust me . The fact is I am not at liberty just at present to turn any way I choose . I am already committed to certain confidences , which were made before I saw you or had any knowledge of what you tell me . Moreover , I am in certain ways ignorant in matters that you would not expect . I shall at once take every step I can to be in a position to speak to you more freely . I am more deeply stirred , old fellow , by what you have told me than I can say ; and out of the depths of my heart I am grateful to you and your Government for your care for Miss Anita -- Miss Drake . I may say this , that until to-morrow at all events , I am unable to help you in any possible way . Were I to try to do anything till a certain thing happens , it would hinder rather than help your purpose . So wait patiently and do please try to understand me . '' He replied with unwonted sarcasm : '' Try to understand you ! Why man alive I 've been trying whilst you were speaking , until my brain reels . But I 'm blamed if I can make head or tail of what you say . You seem to be snarled up in more knots than a conjuror . What the hell does it all mean ? You do n't seem to be able to turn anywhere or do anything , even when the safety or the life of such a girl as Marjory Drake is in question . On my faith Mr. Hunter I hope I do n't make any mistake about you ! '' `` Yes , you do , Sam ! '' I said quietly , for I could not but feel that he had good cause for disappointment or even anger . `` At the first moment I am free to do so , I shall tell you all I can ; and you shall then see that I am only doing what you would under similar circumstances do yourself . Wo n't you trust me , old friend ! '' He gazed at me steadily for a few seconds , and then his look softened . `` By God I will ! '' he said , as he held out his hand . `` Now tell me , '' I said `` what can I do to keep in touch with you . I must go back to Cruden in the morning . It is necessary . '' This was in answer to his questioning look . `` It is the first step in my doing as you wish . '' I knew that Marjory would send to me , if at all , to Cruden . `` But tell me how or where I can wire you in case we are not within hail . '' For answer he pulled out of his pocket a bundle of `` priority '' telegrams addressed to the United States Embassy in London . `` Take them and use them as may be required . I am in constant touch with the Embassy and they will know where to find me . How will I find you ? '' `` Send to me care of Post-office , Cruden Bay , '' I said , `` I shall keep you advised of wherever I may be . '' With that we said good night . `` I shall see you in the morning , '' he said as he went out . CHAPTER XVIII FIREWORKS AND JOAN OF ARC For some time I did not sleep . Things were hurrying on so fast ; and so many new events and facts and dangers were coming to light , that I hardly knew where to begin to think . Of course all things concerning Marjory , principally her safety , took the first place . What could be this Spanish plot ; what could be its method or its purpose ? At first when Adams had told me of it , I had not been much concerned ; it seemed so far away , so improbable , that I fear I did not take it with sufficient gravity . I had not thought at the time that the two nations were actually at war , and that already , both before the war and during it , deeds of desperate treachery had been done , the memory of which were not even obliterated by the valour and chivalry which had been shown by the nobler of America 's foes . `` _Remember The Maine_ '' was still a watchword and war cry . There were many scoundrels , such as chiefly come to the surface in war time , who would undertake any work , however deadly , however brutal , however dangerous . Such villains might be at work even now ! With a bound I was out upon the floor . In that moment of concrete thought of danger to Marjory I realised to the full the danger of my own ignorance of her situation , and even of the locality where she might be . This impotence to do anything was simply maddening ; when I felt it I could not but understand the annoyance of Adams in feeling a measure of the same impotence , with what looked like my obstinacy added . But think how I would , I could do nothing till I should see Marjory or hear from her . With this thought , which , under the circumstances , was more than harrowing , I went back to bed . I was waked by the knocking of Adams who in reply to my `` Come , '' slipped in and shut the door behind him . `` They are gone ! '' `` Who ? '' I asked mechanically , though I well knew . `` Miss Drake and her friend . They went away last night , just after you came back from the station . By the way , I thought you dined with them ? '' he said interrogatively , and with a dash of suspicion in his tone . `` I was to dine with them ; '' I answered `` but they were not there . '' He made a long pause . `` I do n't understand ! '' he said . I felt that as the time which I was to cover had passed , I might speak ; for all sakes I wanted to avoid collision with Adams or the appearance of deceiving him . So I said : '' I can tell you now , Sam . I was asked to dine last night with Mrs. Jack and Miss Anita -- Miss Drake . When I came down to the room I found a letter saying that they had to go away and making a special request that I would dine alone , just as though they were there . I was not to say a word to any one about their being away . Please understand , my dear fellow -- and I must ask you to take it that this is only a hint which you must accept and not attempt to follow up -- that there are reasons why I should act on any request of Miss Drake 's , blindfold . I told you last night that my hands were tied ; this was one of the cords . To-day I hold myself free to explain I may now also tell you more . Last night I could do nothing . I could take no step myself , nor could I help you to take one ; simply for the reason that I do not know where Miss Drake is staying . She is I know stopping , or was till lately , somewhere on the eastern side of Aberdeen County ; but where the place is I have not the faintest idea . I expect to know very shortly ; and the moment I know I will try to inform you , unless I am forbidden . You will know in time that I have spoken exact truth ; though you may have found my words or meaning hard to understand . I am more than anxious to put Marjory on guard . When you left me last night , the whole deadly seriousness of the matter grew on me , till I was as miserable as a man can be . '' His face lightened as I spoke . `` Well , '' he said `` at least we are one in the matter ; that is something . I feared you were , and would be , working against me . Now look here , I have been thinking the matter over , and I daresay I have come nearer to understanding your position than you imagine . I do n't want to limit or hamper you in working in your own way for Miss Drake 's good ; but I may tell you this . I mean to find her if I can , and in my own way . I am not fettered anywhere , except by the necessary secrecy . Outside of this I am free to act . I shall keep you advised at Cruden . '' Before I was dressed I had another visitor . This time it was Cathcart who , with considerable diffidence and all the shamefaced embarrassment of an Englishman when doing a kindly action in which he may be taken as intruding , offered me his services . I tried to set him at ease by the heartiness of my thanks . Upon which he expanded enough to say : '' From something Adams let drop -- in all confidence believe me -- I gather you are or may be in trouble about some friend . If this should be , and from my heart I trust it may not , I hope you will bear in mind that I am a friend , and unattached . I am pretty well alone in the world so far as family is concerned , and there is no one to interfere with me . Indeed there are some who would be happy , for testamentary reasons , to attend my funeral . I hope you will remember this , old chap , if there is any fun going . '' Then he went away , easy of carriage and debonair as usual . It was in such wise that this gallant gentleman made me a proffer of his life . It moved me more than I can tell . I went down to Cruden by the next train , and arranged with the postmaster to send on to me at once by messenger or wire any telegram that might come directed as I had told Adams . Towards dusk a letter was brought to me . It was in Marjory 's hand , and on my asking at once how it had come , I was told that it was brought by a mounted man who on handing it in had said `` no answer '' and had ridden away . With hope and joy and misgiving mingled I opened it . All these feelings were justified by the few words it contained : '' Meet me to-morrow at eleven at Pircappies . '' I passed the night with what patience I could , and rose early . At ten I took a light boat and rowed by myself from Port Erroll across the bay . I hung round outside the Skares , ostensibly fishing but keeping watch for any sign of Marjory ; for from this point I could see the road to Whinnyfold and the path by the beach . A little before eleven I saw a woman wheeling a bicycle down the Whinnyfold laneway . Taking in my lines , I pulled , quietly and avoiding any appearance of hurry , for I knew not whether any one might see us , into the tiny harbour behind the jutting rock . Marjory arrived just at the same time , and I rejoiced to see that her face bore no mark or sign of care . As yet nothing had happened . We met with a slight hand shake ; but there was a look in her eyes which made my heart leap . For the past thirty-six hours my anxiety for her had put aside every other feeling . I had not thought of myself , and therefore not of my love for her ; but now my selfish instinct woke again in full force . In her presence , and in the jubilance of my own heart , fear in all forms seemed as impossible to realise as that the burning sun above us should be blotted out with falling snow . With one of her mysterious signs of silence she pointed to the rock that here stretches out into the sea , and whose top is crowned with long sea grass . Together we climbed the face of the cliff , and bearing across the narrow promontory passed over the top of the rock . We found a cosy nest hidden behind it . Here we were absolutely isolated from the world ; out of earshot of every one , and out of sight except from beyond the stretch of rocky sea . In a demure way she acknowledged my satisfaction . `` Is n't it a nice place . I chose it out yesterday when I was here ! '' For an instant I felt as though she had struck me . Just to think that she had been here yesterday , whilst I was waiting for her only across the bay , eating my heart out . However , there was no use looking back . She was with me now , and we were alone . The whole delight of the thing swept away every other feeling . With a pretty little motion of settling herself comfortably , and which to me seemed to prelude a long talk , she began : '' I suppose you know a lot about me now ? '' `` How do you mean ? '' `` Come now , do n't prevaricate . I saw Sam Adams in Aberdeen , and of course he told you all about me . '' I interrupted : '' No he did n't . '' The very tone of my voice enlightened her . With a smile she said : '' Then some one else did . Answer me some questions . What is my name ? '' `` Marjory Anita Drake . '' `` Am I poor ? '' `` In the way of money , no . '' `` Right ! Why did I leave America ? '' `` To run away from the fireworks and the Joan of Arc business . '' `` Right again ; but that sounds mighty like Sam Adams . Well , that 's all right ; now we may begin . I want to tell you something which you don't know . '' She paused . Half in delight and half in fear , for her appearance of purpose alarmed me , I set myself to listen . CHAPTER XIX ON CHANGING ONE 'S NAME With a smile Marjory began : '' You are satisfied that it was because of the fireworks and Joan of Arc business that I came away ? '' `` Oh yes ! '' `` And that this was the final and determining cause ? '' `` Why certainly ! '' `` Then you are wrong ! '' I looked at her in wonder and in some secret concern . If I were wrong in this belief , then why not in others ? If Adams 's belief and my acceptance of it were erroneous , what new mystery was there to be revealed ? Just at present things had been looking so well for the accomplishment of my wishes that any disturbance must be unwelcome . Marjory , watching me from under her eyelashes , had by this time summed me up . The stern look which she always had when her brows were fixed in thought , melted into a smile which was partly happy , partly mischievous , and wholly girlish . `` Make your mind easy , Archie '' she said , and oh ! how my heart leaped when she addressed me by my Christian name for the first time . `` There isn't anything to get uneasy about . I 'll tell you what it was if you wish . '' `` Certainly I wish , if you do n't dislike telling me . '' So she went on : '' I did not mind the fireworks ; that is I did mind them and liked them too . Between you and me , there has to be a lot of fireworks for one to object to them . People may say what they please , but it 's only those who have not tasted popular favour that say they do n't like it . I do n't know how Joan of Arc felt , but I 've a pretty cute idea that she was like other girls . If she enjoyed being cheered and made much of as well as I did , no wonder that she kept up the game as long as she could . What broke me all up was the proposals of marriage ! It 's all very well getting proposed to by people you know , and that you do n't dislike . But when you get a washing basket full of proposals every morning by the post ; when seedy looking scallywags ogle you ; when smug young men with soft hats and no chins wait outside your door to hand you their own poems ; and when greasy cranks stop your carriage to proffer their hearts to you before your servants , it becomes too much . Of course you can burn the letters , though there are some of them too good and too honest not to treat their writers with respect . But the cranks and egotists , and scallywags and publicans and sinners , the loafers that float round one like an unwholesome miasma ; these are too many and too various , and too awful to cope with . I felt the conviction so driven in to me that the girl , or at any rate her personality , counts for so little , but that her money , or her notoriety , or celebrity or whatever it is , counts for so much , that I could n't bear to meet strangers at all . Burglars and ghosts and tigers and snakes and all kinds of things that dart out on you are bad enough ; but I tell you that proposers on the pounce are a holy terror . Why , at last I began to distrust everyone . There was n't an unmarried man of my acquaintance that I did n't begin to suspect of some design ; and then the funny part of it was that if they did n't come up to the scratch I felt aggrieved . It was awfully unfair was n't it ? But I could not help it . I wonder if there is a sort of moral jaundice which makes one see colours all wrong ! If there is , I had it ; and so I just came away to get cured if I could . `` You ca n't imagine the freedom which it was to me not to be made much of and run after . Of course there was a disappointing side to it ; I 'm afraid people 's heads swell very quick ! But , all told , it was delightful . Mrs. Jack had come with me , and I had covered up my tracks at home so that no one would be worried . We ran up to Canada , and at Montreal took a steamer to Liverpool . We got out , however , at Moville . We had given false names , so that we could n't be tracked . '' Here she stopped ; and a shy look grew over her face . I waited , for I thought it would embarrass her less to tell things in her own way than to be asked questions . The shy look grew into a rosy blush , through which came that divine truth which now and again can shine from a girl 's eyes . She said in quite a different way from any in which she had spoken to me as yet ; with a gentle appealing gravity : '' That was why I let you keep the wrong impression as to my name . I could n't bear that you , who had been so good to me , should , at the very start of our -- our friendship , find me out in a piece of falsity . And then when we knew each other better , and after you had treated me with so much confidence about the Second Sight and Gormala and the Treasure , it made me feel so guilty every time I thought of it that I was ashamed to speak . '' She stopped and I ventured to take her hand . I said in as consolatory a way as I could : '' But my dear , that was not any deceit -- to me at any rate . You took another name to avoid trouble before ever I even saw you ; how then could I be aggrieved . Besides '' I added , feeling bolder as she did not make any effort to draw away her hand , `` I should be the last person in the world to object to your changing your name ! '' `` Why ? '' she asked raising her eyes to mine with a glance which shot through me . This was pure coquetry ; she knew just as well as I did what I meant . All the same , however , I said : '' Because I too want you to change it ! '' She did not say a word , but looked down . I was now sure of my ground , and without a word I bent over and kissed her . She did not draw back . Her arms went round me ; and in an instant I had a glimpse of heaven . Presently she put me away gently and said : '' There was another reason why I did not speak all that time . I can tell it to you now . '' `` Pardon me '' I interrupted `` but before you tell me , am I to take it that -- well , what has just been between us -- is an affirmative answer to my question ? '' Her teeth flashed as well as her eyes as she answered : '' Have you any doubt ? Was there any imperfection in the answer ? If so , perhaps we had better read it as 'no . ' '' My answer was not verbal ; but it was satisfactory to me . Then she went on : '' I can surely tell you now at all events . Have you still doubts ? '' `` Yes '' said I , `` many , very many , hundreds , thousands , millions , all of which are clamouring for instant satisfaction ! '' She said quietly and very demurely , at the same time raising that warning hand which I already well knew , and which I could not but feel was apt to have an influence on my life , though I had no doubt but that it would always be for good : '' Then as there are so many , there is not the slightest use trying to deal with them now . '' `` All right '' I said `` we shall take them in proper season and deal with them seriatim . '' She said nothing , but she looked happy . I felt so happy myself that the very air round us , and the sunshine , and the sea , seemed full of joyous song . There was music even in the screaming of the myriad seagulls sweeping overhead , and in the wash of the rising and falling waves at our feet .

Opposite to me , across the road and standing under the only little clump of trees in the place was a tall , gaunt old woman , who kept looking at me intently . As I sat , a little group , consisting of a man and two women , went by . I found my eyes follow them , for it seemed to me after they had passed me that the two women walked together and the man alone in front carrying on his shoulder a little black box -- a coffin . I shuddered as I thought , but a moment later I saw all three abreast just as they had been . The old woman was now looking at me with eyes that blazed . She came across the road and said to me without preface : '' What saw ye then , that yer e'en looked so awed ? '' I did not like to tell her so I did not answer . Her great eyes were fixed keenly upon me , seeming to look me through and through . I felt that I grew quite red , whereupon she said , apparently to herself : `` I thocht so ! Even I did not see that which he saw . '' `` How do you mean ? '' I queried . She answered ambiguously : `` Wait ! Ye shall perhaps know before this hour to-morrow ! '' Her answer interested me and I tried to get her to say more ; but she would not . She moved away with a grand stately movement that seemed to become her great gaunt form . After dinner whilst I was sitting in front of the hotel , there was a great commotion in the village ; much running to and fro of men and women with sad mien . On questioning them I found that a child had been drowned in the little harbour below . Just then a woman and a man , the same that had passed the bridge earlier in the day , ran by with wild looks . One of the bystanders looked after them pityingly as he said : '' Puir souls . It 's a sad home-comin ' for them the nicht . '' `` Who are they ? '' I asked . The man took off his cap reverently as he answered : '' The father and mother of the child that was drowned ! '' As he spoke I looked round as though some one had called me . There stood the gaunt woman with a look of triumph on her face . * * * * * The curved shore of Cruden Bay , Aberdeenshire , is backed by a waste of sandhills in whose hollows seagrass and moss and wild violets , together with the pretty `` grass of Parnassus '' form a green carpet . The surface of the hills is held together by bent-grass and is eternally shifting as the wind takes the fine sand and drifts it to and fro . All behind is green , from the meadows that mark the southern edge of the bay to the swelling uplands that stretch away and away far in the distance , till the blue mist of the mountains at Braemar sets a kind of barrier . In the centre of the bay the highest point of the land that runs downward to the sea looks like a miniature hill known as the Hawklaw ; from this point onward to the extreme south , the land runs high with a gentle trend downwards . Cruden sands are wide and firm and the sea runs out a considerable distance . When there is a storm with the wind on shore the whole bay is a mass of leaping waves and broken water that threatens every instant to annihilate the stake-nets which stretch out here and there along the shore . More than a few vessels have been lost on these wide stretching sands , and it was perhaps the roaring of the shallow seas and the terror which they inspired which sent the crews to the spirit room and the bodies of those of them which came to shore later on , to the churchyard on the hill . If Cruden Bay is to be taken figuratively as a mouth , with the sand hills for soft palate , and the green Hawklaw as the tongue , the rocks which work the extremities are its teeth . To the north the rocks of red granite rise jagged and broken . To the south , a mile and a half away as the crow flies , Nature seems to have manifested its wildest forces . It is here , where the little promontory called Whinnyfold juts out , that the two great geological features of the Aberdeen coast meet . The red sienite of the north joins the black gneiss of the south . That union must have been originally a wild one ; there are evidences of an upheaval which must have shaken the earth to its centre . Here and there are great masses of either species of rock hurled upwards in every conceivable variety of form , sometimes fused or pressed together so that it is impossible to say exactly where gneiss ends or sienite begins ; but broadly speaking here is an irregular line of separation . This line runs seawards to the east and its strength is shown in its outcrop . For half a mile or more the rocks rise through the sea singly or in broken masses ending in a dangerous cluster known as `` The Skares '' and which has had for centuries its full toll of wreck and disaster . Did the sea hold its dead where they fell , its floor around the Skares would be whitened with their bones , and new islands could build themselves with the piling wreckage . At times one may see here the ocean in her fiercest mood ; for it is when the tempest drives from the south-east that the sea is fretted amongst the rugged rocks and sends its spume landwards . The rocks that at calmer times rise dark from the briny deep are lost to sight for moments in the grand onrush of the waves . The seagulls which usually whiten them , now flutter around screaming , and the sound of their shrieks comes in on the gale almost in a continuous note , for the single cries are merged in the multitudinous roar of sea and air . The village , squatted beside the emboucher of the Water of Cruden at the northern side of the bay is simple enough ; a few rows of fishermen's cottages , two or three great red-tiled drying-sheds nestled in the sand-heap behind the fishers ' houses . For the rest of the place as it was when first I saw it , a little lookout beside a tall flagstaff on the northern cliff , a few scattered farms over the inland prospect , one little hotel down on the western bank of the Water of Cruden with a fringe of willows protecting its sunk garden which was always full of fruits and flowers . From the most southern part of the beach of Cruden Bay to Whinnyfold village the distance is but a few hundred yards ; first a steep pull up the face of the rock ; and then an even way , beside part of which runs a tiny stream . To the left of this path , going towards Whinnyfold , the ground rises in a bold slope and then falls again all round , forming a sort of wide miniature hill of some eighteen or twenty acres . Of this the southern side is sheer , the black rock dipping into the waters of the little bay of Whinnyfold , in the centre of which is a picturesque island of rock shelving steeply from the water on the northern side , as is the tendency of all the gneiss and granite in this part . But to east and north there are irregular bays or openings , so that the furthest points of the promontory stretch out like fingers . At the tips of these are reefs of sunken rock falling down to deep water and whose existence can only be suspected in bad weather when the rush of the current beneath sends up swirling eddies or curling masses of foam . These little bays are mostly curved and are green where falling earth or drifting sand have hidden the outmost side of the rocks and given a foothold to the seagrass and clover . Here have been at some time or other great caves , now either fallen in or silted up with sand , or obliterated with the earth brought down in the rush of surface-water in times of long rain . In one of these bays , Broad Haven , facing right out to the Skares , stands an isolated pillar of rock called locally the `` Puir mon '' through whose base , time and weather have worn a hole through which one may walk dryshod . Through the masses of rocks that run down to the sea from the sides and shores of all these bays are here and there natural channels with straight edges as though cut on purpose for the taking in of the cobbles belonging to the fisher folk of Whinnyfold . When first I saw the place I fell in love with it . Had it been possible I should have spent my summer there , in a house of my own , but the want of any place in which to live forbade such an opportunity . So I stayed in the little hotel , the Kilmarnock Arms . The next year I came again , and the next , and the next . And then I arranged to take a feu at Whinnyfold and to build a house overlooking the Skares for myself . The details of this kept me constantly going to Whinnyfold , and my house to be was always in my thoughts . Hitherto my life had been an uneventful one . At school I was , though secretly ambitious , dull as to results . At College I was better off , for my big body and athletic powers gave me a certain position in which I had to overcome my natural shyness . When I was about eight and twenty I found myself nominally a barrister , with no knowledge whatever of the practice of law and but little less of the theory , and with a commission in the Devil 's Own -- the irreverent name given to the Inns of Court Volunteers . I had few relatives , but a comfortable , though not great , fortune ; and I had been round the world , dilettante fashion . CHAPTER II GORMALA All that night I thought of the dead child and of the peculiar vision which had come to me . Sleeping or waking it was all the same ; my mind could not leave the parents in procession as seen in imagination , or their distracted mien in reality . Mingled with them was the great-eyed , aquiline-featured , gaunt old woman who had taken such an interest in the affair , and in my part of it . I asked the landlord if he knew her , since , from his position as postmaster he knew almost everyone for miles around . He told me that she was a stranger to the place . Then he added : '' I ca n't imagine what brings her here . She has come over from Peterhead two or three times lately ; but she does n't seem to have anything at all to do . She has nothing to sell and she buys nothing . She 's not a tripper , and she 's not a beggar , and she 's not a thief , and she 's not a worker of any sort . She 's a queer-looking lot anyhow . I fancy from her speech that she 's from the west ; probably from some of the far-out islands . I can tell that she has the Gaelic from the way she speaks . '' Later on in the day , when I was walking on the shore near the Hawklaw , she came up to speak to me . The shore was quite lonely , for in those days it was rare to see anyone on the beach except when the salmon fishers drew their nets at the ebbing tide . I was walking towards Whinnyfold when she came upon me silently from behind . She must have been hidden among the bent-grass of the sandhills for had she been anywhere in view I must have seen her on that desolate shore . She was evidently a most imperious person ; she at once addressed me in a tone and manner which made me feel as though I were in some way an inferior , and in somehow to blame : '' What for did ye no tell me what ye saw yesterday ? '' Instinctively I answered : '' I do n't know why . Perhaps because it seemed so ridiculous . '' Her stern features hardened into scorn as she replied : '' Are Death and the Doom then so redeekulous that they pleasure ye intil silence ? '' I somehow felt that this was a little too much and was about to make a sharp answer , when suddenly it struck me as a remarkable thing that she knew already . Filled with surprise I straightway asked her : '' Why , how on earth do you know ? I told no one . '' I stopped for I felt all at sea ; there was some mystery here which I could not fathom . She seemed to read my mind like an open book , for she went on looking at me as she spoke , searchingly and with an odd smile . `` Eh ! laddie , do ye no ken that ye hae een that can see ? Do ye no understand that ye hae een that can speak ? Is it that one with the Gift o ' Second Sight has no an understandin ' o ' it . Why , yer face when ye saw the mark o ' the Doom , was like a printed book to een like mine . '' `` Do you mean to tell me '' I asked `` that you could tell what I saw , simply by looking at my face ? '' `` Na ! na ! laddie . Not all that , though a Seer am I ; but I knew that you had seen the Doom ! It 's no that varied that there need be any mistake . After all Death is only one , in whatever way we may speak ! '' After a pause of thought I asked her : '' If you have the power of Second Sight why did you not see the vision , or whatever it was , yourself ? '' `` Eh ! laddie '' she answered , shaking her head `` 'T is little ye ken o' the wark o ' the Fates ! Learn ye then that the Voice speaks only as it listeth into chosen ears , and the Vision comes only to chosen een . None can will to hear or to see , to pleasure themselves . '' `` Then '' I said , and I felt that there was a measure of triumph in my tone '' if to none but the chosen is given to know , how comes it that you , who seem not to have been chosen on this occasion at all events , know all the same ? '' She answered with a touch of impatience : '' Do ye ken , young sir , that even mortal een have power to see much , if there be behind them the thocht , an ' the knowledge and the experience to guide them aright . How , think ye , is it that some can see much , and learn much as they gang ; while others go blind as the mowdiwart , at the end o ' the journey as before it ? '' `` Then perhaps you will tell me how much you saw , and how you saw it ? '' `` Ah ! to them that have seen the Doom there needs but sma ' guidance to their thochts . Too lang , an ' too often hae I mysen seen the death-sark an ' the watch-candle an ' the dead-hole , not to know when they are seen tae ither een . Na , na ! laddie , what I kent o ' yer seein ' was no by the Gift but only by the use o ' my proper een . I kent not the muckle o ' what ye saw . Not whether it was ane or ither o ' the garnishins o ' the dead ; but weel I kent that it was o ' death . '' `` Then , '' I said interrogatively `` Second Sight is altogether a matter of chance ? '' `` Chance ! chance ! '' she repeated with scorn . `` Na ! young sir ; when the Voice has spoken there is no more chance than that the nicht will follow the day . '' `` You mistake me , '' I said , feeling somewhat superior now that I had caught her in an error , `` I did not for a moment mean that the Doom -- whatever it is -- is not a true forerunner . What I meant was that it seems to be a matter of chance in whose ear the Voice -- whatever it is -- speaks ; when once it has been ordained that it is to sound in the ear of some one . '' Again she answered with scorn : '' Na , na ! there is no chance o ' ocht aboot the Doom . Them that send forth the Voice and the Seein ' know well to whom it is sent and why . Can ye no comprehend that it is for no bairn-play that such goes forth . When the Voice speaks , it is mainly followed by tears an ' woe an ' lamentation ! Nae ! nor is it only one bit manifestation that stands by its lanes , remote and isolate from all ither . Truly 't is but a pairt o ' the great scheme o ' things ; an ' be sure that whoso is chosen to see or to hear is chosen weel , an ' must hae their pairt in what is to be , on to the verra end . '' `` Am I to take it '' I asked , `` that Second Sight is but a little bit of some great purpose which has to be wrought out by means of many kinds ; and that whoso sees the Vision or hears the Voice is but the blind unconscious instrument of Fate ? '' `` Aye ! laddie . Weel eneuch the Fates know their wishes an ' their wark , no to need the help or the thocht of any human -- blind or seein ' , sane or silly , conscious or unconscious . '' All through her speaking I had been struck by the old woman 's use of the word 'Fate , ' and more especially when she used it in the plural . It was evident that , Christian though she might be -- and in the West they are generally devout observants of the duties of their creed -- her belief in this respect came from some of the old pagan mythologies . I should have liked to question her on this point ; but I feared to shut her lips against me . Instead I asked her : '' Tell me , will you , if you do n't mind , of some case you have known yourself of Second Sight ? '' `` 'T is no for them to brag or boast to whom has been given to see the wark o ' the hand o ' Fate . But sine ye are yerself a Seer an ' would learn , then I may speak . I hae seen the sea ruffle wi'oot cause in the verra spot where later a boat was to gang doon , I hae heard on a lone moor the hammerin ' o ' the coffin-wright when one passed me who was soon to dee . I hae seen the death-sark fold round the speerit o ' a drowned one , in baith ma sleepin ' an ' ma wakin ' dreams . I hae heard the settin' doom o ' the Spaiks , an ' I hae seen the Weepers on a ' the crood that walked . Aye , an ' in mony anither way hae I seen an ' heard the Coming o' the Doom . '' `` But did all the seeings and hearings come true ? '' I asked . `` Did it ever happen that you heard queer sounds or saw strange sights and that yet nothing came of them ? I gather that you do not always know to whom something is going to happen ; but only that death is coming to some one ! '' She was not displeased at my questioning but replied at once : '' Na doot ! but there are times when what is seen or heard has no manifest following . But think ye , young sir , how mony a corp , still waited for , lies in the depths o ' the sea ; how mony lie oot on the hillsides , or are fallen in deep places where their bones whiten unkent . Nay ! more , to how many has Death come in a way that men think the wark o ' nature when his hastening has come frae the hand of man , untold . '' This was a difficult matter to answer so I changed or rather varied the subject . `` How long must elapse before the warning comes true ? '' `` Ye know yersel ' , for but yestreen ye hae seen , how the Death can follow hard upon the Doom ; but there be times , nay mostly are they so , when days or weeks pass away ere the Doom is fulfilled . '' `` Is this so ? '' I asked `` when you know the person regarding whom the Doom is spoken . '' She answered with an air of certainty which somehow carried conviction , secretly , with it . `` Even so ! I know one who walks the airth now in all the pride o ' his strength . But the Doom has been spoken of him . I saw him with these verra een lie prone on rocks , wi ' the water rinnin ' down from his hair . An ' again I heard the minute bells as he went by me on a road where is no bell for a score o ' miles . Aye , an ' yet again I saw him in the kirk itsel ' wi ' corbies flyin ' round him , an ' mair gatherin ' from afar ! '' Here was indeed a case where Second Sight might be tested ; so I asked her at once , though to do so I had to overcome a strange sort of repugnance : '' Could this be proved ? Would it not be a splendid case to make known ; so that if the death happened it would prove beyond all doubt the existence of such a thing as Second Sight . '' My suggestion was not well received . She answered with slow scorn : '' Beyon ' all doot ! Doot ! Wha is there that doots the bein ' o ' the Doom ? Learn ye too , young sir , that the Doom an ' all thereby is no for traffickin ' wi ' them that only cares for curiosity and publeecity . The Voice and the Vision o ' the Seer is no for fine madams and idle gentles to while away their time in play-toy make-believe ! '' I climbed down at once . `` Pardon me ! '' I said `` I spoke without thinking . I should not have said so -- to you at any rate . '' She accepted my apology with a sort of regal inclination ; but the moment after she showed by her words she was after all but a woman ! `` I will tell ye ; that so in the full time ye may hae no doot yersel ' . For ye are a Seer and as Them that has the power hae gien ye the Gift it is no for the like o ' me to cumber the road o ' their doin ' . Know ye then , and remember weel , how it was told ye by Gormala MacNiel that Lauchlane Macleod o ' the Outer Isles hae been Called ; tho ' as yet the Voice has no sounded in his ears but only in mine . But ye will see the time -- -- '' She stopped suddenly as though some thought had struck her , and then went on impressively : '' When I saw him lie prone on the rocks there was ane that bent ower him that I kent not in the nicht wha it was , though the licht o ' the moon was around him . We shall see ! We shall see ! '' Without a word more\""
