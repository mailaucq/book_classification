cj01,cj01,informative,learned,2189,introduction it have recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planet a a new source of information about these body and their atmosphere the result of present observation of the thermal radio emission of the moon be consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which be derive from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipse e g garstung when sufficiently accurate and complete measurement be available it will be possible to set limit on the thermal and electrical characteristic of the surface and subsurface material of the moon observation of the radio emission of a planet which have an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a great extent than those use short wave length and should in some case give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristic of the solid surface radio observation of venus and jupiter have already supply unexpected experimental data on the physical condition of these planet the observe intensity of the radio emission of venus be much high than the expect thermal intensity although the spectrum indicate by measurement at wave length near cm and cm be like that of a black body at about degree this result suggest a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there be the possibility that the observe radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal component and that the observe spectrum be that of a black body merely by coincidence for the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum be definitely not like the spectrum of a black body radiator and it seem very likely that the radiation reach the earth be a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal component of the remain planet only mar and saturn have be observe a radio source and not very much information be available mar have be observe twice at about cm wave length and the intensity of the observe radiation be in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predict on the basis of the know temperature of mar the low intensity of the radiation from saturn have limit observation but again the measure radiation seem to be consistent with a thermal origin no attempt to measure the radio emission of the remain planet have be report and because of their distance small diameter or low temperature the thermal radiation at radio wave length reach the earth from these source be expect to be of very low intensity in spite of this the very large radio reflector and improve amplify technique which be now become available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planet in a few year the study of the radio emission of the moon and planet begin with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at cm wave length by dicke and beringer this be follow by a comprehensive series of observation of the cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycle by piddington and minnett they deduce from their measurement that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon vary during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion that the amplitude of the variation be considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission a measure by pettit and nicholson and pettit and that the maximum of the radio emission come about day after full moon which be again in contrast to the infrared emission which reach it maximum at full moon piddington and minnett explain their observation by point out that rocklike material which be likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio wave although opaque to infrared radiation the infrared emission could then be assume to originate at the surface of the moon while the radio emission originate at some depth beneath the surface where the temperature variation due to solar radiation be reduce in amplitude and shift in phase since the absorption of radio wave in rocklike material vary with wave length it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depth beneath the surface and possibly detect change in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material the radio emission of a planet be first detect in when burke and franklin identify the origin of interference like radio noise on their record at about meter wave length a emission from jupiter this sporadic type of planetary radiation be discuss by burke chap and gallet chap steady radiation which be presumably of thermal origin be observe from venus at and cm and from mar and jupiter at cm in mayer mccullough and sloanaker a b c and from saturn at cm in drake and ewen in the relatively short time since these early observation venus have be observe at additional wave length in the range from to cm and jupiter have be observe over the wave length range from to aj the observable characteristic of planetary radio radiation be the intensity the polarization and the direction of arrival of the wave the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk a observe from the earth be about minute of arc this be much small than the high resolution of even the very large reflector now under construction and consequently the radio emission of different region of the disk can not be resolve it should be possible however to put useful limit on the diameter of the radio source by observe with large reflector or with interferometer measurement of polarization be presently limit by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth there have be few measurement specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation the measurement make with the nrl foot reflector which be altitude azimuth mount would have show a systematic change with local hour angle in the measure intensity of venus and jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation have be linearly polarize recent interferometer measurement radhakrishnan and robert have show the mc emission of jupiter to be partially polarize and to originate in a region of large diameter than the visible disk other than this very significant result most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planet be restrict to the intensity of the radiation the concept of apparent black body temperature be use to describe the radiation receive from the moon and the planet the receive radiation be compare with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtend the same solid angle a the visible disk of the planet the apparent black body disk temperature be the temperature which must be assume for the black body in order that the intensity of it radiation should equal that of the observe radiation the use of this concept do not specify the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiate a a black body will the apparent black body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emit material the radio radiation of the sun which be reflect from the moon and planet should be negligible compare with their thermal emission at centimeter wave length except possibly at time of exceptional outburst of solar radio noise the quiescent level of centimeter wave length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than degree at meter wave length an increase of the order of degree in the average disk temperature of the near planet would be expect therefore neglect the extreme outburst reflect solar radiation be not expect to cause sizable error in the measurement of planetary radiation in the centimeter and decimeter wave length range the moon observation radio observation of the moon have be make over the range of wave length from mm to cm and the result be summarize in table observation have also be make at mm use optical technique sinton see also chap not all the observer have use the same procedure or make the same assumption about the lunar brightness distribution when reduce the data and this together with difference in the method of calibrate the antenna and receiver must account for much of the disagreement in the measure radio brightness temperature in the observation at mm coat the diameter of the antenna beam be small enough to allow resolution of some of the large feature of the lunar surface and contour diagram have be make of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phase these observation indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous region mare imbrium seem to be an exception and remain cooler than the region which surround it these contour diagram also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude very recently observation have be make at mm wave length with a reflector meter in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about amenitskii noskova and salomonovich the constant temperature contour be much smooth than those observe at mm by coat and apparently the emission at mm be not nearly so sensitive to difference in surface feature such high resolution observation a these be need at several wave length in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpret the observation of mayer mccullough and sloanaker at cm and of sloanaker at cm have not previously be publish and will be briefly describe measurement at cm be obtain on day spread over the interval may to june use the foot reflector at the u s naval research laboratory in washington the half intensity diameter of the antenna beam be about and the angle subtend by the moon include the entire main beam and part of the first side lobe the antenna pattern and the power gain at the peak of the beam be both measure mayer mccullough and sloanaker so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon be know the ratio of the measure antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam assume that the brightness temperature of the sky be negligible be find by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram to be the measure brightness temperature be a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon s disk be nearly uniform the result of the observation be af where the phase angle q be measure in degree from new moon and the probable error include absolute a well a relative error this result be plot along with the mm observation of gibson in figure a the variation in the cm emission of the moon during a lunation be very much less than the variation in the mm emission a would be expect from the explanation of piddington and minnett in the discussion which follow the time average of the radio emission will be refer to a the constant component and the superimpose periodic variation will be call the variable component the cm observation of sloanaker be make on may use the foot reflector at the maryland point observatory of the u s naval research laboratory the age of the moon be about day the half intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna be about and the brightness temperature be reduce by assume a gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon
cj02,cj02,informative,learned,2182,abstract experiment be make on an electric arc apply a porous graphite anode cool by a transpire gas argon thus the energy transfer from the arc to the anode be partly feed back into the arc it be show that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduce to approximately of the total arc energy a detail energy balance of the anode be establish the anode ablation could be reduce to a negligible amount the dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirate gas be investigate for various arc length and current between amp and aj qualitative observation be make and high speed motion picture be take to study flow phenomenon in the arc at various mass flow velocity introduction the high heat flux exist at the electrode surface of electric arc necessitate extensive cool to prevent electrode ablation the cool requirement be particularly severe at the anode in free burn electric arc for instance approximately of the total arc power be transfer to the anode give rise to local heat flux in excess of af a measure by the author the exact value depend on the arc atmosphere in plasma generator a currently commercially available for industrial use or a high temperature research tool often more than of the total energy input be be transfer to the cool medium of the anode the high heat transfer rat at the anode compare with those at the cathode can be explain by the physical phenomenon occur in free burn arc in plasma generator the superimpose force convection may modify the picture somewhat the heat transfer to the anode be due to the follow effect heat of condensation work function plus kinetic energy of the electron impinge on the anode this energy transfer depend on the current the temperature in the arc column the anode material and the condition in the anode sheath heat transfer by molecular conduction a well a by radiation from the arc column the heat transfer to the anode in free burn arc be enhance by a hot gas jet flow from the cathode towards the anode with velocity up af this phenomenon have be experimentally investigate in detail by maecker ref the pressure gradient produce the jet be due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode hence the flow condition at the anode of free burn arc resemble those near a stagnation point it be apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cool requirement for the anode of free burn arc be large compare with those for the cathode the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these condition however the anode be still the part receive the large heat flux an attempt to improve the life of the anode or the efficiency of the plasma generator must therefore aim at a reduction of the anode loss the follow possibility exist for achieve this the use of high voltage and low current by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a give power output continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic force feedback of the energy transfer to the anode by apply gas transpiration through the anode the third method be to our knowledge successfully apply for the first time by c sheer and co worker ref the purpose of the present study be to study the thermal condition and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cool anode a well a the effect of blow on the arc voltage gas injection through a porous anode transpiration cool not only feed back the energy transfer to the anode by the above mention process but also modify the condition in the arc itself a detail study of this latter phenomenon be not attempt in this paper argon be use a a blow gas to exclude any effect of dissociation or chemical reaction the anode material be porous graphite sinter porous metal should be usable in principle however technical difficulty arise by melt at local hot spot the experimental arrangement a describe below be base on the geometry of free burn arc thus direct comparison can be draw with free burn arc which have be study in detail during the past year and decade by numerous investigator ref experimental apparatus figure to show photographic and schematic view of the test stand and of two different model of the anode holder the cathode consist of a diameter thoriate tungsten rod attach to a water cool copper tube this tube could be adjust in it axial direction by an electric drive to establish the require electrode spacing the anode in figure be mount by mean of the anode holder which be attach to a steel plug and disk the transpire gas eject from the anode form a jet direct axially towards the cathode below inflow of air from the surround atmosphere be prevent by the two disk show in figure argon be also blow at low velocity mass flow rate af through a tube coaxial with the cathode a an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air the anode consist of a inch diameter porous graphite plug inch long the graphite be national carbon nc which have a porosity of and an average pore size of this small pore size be require to ensure uniformity of the flow leave the anode the anode plug figure be insert into a carbon anode holder a shield thermocouple be use to measure the upstream temperature of the transpire gas it be expose to a high velocity gas jet a plug and a tube with hole in it cylindrical wall divide the chamber above the porous plug into two part this arrangement have the purpose to prevent heat gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection two pyrometer show in figure and pyrometer instrument co model serve for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder three thermocouple be place at different location in the aluminum disk surround the anode holder to determine it temperature another anode holder use in the experiment be show in figure in this design the anode holder be water cool and the heat loss by conduction from the anode be determine by measure the temperature rise of the coolant to reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon shield be attach to the surface provide an air gap of inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder in addition the inner surface of the carbon shield be cover with aluminum foil to reduce radiation temperature of the shield and of the surface of the water cool anode holder be measure by thermocouple to account for heat receive by the coolant but not originate from the anode plug the argon flow from commercial bottle be regulate by a pressure regulator and measure with a gas flow rator the power source be a commercial d c rectifier at amp the cycle ripple be less than v peak to peak with a resistive load the current be regulate by mean of a variable resistor and measure with a mv shunt and millivoltmeter the arc voltage be measure with a voltmeter whose terminal be connect to the anode and cathode holder because of the fall characteristic of the rectifier no ballast resistor be require for stability of operation a high frequency starter be use to start the arc experimental procedure and error analysis transpiration cool anode with carbon anode holder the anode holder show in figure be design with two goal in mind the heat loss of the holder be to be reduce a far a possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be make in order to reduce the number of variable parameter all experiment be make with a constant arc length of and a current of aj the argon flow through the porous anode be vary systematically between af and af the lower limit be determine by the fact that for small flow rat the arc start to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it become highly unstable the upper limit be determine by the difficulty of measure the characteristic anode surface temperature see below since only a small region of the anode be strike by the arc this region which have a high temperature than the rest of the anode surface change size and location continuously for each mass flow rate the arc voltage be measure to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug the surface be scan with a pyrometer a it turn out a very hot region occur on the plug it temperature be denote by af the size of this hot region be estimate by eye the rest of the surface have a temperature which decrease towards the out diameter of the plug the mean temperature of this region be approximate by the temperature measure halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug it be denote by af the mean temperature of the surface be then compute accord to the follow relation af where x be the fraction of the plug area cover by the hot spot assume thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpire argon the gas enthalpy rise through the anode be calculate accord to the relation af whereby the specific heat of argon be take a af this calculation result in an enthalpy rise which be somewhat high because it assume a mass flow equally distribute over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity be expect to be small in the region of high temperature the upstream gas temperature measure with the thermocouple show in figure be af the af value be list in table together with the measure surface temperature and arc voltage simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurement pyrometer read be take along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder a indicate on figure some of these temperature be plot in figure they show no mark dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurement thus the dot line show in figure be take a typical for the temperature distribution for all blow rat the thermocouple in the aluminum disk show in figure indicate an equilibrium temperature of the surface of af this temperature be take a environmental temperature to which the anode holder be expose a far a radiation be concern it be sufficiently small compare with the surface temperature of the anode holder to make the energy flux radiate from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurement the reflection of radiation originate from the anode holder and reflect back to it by the surround metal surface should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surface and of the specific geometry the total heat loss through the anode holder include also the heat conduct through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal part it be calculate from the temperature gradient af at af inch a af the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder be thereby af the temperature distribution of figure give af for all blow rat assume af the temperature dependent value of ye be take from ref the radiation loss from the anode surface be compute accord to af where af be the mean of the fourth power of the temperature af and af calculate analogously to equation
cj03,cj03,informative,learned,2205,a band viscometer be show in figure it consist of two block with flat surface hold apart by shim there be a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be test be place a tape of cellulose acetate be pull between the block and the tape pull the fluid or paste with it between the parallel face of the block in normal use weight be hang on the end of the tape and allow to pull the tape and the material to be test between the block after it have reach terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a know distance be record by the use of various weight data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtain the instrument use for this work be a slight modification of that previously describe in this test a af tape be pull between the block with a motor and pulley at a rate of af with a clearance of on each side of the tape this give a rate of shear of af this however can only be consider approximate a the diameter of the pulley be increase by the build up of tape and the tape be occasionally remove from the pulley during the run the face of one block contain a hole in diameter which lead to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure although there be only four fluid test it be apparent that there be two distinct type two of the fluid show a high positive normal pressure when undergo shear and two show small negative pressure which be negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressure generate by the other two figure show the data on a silicone fluid label cps which give a high positive normal pressure although the tape be run for over hr a steady state be not reach and it be conclude that the reason for this be that the back pressure of the manometer be build up from the material feed from between the block and this be available at a very slow rate a system have to be use which do not depend upon the feed of the fluid into the manometer if measurement of the normal pressure be to be make in a reasonable time a back pressure be then introduce and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicate which be great the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure by this method it be determine that the normal pressure exert by a sample of polybutene molecular weight report to be be over half an atmosphere the actual pressure be not determine because the pressure be beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand the two fluid which give the small negative pressure be polybutene with molecular weight which be state to be and these be fluid which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more newtonian because of their lower molecular weight the maximum suction be of test fluid measure from the top of the block and steady state be apparently reach with these fluid it be presume that this negative head be associate with some geometric factor of the assembly since different read be obtain with the same fluid and the only apparent difference be the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus this negative pressure be not explain by the velocity head af since this be not sufficient to explain the read by several magnitude these experiment can be consider exploratory only however they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressure in the presence of flat shear field which be forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressure such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial material a well a theoretical study the elasticity be a parameter of fluid which be not subject to simple measurement at present and it be a parameter which be probably vary in an unknown manner with many commercial material such an instrument be expect to be especially useful if it could be use to measure the elasticity of heavy paste such a printing ink paint adhesive melt plastic and bread dough for the elasticity be relate to those various property term length shortness spinnability etc which be usually judge by subjective method at present the actual change af cause by a shear field be calculate by multiply the pressure differential time the volume just a it be for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head if the volume be the molal volume then af be obtain on a molal basis which be the customary terminology of the chemist although the af calculation be obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it be interest to confirm it by a method which can be generalize to include relate effect consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross sectional area of a oppose by a manometer with a height of h refer to the same base a h and a cross sectional area of a if af be the change per unit volume in gibbs function cause by the shear field at constant p and t and yr be the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height be af af be the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h the total volume of the system above the reference height be af and h can be eliminate to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in term of h the minimum total potential energy be find by take the derivative with respect to h and equate to zero this give af which be the pressure this be interest for it combine both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium this method can be extend to include the concentration difference cause by shear field the relation between osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be develop in an analogous way in the above development we have apply the thermodynamics of equilibrium refer to by some a thermostatics to the steady state this can be justify thermodynamically in this case and this will be do in a separate paper which be be prepare this have an interest analogy with the assumption state by philippoff that the deformational mechanic of elastic solid can be apply to flow solution there be one exception to the above statement a have be point out and that be that fluid can relax by flow into field of lower rat of shear so the statement should be modify by state that the mechanic be similar if the mechanic be similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar the concept of the strain energy a a gibbs function difference af and exert a force normal to the shear face be compatible with the information obtain from optical birefringence study of fluid undergo shear essentially these birefringence study show that at low rat of shear a tension be present at degree to the direction of shear and a the rate of shear increase the direction of the maximum tension move asymptotically toward the direction of shear accord to philippoff the recoverable shear s be give by af where yc be the angle of extinction from this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the af calculate from the pressure normal to the shear face there be another mean which should show the direction and relative value of the stress in viscoelastic fluid that be not mention a such in the literature and that be the shape of the suspend drop of low viscosity fluid in shear field these droplet be distort by the normal force just a a balloon would be pull or press out of shape in one s hand these droplet appear to be ellipsoid and it be mathematically convenient to assume that they be if they be not ellipsoid the conclusion will be a reasonable approximation the direction of the tension of minimum pressure be of course give by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoid mason and taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoid be at degree at low rat of shear and that it approach the direction of shear with increase rat of shear some suspension break up before they be near to the direction of shear and some become asymptotic to it without breakup this be of course a similar type of behavior to that indicate by birefringence study the relative force can be calculate from the various radius of curvature if we assume a the surface tension be uniform on the surface of the drop b that because of the low viscosity of the fluid the internal pressure be the same in all direction c the kinetic effect be negligible d since the shape of the drop conform to the force field it do not appreciably affect the distribution of force in the fluid these be reasonable assumption with low viscosity fluid suspend in high viscosity fluid which be subject to low rat of shear just a the pressure exert by surface tension in a spherical drop be af and the pressure exert by surface tension on a cylindrical shape be af the pressure exert by any curve surface be af where yg be the interfacial tension and af and af be the two radius of curvature this formula be give by rumscheidt and mason if a be the major axis of an ellipsoid and b and c be the other two ax the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis af and the difference in pressure along the a and b ax be af there be no data publish in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drop to confirm the above formula however there be photograph of suspend drop of cyclohexanol phthalate viscosity poise suspend in corn syrup of poise in a paper by mason and bartok this viscosity of the material in the drop be of course not negligible measurement on the photograph in this paper give af at the maximum rate of shear of af if it be assume that the formula give by lodge of cosec af apply the pressure difference along the major ax can be calculate from the angle of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension can be calculate it value be af from the above data this appear to be high a would be expect from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drop it be appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic property of an ideal gas that be analogous to rubber like deformation the internal energy of an ideal gas depend on temperature only and be independent of pressure or volume in other word if an ideal gas be compress and keep at constant temperature the work do in compress it be completely convert into heat and transfer to the surround heat sink this mean that work equal q which in turn equal af there be a well know relationship between probability and entropy which state that af where zq be the probability that state i e volume for an ideal gas could be reach by chance alone this be know a conformational entropy this conformational entropy be in this case equal to the usual entropy for there be no other change or other energy involve note that though the ideal gas itself contain no additional energy the compress gas do exert an increase pressure the energy for any isothermal work do by the perfect gas must come a thermal energy from it surround
cj04,cj04,informative,learned,2334,a proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline af a a function of magnetic field and temperature be present af be paramagnetic and electron paramagnetic dipole a well a nuclear dipole effect lead to line broaden the line be asymmetric and over the range of field af gauss and temperature af the asymmetry increase with increase af and decrease t an isotropic resonance shift of af to lower apply field indicate a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction the general theory of resonance shift be use to derive a general expression for the second moment af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and be specialize to af the theory predict a linear dependence of af on af where j be the experimentally determine curie wei constant the experimental second moment af conform to the relation af in agreement with theory hence the electron paramagnetic effect slope can be separate from the nuclear effect intercept the paramagnetic dipole effect provide some information on the particle shape the nuclear dipole effect provide some information on the motion of the hydrogen nucleus but the symmetry of the af bond in af remain in doubt introduction the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associate nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance property of nucleus it be important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance be become increasingly use in investigation of structure af appear to be well suit for the study of these matter since it be a normal paramagnet with three unpaired electron on the chromium it crystal structure be very simple and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong af bond provide structural interest we first discus the af bond in af we then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipole with nucleus and show that the theory be in excellent agreement with experiment indeed it be possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effect the information provide by the electron paramagnetic effect be then discuss and finally the nuclear effect be interpret in term of various motional modify model of the af bond in af af bond in af theoretical study of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarity of pack in the solid moreover it will be asymmetric until a certain critical af distance be reach below which it will become symmetric there be ample evidence from many source that the af bond in af be symmetric the af distance in af be aj there be evidence though less convince than for af that the af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime be symmetric here the af distance be aj a number of semiempirical estimate by various worker lead to the conclusion that the af bond become symmetric when the af bond length be about to a but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have be no convince report of symmetric af bond douglas have study the crystal structure of af by x ray diffraction he find the structure contain an af bond with the af distance of af there be then the possibility that this af bond be symmetric although douglas be unable to determine it symmetry from his x ray data douglas find af to be trigonal laue symmetry af with af af x ray and experimental density show one formula unit in the unit cell correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of af the x ray data do not permit douglas to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity lead him to assume a center of symmetry under this assumption the space group must be af and the follow be the position of the atom in the unit cell af this space group require the hydrogen bond to be symmetric douglas find powder intensity calculation and measurement to agree best for af these data lead to a structure in which sheet of cr atom lie between two sheet of o atom the o atom in each sheet be close pack and each cr atom be surround by a distort octahedron of o atom the af layer be stack normal to the axis with the lower oxygen of one layer directly above the upper oxygen of the neighbor lower layer in such a manner that the repeat be every three layer the separate layer be join together by hydrogen bond a draw of the structure be to be find in reference the gross detail of the structure appear reasonable the structure appear to be unique among ooh compound but be the same a that assume by af the bond angle and distance be all within the expect limit and the volume per oxygen be about normal however the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only move the hydrogen atom off af but also allow the oxygen atom to become nonequivalent with af at af and af at af space group af where af represent the oxygen on one side of the af layer and af those on the other side however any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short af interlayer distance of a or the non hydrogen bond af interlayer interaction which be already quite short at aj hence it be difficult to conceive of a pack of the atom in this material in which the oxygen atom be far from geometrical equivalence the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atom to occupy general rather than special position along the axis if the af bond be linear then there be three reasonable position for the hydrogen atom the hydrogen atom be center and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheet all hydrogen atom lie on a sheet but the sheet be close to one oxygen sheet than to the other hydrogen atom be asymmetrically place either randomly or in an order way so that some hydrogen atom be close to the upper oxygen atom while others be close to the lower oxygen atom position appear to u to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural ground a randomization of up and down be more likely than order up and down in position since the hydrogen atom be well separate and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also since order up and down imply a large unit cell for which no evidence exist therefore the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atom be locate symmetrically or asymmetrically experimental procedure sample douglas prepare his sample of af by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at degree c dr douglas be kind enough to lend u about gram of his material this material prove to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible result on various portion of the sample subsequently we learn from douglas that his sample contain a few percent af impurity since af be ferromagnetic we felt that any result obtain from the magnetically contaminate af would be suspect plane suggest another preparation of af which we use here ml of m aqueous af with af add be heat in a bomb at degree c for hour a very fine gray solid about g be form water wash by centrifugation and dry at degree c differential thermal analysis show a very small endothermic reaction at degree c and a large endothermic reaction at degree c this latter reaction be in accord with the report decomposition of af thermogravimetric analysis show a weight loss of center at degree c and another weight loss of at degree c the expect weight loss for af go to af and af be mass spectrometric analysis of gas evolve upon heat to degree c indicate nitrogen oxide and water vapor the small reaction occur at degree c be probably cause by decomposition of occlude nitrate and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than af all subsequent measurement be make on material which have be heat to degree c for one hour emission spectrum indicate af calcium and all other impurity much lower chromium analysis give cr a compare with theory however af adsorb water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss the x ray diffraction pattern of the material take with cuk ya radiation indicate the presence of no extra line and be in good agreement with the pattern of douglas magnetic analysis by r g meisenheimer of this laboratory indicate no ferromagnetic impurity af be find to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of af

cj05,cj05,informative,learned,2276,polyphosphate give renew life to soap product at a time when surfactant be a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphate spell the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphate and synthetic detergent active be recognize and exploit the market today for detergent builder be quite diverse the best know field of application for builder be in heavy duty spray dry detergent formulation for household use these widely advertise product which be use primarily for wash clothe be base on high suds synthetic organic active sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate and contain up to by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate in the household market there be also low suds detergent formulation base on nonionic active with about the same amount of phosphate builder light duty synthetic detergent with much less builder and the dwindling build soap powder a well a soap flake and granule none of which be now nationally advertise a well publicize entrant which have achieve success only recently be the build liquid detergent with which the major problem today be incorporation of builder and active into a small volume use a sufficiently high builder active ratio hard surface clean in household application be represent by two class of alkaline product the formulation make expressly for machine dishwasher and the general purpose cleaner use for wall and woodwork the well quality product in both of these line contain phosphate builder in addition many of the hard surface cleaner use for wall and woodwork have their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate which be still the major ingredient of a number of such product many scour powder now also contain phosphate these hard surface cleaner be discuss in chapter the clean process clean or detergent action be entirely a matter of surface wet clean involve an aqueous medium a solid substrate soil to be remove and the detergent or surface active material an oversimplify differentiation between soft and hard surface clean lie in the magnitude and kind of surface involve one gram of cotton have be find to have a specific surface area of af in contrast a metal coupon af in size would have a magnitude from to a million less even here there be room for some variation for metal surface vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical reactivity spring use a brush surface analyzer in a metal clean study and show considerable difference in soil removal depend upon surface roughness there be considerable difference between the requirement for textile and hard surface clean exclusive of esthetic value such a high or low foam level perfume content etc the requirement for the organic active use in wash textile be high no matter how they be formulate a large number of organic active be simply not suitable for this application since they do not give adequate soil removal this be best demonstrate by practical wash test in which cloth article be repeatedly wash with the same detergent formulation a good formulation will keep the clothe clean and white after many wash whereas with a poor formulation the clothe exhibit a build up of tattle tale grey and dirty spot sometimes with bad result even after the first wash since practical wash procedure be both lengthy and expensive a number of laboratory test have be develop for the numerical evaluation of detergent harris have indicate that two device the launder ometer and terg o tometer be most widely use for rapid detergent test and he have list the commercially available standard soil fabric also give be several laboratory wash procedure in general use the soil fabric use for rapid test of detergent formulation be make in such a way that only part of the soil be remove by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash in this way numerical value for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulation can be obtain by measure the reflectance whiteness of the cloth swatch before and after wash soil redeposition be evaluate by wash clean swatch with the dirty one a be the case with the surface active agent the requirement for builder to be use in detergent composition for wash textile be also high large number of potential builder have be investigate but none have be find to be a effective a the polyphosphate over the relatively wide range of condition meet in practice the problem of hard surface clean be not nearly a complex in hard surface clean the inorganic salt be more important than the organic active indeed when the proper inorganic constituent be employ practically any wetting or surface active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard surface clean formulation hydroxide orthophosphate borate carbonate and silicate be important inorganic ingredient of hard surface cleaner in addition the polyphosphate be also use probably act more a peptize agent than anything else the importance of the inorganic constituent in hard surface clean have be emphasize in a number of paper physical chemistry of wash although there be no question but that the process of wash fabric involve a number of phenomenon which be relate together in an extremely complicate way and that these phenomenon and their interrelation be not well understand at the present this section attempt to present briefly an up to date picture of the physical chemistry of wash either fabric or hard surface the purpose of wash be obviously to remove soil which be arbitrarily class in the four major category give below dirt which be here define a particulate material which be usually inorganic and be very often extremely finely divide so a to exhibit colloidal property greasy soil which be typify by hydrocarbon and fat ester of glycerol with long chain organic acid stain which include the wide variety of nonparticulate material which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soil object miscellaneous soil which primarily include sticky substance and colorless liquid which evaporate to leave a residue the dirt on the soil object be mechanically hold by surface irregularity to some extent however a major factor in bind dirt be the attraction between surface that go under the name of van der waal s force this be a theoretically complicate dipole interaction which cause any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particle or to stick to an uncharged surface obviously if colloidal particle bear charge of opposite sign or if one kind be charge and the other kind be not the attraction will be intensify and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforce likewise a charge particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charge particle will be very strongly attract to a surface exhibit an opposite charge in addition dirt particle can be hold onto a soil surface by sticky substance or by the surface tension of liquid include liquid grease grease stain and miscellaneous soil be usually sorb onto the soil surface in most case these soil be take up a liquid through capillary action in an essentially static system an oil can not be replace by water on a surface unless the interfacial tension of the water phase be reduce by a surface active agent the wash process whereby soil be remove consist basically of apply mechanical action to loosen the dirt particle and dry matter in the presence of water which help to float off the debris and act to some extent a a dissolve and solvate agent greasy soil be hardly remove by wash in plain water and natural water in addition often contain impurity such a calcium salt which can react with soil to make them more difficult to remove therefore detergent be use the detergent active be that substance which primarily act to remove greasy soil the other constituent in a build detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stain and the hydrophilic sticky or dry soil a be well know detergent active belong to the chemical class consist of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecule which exhibit the property of form micelle in solution physicochemical investigation of anionic surfactant include the soap have show that there be little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anion below a certain region of concentration call the critical micelle concentration below the critical micelle concentration monomer and some dimer be present in the critical micelle region there be a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelle which have a degree of polymerization average around for anionic these micelle appear to be roughly spherical assemblage in which the hydrocarbon tail come together so that the polar group the ionize end face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase obviously hydrophobic oleophilic substance such a grease oil or particle have a greasy or oily surface be more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase micelle can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substance so that the micelle volume may be increase a much a approximately two fold although the matter have not be unequivocally demonstrate the available data show that micelle in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process relate to micelle formation be the technologically important ability of detergent active to congregate at oil water interface in such a manner that the polar or ionize end of the molecule be direct towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase in the clean process sorb greasy soil become coat in this manner with an orient film of surfactant then during wash the greasy soil roll back at the edge so that emulsify droplet can disengage themselves from the sorb oil mass with the aid of mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase obviously a substance which be permanently or temporarily sorb on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil substance other than detergent active also tend to be strongly sorb from aqueous medium onto surface of other contiguous condense phase this be particularly true of highly charge ion especially those ion which fall into the class of polyelectrolyte whereas the usual organic surface active agent be strongly sorb at oil water interface the highly charge ion be most strongly sorb at interface between water and insoluble material exhibit an ionic structure see table on p thus for aqueous medium we can think of the idealize organic active a an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface active agent and of an idealize builder a a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface active agent from the equilibrium sorption data which be available it seem logical to expect that polyphosphate ion would be strongly sorb on the surface of the dirt especially clay soil so a to give it a greatly increase negative charge the charge particle then repel each other and be also repel from the charge surface which almost invariably bear a negative charge under wash condition the negatively charge dirt particle then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase this hypothesis be evolve in analogy to the demonstrate action of organic active in detergency it do not consider the kinetic effect of the phosphate builder on sorption desorption phenomenon which will be discuss late see pp the crude picture of the detergency process thus far develop can be represent a af the influence of mechanical action on the particle of free soil may be compare to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale free soil must be disperse and protect against flocculation clean cloth must be protect against the redeposition of disperse soil it be evident that the requirement impose by these effect upon any one detergent constituent act alone be severe upon consideration of the variety of soil and fabric normally encounter in the wash process it be little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituent have synergistic property have gain widespread acceptance in the over all process it be difficult to assign a pure role to each constituent of a build detergent formulation and indeed there be no more reason to separate the interrelate role of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there be to assign individual action to each of the numerous isomer make up a give commercial organic active
cj06,cj06,informative,learned,2148,the thermal exchange of chlorine between af and liquid af be readily measurable at temperature in the range of degree and above the photochemical exchange occur with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at degree use light absorb only by the af in the gas phase with af of af and af of af quantum yield of the order of af have be observe at degree despite extensive attempt to obtain highly pure reagent serious difficulty be experience in obtain reproducible rat of reaction it appear possible to set a lower limit of about af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form af radical the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appear to be proportional to the first power of the absorb light intensity indicate that the radical intermediate be remove at the wall or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reaction introduction because of the simplicity of the molecule isotopic exchange reaction between elemental halogen and the correspond carbon tetrahalide would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibility for obtain unambiguous basic kinetic data it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanism for the thermal and photochemical reaction in both the liquid and gas phase and to determine value for activation energy of some of the intermediate reaction of atom and free radical a well a information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon halogen bond the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seem particularly suit for such study it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chloride on a vacuum system follow by multiple distillation of the liquid it should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfere substance by the usual purification method follow by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine furthermore the exchange would not be expect to be sensitive to trace amount of impurity because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expect to be too high also it would be expect that af would compete very effectively with any impurity a a scavenger for af radical contrary to these expectation we have find it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive effort to prepare especially pure reagent we be report these investigation here briefly because of their relevancy to problem of the study of apparently simple exchange reaction of chlorine and because the result furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atom from carbon tetrachloride experimental reagent matheson high purity tank chlorine be pass through a tube of resublime af into an evacuate pyrex system where it be condense with liquid air it be then distil at least three time from a trap at degree to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction be retain in each distillation the purify product be store at degree in a tube equip with a break seal of several method employ for tag chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange of inactive chlorine with tag aluminum chloride at room temperature be find to be the most satisfactory to prepare the latter silver chloride be precipitate from a solution contain af obtain from the oak ridge national laboratory the silver chloride be fuse under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chip with the resultant product of af which be sublime into a flask on the vacuum line previously purify chlorine be subsequently admit and the exchange be allow to take place the radiochlorine be store at degree in a tube equip with a break seal liter quantity of mallinckrodt low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride be saturated with af and af and illuminate for about hour with a watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inch the mixture be then extract with alkali and with water follow which the carbon tetrachloride be distil on a vigreux column a center cut be retain which be then degas under vacuum in the presence of af purify inactive chlorine be then add from one of the tube describe above and the mixture freeze out and seal off in a flask equip with a break seal this chlorine carbon tetrachloride solution be illuminate for a day follow which the flask be reseal onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distil off the require amount of carbon tetrachloride be distil into a series of reaction cell on a manifold on a vacuum line the desire amount of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine be likewise condense in these cell on the vacuum line follow which they be freeze down and the manifold a a whole be seal off the content of the manifold for liquid phase experiment be then mix by shake redistribute to the reaction tube freeze down and each tube be then seal off the reactant for the gas phase experiment be first freeze out in a side arm attach to the manifold and then allow to distil slowly into the manifold of pre cool reaction cell before seal off this method in general solve the problem of obtain fairly equal concentration of reactant in each of the six cell from a set reaction condition and analysis the sample for liquid phase thermal reaction study be prepare in pyrex capillary tube mm i d and about cm long in a few experiment the tube be make from standard mm i d pyrex tube of mm wall thickness both type of tube withstand the pressure of approximately atmosphere exert by the carbon tetrachloride at degree the photochemical reaction cell consist of mm i d pyrex tube cm long diffraction effect be minimize by the fact that the light pass through only liquid glass interface and not gas glass interface these cell be use rather than square pyrex tube because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing freeze carbon tetrachloride the round cell be reproducibly position in the light beam which enter the thermostat mineral oil bath through a window two type of light source be use a thousand watt projection lamp and an ah high pressure mercury arc the light be filter by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensure that only light absorb by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell relative incident light intensity be measure with a thermopile potentiometer system change of intensity on the cell be achieve by use of a wire screen and by vary the distance of the light source from the cell follow reaction the cell be scratch with a file and open under a aqueous sodium iodide solution carrier af be add and the aqueous and organic phase be separate cell contain gaseous reactant be immerse in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide after titration of the liberate af with af aliquot of the aqueous and of the organic phase be count in a solution type geiger tube in the liquid phase run the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube be determine by weigh the tube before opening and weigh the fragment after empty the fraction of exchange be determine a the ratio of the count minute observe in the carbon tetrachloride to the count minute calculate for the carbon tetrachloride fraction for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride empirically determine correction be make for the difference in count efficiency of af in af and af result the thermal reaction in study the liquid phase thermal reaction some tube from different manifold fill be prepare and analyze experiment be do at and degree follow observation of the fact that the reaction rat of supposedly identical reaction mixture prepare on the same fill manifold and expose under identical condition often differ by several hundred per cent a systematic series of experiment be undertake to see whether the difficulty could be ascribe to the method of prepare the chlorine to the effect of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tube in addition to the method describe in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine be prepare by the electrolysis of a af eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange of af with melt af calcium hydride be substitute for af a a dry agent for carbon tetrachloride no correlation between these variable and the irreproducibility of the result be find the reaction rat observe at degree range from af of the chlorine exchange per hour to exchange per hour in most case the chlorine concentration be about af set of reaction tube contain of an atmosphere of add oxygen in one case and add moisture in another both give reaction rat in the range of to of the chlorine exchange per hour no detectable reaction be find at room temperature for reaction mixture allow to stand up to hour the liquid phase photochemical reaction the liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride be more reproducible than the thermal exchange although still erratic the improvement be most noticeable in the great consistency among reaction cell prepare a a group on the same manifold rather large difference be still find between reaction cell from different manifold fill some reaction tube from manifold fill be illuminate in the temperature range from to degree in a far endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity in all case there be readily measurable exchange after a little a one hour of illumination by compare reaction cell seal from the same manifold temperature dependency correspond to activation energy range from to af be observe while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seem to be indicate in most case it be possible to make estimate of the quantum yield by observe the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminate for a know time in a typical reaction cell and make appropriate conversion base on the difference in the absorption spectrum of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine and consider the spectral distribution of the light source these estimate indicate that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at degree be of the order of magnitude of unity when typical reaction cell to which of an atmosphere of oxygen have be add be illuminate chlorine and phosgene be produce exchange be also observe in these cell which have chlorine present at af the photochemical exchange in the gas phase although there be some variation in result which must be attribute either to trace impurity or to variation in wall effect the photochemical exchange in the gas phase be sufficiently reproducible so that it seem meaningful to compare the reaction rat in different series of reaction tube for the purpose of obtain information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate data on such comparison together with data on the effect of light intensity be give in table in series the relative light intensity be vary by vary the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from to cm the last column show the rate of exchange that would have be observe at a relative intensity of cm distance calculate on the assumption that the incident light intensity be inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate be directly proportional to the incident light intensity direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity have also be assume in obtain the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series where the light intensity be reduce by use of a screen
cj07,cj07,informative,learned,2370,the poynting robertson effect robertson wyatt and whipple which be a retardation of the orbital motion of particle by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinge solar radiation cause the dust to spiral into the sun in time much short than the age of the earth the radial velocity vary inversely a the particle size a m diameter particle near the orbit of mar would reach the sun in about million year whipple extend the effect to include the solar corpuscular radiation pressure which increase both the minimum particle size and the drag far the corpuscular radiation i e the solar wind proton must sputter away the surface atom of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poynting robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force the poynting robertson effect cause the semi major axis of orbit to diminish more rapidly than the semi minor axis with a consequent tendency toward circular orbit a the particle move toward the sun also planetary gravitational attraction increase the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic a the sun be approach at one astronomical unit from the sun the earth s distance the dust orbit be probably nearly circular if such be the case the particle within a distance of about af of the earth will have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be capture into orbit about the earth de jager have calculate the time require for these particle to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the poynting robertson effect which in this case cause the orbit to become more and more eccentric without change the semi major axis this effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorite around the earth since there be a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effect there must be a continual replenishment otherwise micrometeorite would have disappear from interplanetary space there be several possible source accord to whipple cometary debris be sufficient to replenish the material spiral into the sun maintain a fairly steady state asteroidal collision be also think to contribute material it be also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the earth originate from meteoritic impact upon the moon direct measurement of micrometeorite flux one can not make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space even in the neighborhood of the earth where information have be obtain both directly and indirectly the derive flux value vary by at least four order of magnitude this large discrepancy demonstrate the inadequacy of the experimental method and the lack of understand of the various phenomenon involve beyond a few million kilometer from the earth but still in the region of the earth s orbit a prediction of the flux of dust be even more unreliable at great distance from the sun the situation be still less certain there be several source of evidence on the micrometeorite environment direct information have be obtain from rocket and satellite equip with impact sensor in addition the size distribution obtain from visual and radar observation of meteor may be extrapolate to the micrometeorite domain from the brightness of the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light an estimate of the particle size concentration and spatial distribution can be derive for region of space near the ecliptic plane another important source of evidence only recently receive much attention be the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component the core of deep sea sediment and content of collector in remote region be valuable in this category the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth the direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the earth be obtain from piezoelectric sensor essentially microphone and from wire gag these instrument be instal on rocket satellite and space probe statistically the most significant data have be collect from the sensor on alpha explorer delta sputnik and eta vanguard these vehicle with large sensitive area have collect data for long enough time to give reliable impact rat for the period of exposure many other vehicle with small sensitive area exposure time product contribute some information the impact rate on alpha for event be af for particle of mass great than af dubin this mass threshold be derive from the detector calibration and an assume impact velocity of af the data show daily and diurnal variation ninety per cent of the record impact occur between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate be a much a an order of magnitude one may conclude that most of the detect micrometeoritic material be concentrate in orbital stream which intersect the earth s orbit there have be contradictory report from delta and the data quote here be believe to be the more reliable on may a very large increase occur with af of mass between af and af for the next two day the impact rate be af and for the next nine day the impact rate be less than af nazarova the data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particle and may have lead to the high estimate of micrometeorite flux preliminary data from eta give an average impact rate of af for mass large than af for about event in a day period lagow and alexander the day to day rate vary by less than a factor of the data have not yet be analyze for diurnal variation note that the mass threshold be four time that of alpha and that the flux be one fifth a large if one assume that the average flux do not change between measurement a mass distribution curve be obtain which relate the flux of particle large than a give radius to the inverse power of the radius space probe have yield little information pioneer record a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of count in hour with detector sensitive to three mass interval and base on a few count the second and third russian space probe indicate that the flux of the small particle detect be less than that of large one be base on so few event these result be of dubious validity the calibration of piezoelectric sensor in term of the particle parameter be very uncertain many worker believe that the response be proportional to the incident momentum of the particle a relation deduce from laboratory result linearly extrapolate to meteoritic velocity however one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impact would cause a deviation from a linear relationship in the unite state most of the sensor be calibrate by drop small sphere on their sensitive surface the russian experimenter claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensor be cause by the incident momentum with the remainder be momentum of eject material from the sensor this ejection momentum be linearly relate to the particle energy they quote about the same mass threshold a that of the u s apparatus but a momentum threshold about time great there be a difference in the experimental arrangement in that the u s microphone be attach directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instrument be isolate from the skin the threshold mass be derive from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of af in the u s work and af in the u s s r work the threshold mass of about af correspond to a m diameter sphere of density af however the conversion from mass to size be unreliable since many photographic meteor give evidence of a fluffy loosely bind meteorite structure with density a low a af to what extent such low density apply to micrometeorite be unknown the velocity value use be also open to some question if a substantial fraction of the dust be orbit about the earth only about one third the above mention average velocity should be use in derive the mass zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket a phenomenon also to be expect if the dust before capture be in circular orbit about the sun a indicate by the trend of the small visible meteor the diurnal variation in the observe flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity the flux of micrometeorite in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimate by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data a summary of meteorite data prepare by whipple on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence be give in table from an estimate mass of g for a zero magnitude meteorite the other mass be derive with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of for each unit increase in magnitude the radius be calculate from the mass by assume sphere of density af except for the small particle which must have a high mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar radiation pressure the flux value be for all particle with mass great than the give mass and be base on an estimate of the number of visual meteor it be assume that the flux value increase by a factor of per magnitude in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude be constant the value agree with the data from alpha and eta the figure in the next to last column be derive with the assumption of per cent shielding by the earth hence these figure apply immediately above the earth s atmosphere the unshielded flux be give in the last column these figure constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the earth of course if there be a dust blanket around the earth the flux in interplanetary space should be less than the figure give here note that the mass scale be one to two order of magnitude great than some previously use for example jacchia derive a scale of g for a af zero magnitude meteorite the old scale be base on theoretical estimate of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light the mass scale use in table be derive on the assumption that the motion of the glow trail be relate to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite permit the calculation of the mass if the velocity be know cook and whipple a concentration distribution have be derive from radar observation sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude man and eshleman extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude cover the range of micrometeorite the approximate equation be af where n be the number of af with electron line density great than or equal to af and q be proportional to the mass of the meteorite therefore n be inversely proportional to the radius cub and in fair agreement with the inverse power derive from alpha and eta data at the fifteenth magnitude af and at the twenty fifth magnitude af these extrapolate flux be about an order of magnitude less than the value from the satellite data and the figure in whipple s table the extrapolation may be in error for several reason the observational data determine the concentration distribution have a range of error which be magnify in the extension into the micrometeorite region the solar electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation pressure and the associate poynting robertson effect increase in effectiveness a the particle size decrease and modify the distribution and limit size to large than a few micron also it have be suggest that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same a that for visual or radar meteorite best and the same distribution would not be expect indirect indication of micrometeorite flux a measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the earth be obtain from analysis of deep sea sediment and dust collect in remote region pettersson most meteoritic material by the time it reach the earth s surface have be reduce to dust or to spherule of ablate material in it passage through the atmosphere for all meteorite the average nickel content be about per cent this be much high than the nickel content of terrestrial dust and sediment and provide a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx present data indicate an accretion of about af ton per year over the entire globe or about af

effectiveness of man it be the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agent by scientific research and development result in the production of bw weapon system man may also be injure secondarily by damage to his food crop or domestic animal biological warfare be consider to be primarily a strategic weapon the major reason for this be that it have no quick kill effect the incubation period of infectious disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect render this weapon unsuitable for hand to hand encounter a man can be an effective fight machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious disease thus an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population center such a large city an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area this concept have stimulate much basic research concern the behavior of particulate biological material the

during the past fifteen year much new equipment and many unique technique have be develop for the quantitative exposure of experimental animal to aerosol of infectious agent contain in particle of

optimal humidity requirement for various agent when airborne neutral or inversion meteorological condition be necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface it will rise during lapse condition there be of course certain time during the hour daily cycle when most of these condition will be meet certain other property of small particle in addition to those already mention in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract be noteworthy in defense consideration the small the particle the far it will travel downwind before settle out an aerosol of such small particle moreover diffuse through structure in much the same manner a a gas there may be a number of secondary effect result from diffusion through build such a widespread contamination of kitchen restaurant food store hospital etc depend on the organism there may be multiplication in some food or beverage product i e in milk for example the secondary consequence from this could be very serious and must be take into consideration in plan for defense something of the behavior of cloud of small particle can be illustrate by the follow field trial in the first trial an inert substance be disseminate from a boat travel some ten mile off shore under appropriately select meteorological condition zinc cadmium sulfide in particle of micron in size be disseminate this material fluoresce under ultraviolet light which facilitate it sampling and assessment four hundred and fifty pound be disseminate while the ship be travel a distance of mile figure describe the result obtain in this trial the particle travel a maximum detect distance of some mile from these dosage isopleth it can be see that an area of over square mile be cover these dosage could have be increase by increase the source strength which be small in this case the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much small scale be illustrate by a specific field trial conduct with a non pathogenic organism an aqueous suspension of the spore of b subtilis var niger generally know a bacillus globigii be aerosolize use commercially available nozzle a satisfactory cloud be produce even though these nozzle be only about per cent efficient in produce an initial cloud in the size range of to micron in this test gallon of a suspension have a count of af organism per ml or a total of approximately af spore be aerosolize the spraying operation be conduct from the rear deck of a small naval vessel cruise two mile off shore and vertical to an on sure breeze spraying continue along a two mile course this operation be start at p m and last for minute there be a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and per cent relative humidity a network of sampling station have be set up on shore these be locate at the home of government employee in government office build and reservation within the trial area a rough attempt be make to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by take sample from outside the window on the first ninth and fifteenth floor of a government office build all sampler be operate for a period of two hour except one which be operate for four hour in this instance there be a dosage of during the first two hour and a total dosage of for the four hour period a four fold increase this suggest that the sampling period particularly at the more distant location should have be increase a can be see from figure an extensive area be cover by this aerosol the maximum distance sample be mile from the source a can be see from these dosage isopleth approximately square mile be cover within the area sample it be quite likely that an even great area be cover particularly downwind the dosage in the three level of the vertical profile be af this be not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol a number of unique medical problem might be create when man be expose to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry some agent have be show to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animal when expose to aerosol of optimum particle size than by the natural portal botulinal toxin for example be several thousand fold more toxic by this route than when give per o in some instance a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure make diagnosis difficult in tularemia produce by aerosol exposure one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of rabbit fever on a finger an enemy would obviously choose an agent that be believe to be highly infectious agent that be know to cause frequent infection among laboratory worker such a those cause q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category an agent would likely be select which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirement it be obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property in this connection it should be capable of be disseminate without excessive destruction moreover it should not be so fastidious in it growth requirement a to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable an aggressor would use an agent against which there be a minimal naturally acquire or artificially induce immunity in a target population a solid immunity be the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralize it must be remember however that there be many agent for which there be no solid immunity and a partial or low grade immunity may be break by an appropriate dose of agent there be a broad spectrum of organism from which selection for a specify military purpose might be make an enemy might choose an acutely debilitate microorganism a chronic disease producer or one cause a high rate of lethality it be possible that certain mutational form may be produce such a antibiotic resistant strain mutant may also be develop with change in biochemical property that be of importance in identification all of these consideration be of critical importance in consider defense and medical management biological agent be of course highly host specific they do not destroy physical structure a be true of high explosive this may be of override importance in consider military objective the question of epidemic disease merit some discussion only a limit effort have be devote to this problem some of those who question the value of bw have assume that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemic they then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factor concern in the rise and fall of epidemic it be unlikely that a plan episode could be initiate they argue far and somewhat contradictorily that our knowledge and resource in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease this be why this approach to bw defense have not be give major attention our major problem be what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target this of course do not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agent that be associate naturally with epidemic disease a hypothetical example will illustrate this point let u assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus rickettsia prowazwki over city a and that a large number of case of typhus fever result therefrom no epidemic be initiate nor be one expect because the population in city a be not lousy lousiness be a prerequisite for epidemic typhus in this case then the military objective be accomplish with an epidemic agent solely through the result secure in the initial attack this be do with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic on the other hand a similar attack might have be make on city b whose population be know to be lousy one might expect some spread of the disease in this case result in increase effectiveness of the attack the major defensive problem be concern with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agent from appropriate disseminate device it should be no more difficult to deliver such device than other weapon the same delivery vehicle whether they be airplane submarine or guide missile should be usable if it be possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city biological agent be moreover suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which impose many problem in defense a few obvious target area of great importance might be mention the air condition and ventilate system of large build be subject to attack america be rapidly become a nation that us process precook and even predigest food this be an enormous industry that be subject to sabotage one must include the preparation of soft drink and the process of milk and milk product huge industry be involve also in the production of biological product drug and cosmetic which be liable to this type of attack
cj09,cj09,informative,learned,2302,a variety of technique have be direct toward the isolation and study of blood group antibody these include low temperature ethanol cohn fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange cellulose modification of the last technique have be apply by several group of investigator abelson and rawson use a stepwise elution scheme fractionate whole serum contain abo and rh antibody on diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose speer and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibody of whole serum use a series of gradient for elution from aj fahey and morrison use a single continuous gradient at constant ph for the fractionation of anti a and anti b agglutinin from preisolate yg globulin sample in the present work whole serum have be fractionate by chromatography on deae cellulose use single gradient similar to those describe by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological property of the fraction contain antibody of the abo and rh system have be describe material and method sample serum sample be obtain from normal group a group b and group o donor three of the anti rh serum use be take from recently sensitize individual one contain complete antibody and have a titer of in saline the second contain incomplete antibody and show titer of in albumin and by the indirect coombs test the third contain the mix type of complete and incomplete antibody have titer of in saline in albumin and by the indirect coombs test in addition one serum be obtain from a donor r e who have be sensitize year previously this serum exhibit titer of in albumin and by the indirect coombs test these antibody titer be determine by reaction with homozygous af red cell serological technique anti a and anti b activity be determine in fraction from the serum of group a group b or group o donor by the follow tube agglutination method one drop of each sample be add to one drop of a suspension of group af or group b red cell in a small af test tube in several instance group o cell be also use a control the red cell be use within day after donation and be wash with large amount of saline before use the mixture of sample plus cell suspension be allow to stand at room temperature for aj the tube be then centrifuge at rpm for min and examine macroscopically for agglutination for the albumin method equal volume of bovine albumin sample and cell suspend in saline be allow to stand at room temperature for hr and then be centrifuge at rpm for aj all sample be test by both the saline and albumin method the activity of fraction of serum contain rh antibody be test by the saline albumin and indirect coombs technique homozygous and heterozygous af cell af and homozygous and heterozygous af cell be use to test each sample however in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the result obtain with homozygous af and homozygous af cell will be present here the saline and albumin test be perform a describe for the abo sample except that the mixture be incubate for hr at degree c before centrifugation the saline tube be save and use for the indirect coombs test in the follow manner the cell be wash three time with saline anti human serum be add the cell be resuspend and the mixture be centrifuge at rpm for min and examine for agglutination the anti human serum use be prepare by inject whole human serum into rabbit those antiserum show by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the broad spectrum type be select for use in the present study the red cell for the rh antibody test be use within day after draw except for the af cell which have be glycerolize and store at degree c for approximately year these cell be thaw at degree c for min and be deglycerolize by alternately centrifuge and mix with descend concentration of glycerol solution and the cell be then wash three time with saline and resuspend to in saline chromatography blood sample be allow to clot at room temperature for hr centrifuge and the serum be remove the serum be measure volumetrically and subsequently dialyze in the cold for at least hr against three to four change approximately ml each of start buffer this buffer ph be m in af and m in tris hydroxymethyl aminometha tris after dialysis the sample be centrifuge and the supernatant place on a af cm column of eeae cellulose equilibrate with start buffer the deae cellulose contain meq of n g be prepare in our laboratory by the method of peterson and sober from powder cellulose mesh the small amount of insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis be suspend in approximately ml of start buffer centrifuge resuspend in ml of isotonic saline and test for antibody activity the chromatography be do at degree c use gradient elution essentially accord to sober and peterson the deep concave gradient employ fig be obtain with a nine chamber gradient elution device varigrad reference and have be describe elsewhere the other a shallow concave gradient fig be produce with a so call cone sphere apparatus the cone be a liter erlenmeyer flask and the sphere a liter round bottom flask each initially contain ml of buffer in the sphere be start buffer and in the cone be final buffer m in both af and tris ph a flow rate of af be use and ml fraction be collect approximately fraction be obtain from each column these be read at m ym in a beckman model du spectrophotometer and test for antibody activity a describe above paper electrophoresis for protein identification fraction from the column be concentrate by pervaporation against a stream of air at degree c or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permit simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline during the latter procedure the temperature be maintain at degree c by surround the apparatus with ice because negative pressure dialysis give well recovery of protein permit detection of protein concentrate from very dilute solution and be a gentler procedure it be use in all but the early experiment paper electrophoresis be carry out on the concentrate sample in a spinco model r cell use barbital buffer ph ionic strength at room temperature on whatman mm filter paper five milliampere cell be apply for hr after which the strip be stain with bromphenol blue and densitometry be carry out use a spinco analytrol when paper electrophoresis be to be use for preparation eight strip of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrate by negative pressure dialysis be run chamber under the condition describe above at the end of the run the strip in the third and sixth position in each chamber be dry stain for hr wash and dry while the other strip be maintain in a horizontal position at degree c the unstained strip be then mark use the stain one a a guide and cut transversely so a to separate the various protein band the strip section contain a give protein be pool elute with ml of isotonic saline and the eluate be test for antibody activity ultracentrifugation fraction from the column which be to be subject to analytical ultracentrifugation be concentrate by negative pressure dialysis and dialyze for hr in the cold against at least volume of phosphate buffer saline ph ionic strength they be then centrifuge at pm for to min at degree c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of to sedimentation coefficient be compute a af value and relative amount of the various component be calculate from the schlieren pattern for preparative ultracentrifugation fraction from the column be concentrate by negative pressure dialysis to volume of ml or less transfer to cellulose tube and dilute to ml with isotonic saline ultracentrifugation be then carry out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at rpm for to min refrigeration be use throughout the run successive ml fraction be then draw off with a hypodermic syringe start at the top of the tube and test for agglutinin activity other method will be describe below experimental and result the insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis against start buffer always show intense agglutinin activity regardless of the blood group of the donor with either of the gradient describe chromatography on deae cellulose separate agglutinin of the abo series into at least three region fig and one of extremely low anionic bind capacity one of low anionic bind capacity and one of high anionic bind capacity these have be label region and respectively in fig when the early part of the gradient be flatten either by use the gradient show in fig or by allow the cone sphere gradient to become establish more slowly region activity could sometimes be separate into two area donor p j and r s fig and e m fig the latter procedure give rise to a small active protein peak region a between region and in of experiment on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic bind capacity be detect region fig moreover after concentration use negative pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detect in the region designate a donor p j d a and j f fig not all these region exhibit equal agglutinate activity a evidence by titer and the extent of the active area in all case most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic bind capacity this be particularly noticeable in group a and group b serum in which case activity in region and be usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detect at all there appear to be no difference in the distribution of anti a and anti b activity in group o serum though in two group o donor j f and e m only one type of agglutinin be find in the region of low anionic bind capacity fig and several sample of citrate plasma be fractionate in our laboratory by method of cohn et al these fraction be test for abo agglutinin activity use fraction from group ab plasma a a control a expect most of the activity be find in fraction af with slight activity see in fraction a sample of fraction af from group o plasma be dissolve in start buffer dialyze against this buffer and subject to chromatography use the gradient show in fig once again both anti a and anti b activity be find in the insoluble material precipitate during dialysis similarly both type of antibody be find in three region of the chromatographic eluate have extremely low low and high anionic bind capacity respectively fig chromatography of whole serum reveal that the area of rh antibody activity be generally continuous and wide the incomplete antibody activity appear in the early part of the chromatogram the complete in the latter part the serum contain the mix type of complete and incomplete antibody show activity in both region fig in all case the activity against af cell be spread over a wide area than that with af cell regardless of the type of test saline albumin indirect coombs use for comparison the insoluble material result from dialysis against start buffer always show strong activity in fact agglutination of af cell in saline could be produce by the insoluble material from serum contain only incomplete antibody activity this be late know to be the result of concentrate the minute amount of complete antibody find in these serum when the insoluble fraction be suspend in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detect
cj10,cj10,informative,learned,2262,apart from the honeybee practically all be and bumblebee hibernate in a state of torpor occasionally you may come across one or two bumblebee in the cold season when you be turn over sod in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all they keep their wing and foot press tightly against their body and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lump of dirt i must add at once that these animal be what we call queen young female that have mat in the previous summer or autumn it be on them alone that the future of their race depend for all their relative mother husband brother and unmated sister have perish with the arrival of the cold weather even some of the queen will die before the winter be over fall prey to enemy or disease the survivor emerge on some nice sunny day in march or april when the temperature be close to degree and there be not too much wind now the thing for u to do be to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currant such a the red rib sanguineum of our pacific northwest or otherwise a good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably one with male or staminate catkin the bloom of rib and of the willow and sloe be the place where large number of our early insect will assemble honeybee bumblebee and other wild be and also various kind of fly it be a happy buzz crowd each male willow catkin be compose of a large number of small flower it be not difficult to see that the stamen of the catkin be always arrange in pair and that each individual flower be nothing but one such pair stand on a green black tip little scale by scrutinize the flower one can also notice that the scale bear one or two tiny wart those be the nectary or honey gland fig page the staminate willow catkin then provide their visitor with both nectar and pollen a marvelous arrangement for it provide exactly what the bee queen need to make their beebread a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all specie be feed the only exception to this be certain be that have become parasite i will deal with these late on quite often honeybee form a majority on the willow catkin a we have already see in the first chapter bumblebee be big hairy and much more colorful than honeybee exhibit various combination of black yellow white and orange let u not try to key them out at this stage of the game and let u just call them bombus there must be several dozen specie in the unite state alone if you really insist on know their name an excellent book on the north american specie be bumblebee and their way by o e plath if we manage to keep track of a bombus queen after she have leave her feed place we may discover the snug little hideout which she have fix up for herself when she wake up from her winter sleep a befit a queen a bumblebee female be rather choosy and may spend considerable time search for a suitable nest place most specie seem to prefer a ready make hollow such a a desert mouse nest a bird house or the hole make by a woodpecker some show a definite like for make their nest in moss once she have make up her mind the queen start out by construct in her chosen abode a small floor of dry grass or some woolly material on this she build an egg compartment or egg cell which be fill with that famous pollen and nectar mixture call beebread she also build one or two waxen cup which she fill with honey then a group of egg be deposit in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment be close the queen afterward keep incubate and guard her egg like a mother hen take a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pot when the larva hatch they fee on the beebread although they also receive extra honey meal from their mother she continue to add to the pollen supply a need the larva keep warm by the queen be full grow in about ten day each now make a tough papery cocoon and pupate after another two week the first young emerge four to eight small daughter that begin to play the role of worker be collect pollen and nectar in the field and care for the new young generation while the queen retire to a life of egg lay the first worker be do not mate or lay egg male and mat female do not emerge until late in the season the brood of worker that appear late tend to be big than the first one probably because they be well feed by the middle of the summer many of the larva apparently receive such a good diet that it be optimal and it be then that young queen begin to appear simultaneously male or drone be produce mostly from the unfertilized egg of worker although a few may be produce by the queen the young queen and drone leave the nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilize young queen will begin to dig in for the winter it be an amaze fact that in some specie this will happen while the summer be still in full swing for instance in august the temperature then be still very high at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilize egg that will produce female a a result the proportion of male which leave the nest increase and eventually the old colony will die out completely the nest itself the structure that in some case house about individual when the season be at it peak be now rapidly destroy by the scavenge larva of certain beetle and moth not always though do the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just describe some member of the bee family have become idler social parasite that live at the expense of their hardworking relative bumblebee can thus suffer severely from the onslaught of psithyrus the cuckoo bumblebee a it be call in some european country female individual of psithyrus look deceptively like the worker and queen of the bumblebee they victimize the one sure way to tell victim and villain apart be to examine the hind leg which in the case of the idler psithyrus lack the pollen basket naturally the female parasite spend much time in her effort to find a nest of her host when she succeed she usually manage to slip in unobtrusively to deposit an egg on a complete loaf of beebread before the bumblebee seal the egg compartment the host never seem to recognize that something be amiss so that the compartment afterward be seal normally thus the larva of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitant and the store of beebread late on they and the mother psithyrus be feed by the bombus worker bad still in a number of case it have be claim that the psithyrus female kill the bombus queen but let u return after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkin in the spring there be other wild be that command our attention it be almost certain that some of these usually a trifle small than the honeybee be andrena or mining be there be about different kind of andrena in europe alone one of my favorite be a armata a specie very common in england where it be sometimes refer to a the lawn bee the female like to burrow in the short turf of well keep lawn where their little mound of earth often appear by the hundred almost equal in size to a honeybee a armata be much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the specie a rich velvety rusty red the male be much dull after have mat an andrena female dig a hole straight down into the grind form a burrow about the size of a lead pencil the bottom part of a burrow have a number of side tunnel or cell each of which be provide with an egg plus a store of beebread the development of the andrena larva be very rapid so that by the end of spring they have already pupate and become adult but they be still enclose in their larval cell and remain there throughout the summer fall and winter their appearance next spring coincide in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plant in the sacramento valley in california for instance it have be observe that there be not one day s difference between the emergence of the andrena and the opening of the willow catkin this must be due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and the animal after the male and female andrena have mat the cycle be repeat although andrena be gregarious so that we may find hundred and hundred of burrow together we must still call it a solitary bee it life history be much simple than that of the truly colonial bumblebee and can serve a an example of the life cycle of many other specie after all social life in the group of the be be by no mean general although it certainly be a strike feature on the basis of it life history we like to think that andrena be more primitive than the bumblebee the way in which it transport it pollen be not so perfect either it lack pollen basket and possess only a large number of long branch hair on it leg on which the pollen grain will collect still andrena will do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load look like a gay little piece of yellow down float in the wind closely relate to the andrena be the nomia or alkali be nomia melanderi can be find in tremendous number in certain part of the unite state west of the great plain for example in utah and central washington in the unite state department of agriculture s yearbook of agriculture which be devote entirely to insect george e bohart mention a site in utah which be estimate to contain nest female often the burrow be only an inch or two apart and the bee city cover several acre the life history of the alkali bee be similar to that of andrena but the first activity of the adult do not take place until summer and the individual hibernate in the prepupal stage in most place there be two generation a year a second brood of adult appear late in the summer i must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomia this may just be pride in my adopt state of washington but certainly i love to visit their mound city near yakima and prosser in july or august when the be be in their most active period the name alkali bee indicate that one have to look for them in rather inhospitable place sometimes although by no mean always these be indeed alkaline the thing be that these be love a fine grain soil that be moist yet the water in the grind should not be stagnant either they dislike dense vegetation where do one find such condition the best chance of course be offer by gently slop terrain where the water remain close to the surface and where the air be dry so that a high evaporation leave salty deposit which permit only sparse plant growth
cj11,cj11,informative,learned,2277,many other probably nearly all snake at maturity be already more than half their final length laurence m klauber put length at maturity at two third the ultimate length for some rattlesnake and charles c carpenter s data on michigan garter and ribbon snake thamnophis show that the small gravid female be more than half a long a the big adult felix kopstein state that when the snake reach it maturity it have already reach about it maximal length but go on to cite the reticulate python a an exception with maximum length approximately three time that at maturity it be hard to understand how he conclude that most snake do not grow appreciably after attain maturity he be work with specie of java so perhaps some tropical snake be unusual in this respect certain individual giant record late do fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity but it be impossible to know whether this be due to captive condition additional record of slow growth have be omit it be possible to make a few generalization about the six giant themselves there seem to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate length start with the small boa constrictor and ending with the large anaconda data on the former be scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter be sometimes bear at a length great than that of any of the others thereby lend support to the belief that the anaconda do indeed attain the greatest length for four of the six the anaconda and the amethystine python can not be include for lack of data there be also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor be the small and the indian python the next in size at the former stage let u speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda if in a certain part of the range it start life foot long than do any of the other relatively large giant and reach maturity at let u guess inch long than the others a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of nearly foot when it come to rate of early growth the indian python lead with a figure of about foot inch per year for the first two year more or less the african rock python a close second be follow in turn by the reticulate python there be few data on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda be unconvincing and there be nothing at all on the amethystine python it seem likely that the indian python come out ahead because record of it growth have be make more carefully and frequently it respond exceptionally well to captivity and do not reach proportion that make it hard to keep i can not make sense out of the figure for post maturity growth at best the annual increase appear to be a matter of inch rather than foot until well record have be keep over long period of time and much more be know about the maximum dimension it will be wise to refrain from draw conclusion it be often state that the large snake require five year to attain maturity but this apparently be an overestimation the best way to determine the correct figure in captive be by direct observation of pair isolate from birth a method that produce surprise result mature of a male indian python in less than two year his mate in less than three data on the boa constrictor about match this another approach be to estimate from the rate of growth and the small size at maturity result from this approach amply confirm the direct observation about three year be require there be a possible slight difference between male and female in the time require only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be exclude for lack or paucity of data the follow information on snake vary greatly in size but all with less than a foot maximum show when consider with the forego that there be probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time require for it to mature oliver in his summary of the habit of the snake of the unite state could supply data on the mature period for only three specie in addition to the rattler which i shall consider separately these three be much alike line snake tropidoclonion one year and nine month red belly snake storeria two year cottonmouth ancistrodon two year klauber investigate the rattlesnake carefully himself and also summarize what others have find he conclude that in the southern specie which be rapidly grow type female mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they be three other herpetologist have ascertain that in the northern unite state the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it be four or even five year old and that the young may be bear every other year rather than annually carpenter s study show that female common garter and ribbon snake of michigan mature at about the age of two maximum length oversized monster be never bring home either alive or preserve and field measurement be obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimension measurement of skin be of little value every snake hide be noticeably long than it carcass and intentional stretch present no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer in spite of all the pitfall there be a certain amount of agreement on some of the giant the anaconda prove to be the fly in the ointment but the reason for this be not clear the relatively wild condition still find in tropical south america might be responsible there be three level on which to treat the subject the first be the strictly scientific which demand concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by wait for evidence in the flesh this approach reject virtually all field measurement the next level attempt to weigh vary evidence and come to a balance sensible conclusion field measurement by experience explorer be not reject and even report of a less scientific nature be duly evaluate the third level lean on a belief that a lot of smoke mean some fire the argument against this last approach be comparable to that which reject story about hoop snake about snake that break themselves into many piece and join up again or even of ghost that chase people out of graveyard the mere pile up of testimony do not prove to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snake joint snake or ghost oliver have recently use the second level approach with the large snake and have come to these conclusion the anaconda reach a length of at least foot the reticulate python the african rock python the amethystine python at least the indian python and the boa constrictor bernard heuvelmans also treat of the large snake but on the third level and be chiefly concern with the anaconda he reason that a anaconda foot long be often find some might be and occasional monstrous freak over he reject dimension of foot and more his thirteenth chapter include many excite account of huge serpent with prodigious strength but these seem to be give to complete his picture not to be believe detail information on record length of the giant be give in the section that follow growth of the six giant discussion of the giant one by one will include a far a possible data on these aspect of growth size at which life be start and at which sexual maturity be reach time require to reach maturity rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage and maximum length with confirmation or amplification of oliver s figure definite information on the growth of senile individual be lack anaconda at birth this specie vary considerably in size a brood of twenty eight bear at brookfield zoo near chicago range in length from to inch and average inch lawrence e griffin give measurement of nineteen young anaconda presumably member of a brood from south america the extreme measurement of these fall between the lower limit of the brookfield brood and it average raymond l ditmars have two brood that average inch r r mole and f w urich give approximately inch a the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuary william beebe report inch and ounce this snake must have be emaciate for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british guiana in contrast ditmars record the average length of seventy two young of a foot female a inch and four young be bear in london at a length of or inch and a weight of from to ounce beebe have a foot anaconda that weigh only ounce a difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size i have little information on the anaconda s rate of growth han schweizer have one that increase from inch to foot inch in five year and j j quelch record a growth of from less than foot to nearly in about six year it be very unlikely that either of these anaconda be grow at a normal rate in afranio do amaral the note brazilian herpetologist write a technical paper on the giant snake he conclude that the anaconda s maximum length be or perhaps meter which would approximate from to foot meter be slightly less than foot thus his estimate lie between oliver s suggestion of at least foot and the foot monstrous freak intimate by heuvelmans the most convince recent measurement of an anaconda be make in eastern colombia by roberto lamon a petroleum geologist of the richmond oil company and report in by emmett r dunn however a a field measurement it be open to question oliver s foot be partly base on this report and can be accept a probable however many herpetologist remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about foot it be possible that especially large anaconda will prove to belong to subspecies limit to a small area in snake difference in size be a common characteristic of subspecies boa constrictor a colombian female s brood of sixteen boa constrictor bear in the staten island zoo average inch this birth length seem to be typical when some thirteen record of newly and recently bear individual be collate little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detect the range be from to inch the former figure be base on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central american female see chapter on lay brood hatch and birth the latter on a normal newly bear individual however a so many of the record be not certainly base on newborn snake these data must be take tentatively final conclusion will have to await the measurement of brood from definite locality alphonse r hoge s measurement of several very young specimen from brazil suggest that at birth the female be slightly large than the male i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity carl kauffeld have write to me of sexual activity in february of young bear in march one female collect on an island off the coast of nicaragua be gravid and measure foot inch from snout to vent her tail should be between and inch long the female from central america which give birth to four be only foot inch long what data there be on growth indicate considerable variation in rate unfortunately no

cj12,cj12,informative,learned,2328,the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout the pulmonary vein however without the limit supportive tissue septum a in type follow a more direct path to the hilum and do not maintain this close relationship fig another mark difference be note here the pulmonary artery in addition to supply the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole the alveolar duct and the alveolus continue on and directly supply the thin pleura fig the bronchial artery except for a small number of short branch in the hilum contribute none of the pleural blood supply it do a in type supply the hilar lymph node the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchus and the bronchiole terminate in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole no bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomose be note in this group lung type fig be to some degree a composite of type and it be characterize by the presence of incompletely develop secondary lobule well define but haphazardly arrange interlobular septum and a thick remarkably vascular pleura fig the most distal airway be similar to those find in type be compose of numerous apparently true terminal bronchiole and occasional poorly develop respiratory bronchiole fig in this instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule do not constitute in itself what appear to be a small individual lung a in type air drift from one area to another be therefore conceivable distally the bronchus be situate between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other a in type fig this relationship however be not maintain centrally here the pulmonary vein a in type be note to draw away from the bronchus and to follow a more direct independent course to the hilum fig the bronchial artery in it course and distribution differ somewhat from that find in other mammal a see in type and it supply the hilar lymph node vas vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchus and the terminal bronchiole a in type it provide arterial blood to the interlobular septum and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply be see fig this pleural supply be derive both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branch such a dual derivation be strikingly demonstrate during the injection process where initial fill would be note to occur in several isolate pleural vessel at once some of these be obviously fill from interlobular branch of the bronchial artery while others be fill from direct hilar branch follow along the pleural surface with completion of fill net like anastomose be note to be present between these separately derive branch an unusual increase in the number of bronchial artery present within the substance of the lung be note this be account for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely follow the pulmonary artery the diameter of this bronchial artery be much too large for it to be a mere vas vasorum fig in distal region it diameter would be one fourth to one fifth that of the pulmonary artery this vessel could be follow to the parenchyma where it directly provide bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed fig also three other direct pathway of alveolar bronchial arterial supply be note via the pleura through the interlobular septum and along the terminal bronchiole fig one bronchial arteriolar pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis be note at the terminal bronchiolar level fig discussion it be evident that many mark and strike difference exist between lung when an inter specie comparison be make the significance of these difference have not be study nor have the existence of correspond physiologic difference be determine however the dynamic of airflow from morphologic consideration alone may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse the volume and perhaps even the characteristic of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse also interlobular air drift may be all but nonexistent in the cow probably occur in the horse much a in the human be and in contrast be present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobule be absent van allen and lindskog a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology be entirely lack at present within certain wide limit anatomy dictate function and if one be permit to speculate potential pathology should be include in this statement a well for example the mark susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be relate to it delicate long alveolar duct and short large bronchiole situate within a parenchyma entirely lack in protective supportive tissue barrier such a those find in type and one might also wonder if monkey be capable of develop bronchiolitis a we know it in man or the horse in addition it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalize emphysema occur in a cow consider it mark lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this occur in the horse or the dog anatomically the horse lung appear to be remarkably like that of man insofar a this can be ascertain from comparison of our find in the horse with those of others birnbaum in the human be the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter be in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial artery a early a le fort claim an alveolar distribution of the bronchial artery in human be in this be reaffirm by cudkowicz the opposition to this point of view have it staunchest support in the work of miller apparently however miller have rely heavily on the anatomy in dog and cat and he have be criticize for use pathologic human material in his normal study loosli although miller note in that a difference in the pleural blood supply exist between animal nowhere in his publish work be it find that he do a comparative study of the intrapulmonary feature of various mammalian lung other than in the dog and cat miller the mean of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery a find in the horse be not clear however this artery be know to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airway and supportive tissue of the lung the alveolus and respiratory bronchiole be primarily diffuse tissue theoretically they be capable of extract their require oxygen either from the surround air ghoreyeb and karsner or from pulmonary arterial blood comroe therefore an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increase amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffuse in nature in the region of the alveolus if this be true the possibility exist that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial artery might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that see in generalize emphysema one would not expect such an event to occur in animal possess lung of type or the presence of normally occur bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomose be first note in by ruysch and thereafter by many others nakamura verloop marchand gilroy and watson von hayek and tobin have all claim their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human be miller be the principal antagonist of this viewpoint in criticism of the latter s view his conclusion be base upon dog lung injection study in which all of the vascular channel be first fill with a solution under pressure and then be inject with various size color particle design to stop at the arteriolar level a early a ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrate with perfusion study in dog that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure be maintain in the pulmonary artery and vein but that increase in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure berry brailsford and daly in and nakamura in reaffirm this our own study in which bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomose be demonstrate be accomplish by inject the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by inject the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards it be distinctly possible therefore that simultaneous pressure in all three vessel would have render the shunt inoperable and hence uninjectable this viewpoint be far support by verloop s demonstration of thicken bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coat which be capable of act a valve in other word the anastomose between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be consider a functional or demand shunt in addition little work have be do on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery pulmonary artery anastomose verloop find these shunt in the human be but be unable to find them in rat elli grindlay and edward also be unable to find them in rat nakamura be unable to demonstrate their existence either by anatomic or physiologic method in dog the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunt be specie dependent be therefore infer certainly the mere fact of fail to demonstrate them in one or another specie do not conclusively deny their existence in that specie it be however highly suggestive and agree well with our own find in which we also fail to demonstrate normally occur bronchial artery pulmonary artery shunt in certain specie especially the dog in conclusion these find suggest the need for a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lung in addition a detail interspecies survey of the incidence of generalize pulmonary emphysema in mammal would be interest and pertinent also for the present great caution should be exercise in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary study if they be to be apply to man this be especially so if the dog cat or monkey be to be use in view of their mark anatomical difference from man finally it be suggest that in many respect the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently know specie summary the main subgross anatomical feature of the lung of various mammal be present a tabulation of these feature permit the lung to be group into three distinctive subgross type type be represent by the cow sheep and pig type by the dog cat and monkey type by the horse lobularity be extremely well develop in type absent in type imperfectly develop in type the pleura and interlobular septum be thick in type and the pleura be extremely thin in type and septum be absent arterial supply to the pleura in type and be provide by the bronchial artery and in type by the pulmonary artery in type and the bronchial artery terminate in a capillary bed share in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole in type the bronchial artery also provide blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed true terminal bronchiole comprise the most frequent form take by the distal airway in type and although small number of poorly develop respiratory bronchiole be present well develop respiratory bronchiole on the other hand appear to be the only form take by the distal airway in type in type the pulmonary vein closely follow the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum this may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barrier present in type this general relationship be maintain peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follow a more independent path to the hilum a be the case throughout the lung in type
cj13,cj13,informative,learned,2294,some of the feature of the top portion of figure and figure be mention in discuss table first the onset profile spread across approximately year for boy and year for girl in contrast of the line in the completion profile exclude center for boy and for girl be bunch and extend over a much short period approximately month for boy and month for girl the maturity chart for each sex demonstrate clearly that onset be a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion be a phenomenon of the late portion of adolescence second for both sex the transverse line in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile although the standard deviation value on which spread of the line be base be relatively large for those center which begin to ossify early table there be considerable difference in this value between center have the closely time onset third the process of calcification be see to begin late and to continue much long for these boy than for the girl a fact which confirm data for other group of child the onset profile and completion profile be construct to serve a norm for child it be convenient to classify a child s onset age and completion age a advance moderate modal or delay accord to whether the child s age equivalent dot appear to the leave of upon or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line when a dot appear close to the end of the transverse line the moderate rat may be far classify accord to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical mark denote the mean age such classification may be call somewhat advance or somewhat delay a the case may be reserve moderate for dot upon or close to the mean in the lower portion of each chart the skeletal age hand of boy and girl may be similarly classify there the middle one of the three curve denote mean skeletal age for the maturity series boy and girl the upper curve denote the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represent the mean minus one standard deviation thus a child s skeletal age dot may be classify a advance when they appear above the middle curve moderate when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve and delay when they appear below the lower curve to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart each contain two kind of skeletal maturity norm which show two quite different method of depict developmental level of growth center first the upper portion require series of film for every child consist of those from hand elbow shoulder knee and foot the lower portion necessitate only film of hand second the upper portion permit comparison of maturity level of an equal number of growth center from the long short and round bone of the five region the lower portion permit comparison of maturity level of short and round bone predominantly since only two long bone be include in hand and wrist a a region third the upper portion deal with only two indicator of developmental level onset and completion the lower portion utilize the full complement of intermediate maturity indicator of each hand center a well a their onset and completion fourth the two indicator be for the most part widely separate chronologically with the extensive age gap occur during childhood for all but one growth center the lower portion provide a rat at any stage between infancy and adulthood onset completion and skeletal age hand of boy and girl may be directly compare and classify use only those skeletal age which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile it may be assume that difference in rat due to selection of growth center from specific region of the body will be small accord to exist table of onset age and completion age for center throughout the body accordingly maturity level rat by mean of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart respectively should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessment be dependent upon onset during infancy and upon completion during adolescence it be clear that there be some difference in the rat but there be substantial agreement since a skeletal age rat can be make at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot a well a hand it seem to be the method of choice when one wish to study most aspect of skeletal developmental progress during childhood a state early in the paper onset and completion particularly the former provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development each within a limit age period such an indicator or indicator be need a mean of recognize specific period of delay in skeletal developmental progress it be state early that one purpose of this study be to extend the analysis of variability of onset and completion in each of the growth center somewhat beyond that provide by the data in table and a one approach to do this figure and have be construct from the mean age and the individual onset and completion age for boy and girl the difference between onset age and completion age with respect to the correspond mean age have be bring into juxtaposition by mean of a series of arrow the data for boy appear in figure and for girl in figure the number system use in table and and figure and be continue for the growth center the dot on one end of each arrow indicate extent of difference in month between the child s onset age and the correspond mean age for the growth center the tip of the arrow represent extent of difference between the child s completion age and the correspond mean age for the growth center thus the alignment of the dot and tip respectively indicate individual variability of the growth center of each child with respect to the mean value for these boy and girl the direction in which the arrow point show how the maturity level of the growth center be change at completion from the level at onset when the dot and tip coincide the classification use in this paper be same schedule the length of the arrow indicate amount of slow or acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference in month can be read roughly by refer the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure or more precisely by refer to the original data in the appropriate table the difference between the sequence of onset of ossification for the sex govern the number sequence in figure and this difference be readily clarify by refer to table for example arrow in figure portray the proximal radial epiphysis for boy whereas the same epiphysis for girl be portray by arrow in figure for the boy this epiphysis be markedly delay at onset but near the mean at completion thus the span of it ossification be shorten and the center s ability to catch up in ossification be demonstrate in contrast for the girl the epiphysis be slightly advance at onset and delay at completion obviously the slow for her may have occur at any point between onset and completion the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure show that slow may have occur for her during the prepubescent period length of the shaft of these arrow may be evaluate accord to the standard deviation value for each center in table we have attempt to simplify the extensive task of analyze onset age and completion age of each child more than value for the entire group by construct figure for each of the center so that the data for all boy and of the girl will appear together for each growth center figure and be example of our method of analyze the result for each growth center forty other figure similar to and and the original data use in the construction of all figure and table in this monograph have be include in the appendix the principle use in make each arrow for figure and be apply to the construction of figure and a well a all figure in the appendix one growth center in a short bone distal phalanx of the second finger be chosen a an example for discussion here primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for completion in long and short bone occur in this center for girl near the menarche and for boy near their comparable pubescent stage it completion thus become one of the convenient maturity indicator to include in study of growth dietary pattern and health during adolescence the follow summary base on figure and be an example of one way of interpret the figure construct from onset age and completion age of individual child with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center at the top of figure for example the onset range and completion range line for the chosen growth center have be draw for girl accord to their mean and standard deviation value in table the arrow denote onset age plus completion age deviation have be array in an onset sequence which begin with girl who have the early onset of the girl the growth center depict here in the distal phalanx of the second finger be list a the fifth of those in the seven short bone the mean onset age be month table and the average span of the osseous stage be month the correlation table between onset age and completion age be and that between onset age and span be with due consideration for the limit of precision in assess expect rate of change in ossification of girl age year and the know variation in rate of ossification of these child a describe in our precede paper in the supplement each arrow with a shaft length of four month or less be select a indicate same schedule at onset and completion for this particular epiphysis accordingly girl and may be say to have the same schedule at onset and completion it seem clear from the counter balance shape of the series of arrow in figure that there be about an equal number of early and late onset and completion for the girl accordingly if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occur in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarche might have be forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification for the girl with same schedule a an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceed four month in shaft length in conjunction with it position in the figure girl have a delay onset and far delay completion it be of interest that her menarche be somewhat late than the average for the girl in this group a similar analysis of figure for the boy would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecast their attainment of the pubescent stage boy and have same schedule at onset and completion thus early forecast of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boy boy like girl do not have same schedule his arrow cross the line denote the mean the dot on his arrow indicate early onset and the tip indicate relatively late completion after the figure have be draw like figure and classification of the onset age and completion age be summarize from them
cj14,cj14,informative,learned,2298,interestingly enough the effect of the digitalis glycoside be inhibit by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and be enhance by the absence of potassium wolff b organification of iodine the precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid be not a yet completely understand however the formation of organically bind iodine mainly mono iodotyrosine can be accomplish in cell free system in the absence of addition to the homogenate the product form be an iodinate particulate protein fawcett and kirkwood taurog potter and chaikoff taurog potter tong and chaikoff serif and kirkwood de groot and carvalho this iodoprotein do not appear to be the same a what be normally present in the thyroid and there be no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinate in vitro by cell free system in addition the iodoamino acid form in large quantity in the intact thyroid be di iodotyrosine if tyrosine and a system generate hydrogen peroxide be add to a cell free homogenate of the thyroid large quantity of free mono iodotyrosine can be form alexander it be not clear whether this system bear any resemblance to the in vivo iodinate mechanism and a system generate peroxide have not be identify in thyroid tissue on chemical ground it seem most likely that iodide be first convert to af and then to af a the active iodinate specie in the thyroid gland it appear that protein chiefly thyroglobulin be iodinate and that free tyrosine and thyronine be not iodinate iodination of tyrosine however be not enough for the synthesis of hormone the mono and di iodotyrosine must be couple to form tri iodothyronine and thyroxine the mechanism of this couple have be study in some detail with non enzymatic system in vitro and can be simulate by certain di iodotyrosine analogue pitt river and james there be so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this couple be under enzymatic control the chemical nature of the iodocompound be discuss below pp et seq c thyroglobulin synthesis little be know of the synthetic mechanism for formation of thyroglobulin it synthesis have not be demonstrate in cell free system nor have it synthesis by system with intact thyroid cell in vitro be unequivocally prove there be some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination for in certain transplantable tumour of the rat thyroid contain essentially no iodinate thyroglobulin a protein that appear to be thyroglobulin have be observe in ultracentrifuge experiment wolff robbins and rall similar find have be note in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzyme whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide in addition depend on availability of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain vary quantity of iodine d secretion since the circulate thyroid hormone be the amino acid thyroxine and tri iodothyronine cf section c it be clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from protein before secretion the presence of several protease and peptidase have be demonstrate in the thyroid one of the protease have ph optimum of about and another of about mcquillan stanley and trikojus alpers robbins and rall the find that the concentration of one of these protease be increase in thyroid gland from tsh treat animal suggest that this protease may be active in vivo there be no conclusive evidence yet that either of the protease have be prepare in highly purify form nor be their specificity know a study of their activity on thyroglobulin have show that thyroxine be not preferentially release and that the degradation proceed stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediate alpers petermann and rall besides proteolytic enzyme the thyroid possess de iodinate enzyme a microsomal de iodinase with a ph optimum of around and require reduce triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity have be identify in the thyroid stanbury this de iodinate enzyme be effective against mono and di iodotyrosine but do not de iodinate thyroxine or tri iodothyronine it be assume that the iodine release from the iodotyrosine remain in the iodide pool of the thyroid where it be oxidise and re incorporate into thyroglobulin the thyroxine and tri iodothyronine release by proteolysis and so escape de iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream it have be show that thyroglobulin bind thyroxine but the bind do not appear to be particularly strong it have be suggest that the plasma thyroxine bind protein which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ingbar and freinkel e antithyroid drug antithyroid drug be of two general type one type have a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoro type this ion inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by interfere with iodide concentration in the thyroid it do not appear to affect the iodinate mechanism a such the other group of antithyroid agent or drug be typify by thiouracil these drug have no effect on the iodide concentrate mechanism but they inhibit organification the mechanism of action of these drug have not be completely work out but certain of them appear to act by reduce the oxidise form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin astwood on the other hand there be a few antithyroid drug of this same general type such a resorcinol possess no reduce activity and possibly act through formation of a complex with molecular iodine any of the antithyroid drug of either type if give in large enough dos for a long period of time will cause goitre owe to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism the anterior lobe of the pituitary then respond by an increase output of tsh cause the thyroid to enlarge the effect of drug that act on the iodide concentrate mechanism can be counteract by addition of relatively large amount of iodine to the diet the antithyroid drug of the thiouracil type however be not antagonise by such mean besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol type certain antithyroid drug have be find in naturally occur food the most conclusively identify be l vinyl thio oxazolidone which be isolate from rutabaga greer it be presume to occur in other member of the brassica family there be some evidence that naturally occur goitrogen may play a role in the development of goitre particularly in tasmania and australia clements and wishart there it seem that the goitrogen ingest by dairy animal be itself inactive but be convert in the animal to an active goitrogen which be then secrete in the milk f dietary influence besides the presence of goitrogen in the diet the level of iodine itself in the diet play a major role in govern the activity of the thyroid gland in the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine cause thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and increase thyroid activity money rall and rawson stanbury brownell riggs perinetti itoiz and del castillo in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre be about ymg per day with lower level thyroid hypertrophy and increase thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a large proportion of the daily intake of iodine far the gland be able to re use a large fraction of the thyroid hormone de iodinate peripherally in the presence of a low iodine intake thyroglobulin label in vivo with af be find to contain more mono iodotyrosine than normal the amount of di iodotyrosine and iodothyronine be correspondingly reduce this appear to result from both a reduce amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinate thyroglobulin if the deficiency persist long enough it be reasonable to suppose that the af label will reflect the af distribution in the thyroglobulin similar result might be expect from the influence of drug or pathological condition that limit iodide trap or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis b the thyroid stimulate hormone the name thyroid stimulate hormone tsh have be give to a substance find in the anterior pituitary gland of all specie of animal so test for it presence the hormone have also be call thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone at the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism tsh act on the thyroid but for bio assay of the hormone there be a number of property by which it activity may be estimate include release of iodine from the thyroid increase in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cell and increase in the thyroidal uptake of af here we shall restrict discussion to those method that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determine the concentration of tsh in blood brown have review generally the various method of assay tsh and the reader be refer to her paper for far information on the subject chemical constitution and physical property of pituitary tsh a long ago a it be point out by niepce that there be a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid this connection be clarify by smith and smith who show that saline extract of fresh bovine pituitary gland could re activate the atrophy thyroid of hypophysectomise tadpole the first attempt to isolate tsh come a decade late when janssen and loeser use trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble tsh from insoluble impurity after their work other investigator apply salt fractionation technique to the problem a well a fractionation with organic solvent such a acetone albert have conclude that the most active preparation of tsh make during this period from to be probably about to time a potent a the start material much of this work have be review by white and by albert development up to about have be discuss by sonenberg in the last few year the application of chromatographic and other modern technique to the problem of isolate tsh have lead to far purification bat and condliffe pierce carsten and wynston the most active preparation obtain by these two group of investigator appear to be similar in potency composition and physical property two problem present themselves in consider any hormone in blood first be the circulate form of the hormone the same a that find in the gland where it be synthesise and store second what be it concentration in normal circumstance and in what circumstance will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction it be therefore necessary to consider the property of pituitary tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood tsh be to be discuss rationally the importance of know in what chemical form the hormone may exist be accentuate by the recent observation that there exist an abnormally long act tsh in blood draw from many thyrotoxic patient adam whether this abnormal tsh differ chemically from pituitary tsh or be alternatively normal tsh with it period of effectiveness modify by some other blood constituent can not be decide without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patient and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary aj in evaluate data on the concentration of tsh in blood one must examine critically the bio assay method use to obtain them the introduction of the unite state pharmacopoeia reference standard in and the redefinition and equate of the usp and international unit of thyroid stimulate activity have make it possible to compare result publish by different investigator since that time we should like to re emphasise the importance of state result solely in term of international unit of tsh activity and of avoid the re introduction of biological unit for the most part this discussion will be confine to result obtain since the introduction of the reference standard a standard preparation and unit of thyroid stimulate activity the international unit u adopt to make possible the comparison of result from different laboratory mussett and perry have be define a the amount of activity present in mg of the international standard preparation the international unit be equipotent with the usp unit adopt in which be define a the amount of activity present in mg of the usp reference substance

of ethyl acetate a recommend by dineen and ade the conjugate be pass through a diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose column equilibrate with neutral phosphate buffer pb contain af potassium phosphate and af preparation of freeze section the technique of cut section be essentially the same a that describe by coon et al root and stem tumor from sweet clover plant infect with wtv be quick freeze in liquid nitrogen embed in ice and cut at ym in a cryostat maintain at degree to degree the section be mount on cold slide smear with haupts adhesive johansen in early experiment and in late experiment with a different mixture of the same component report by schramm and rottger the latter adhesive be find to be much more satisfactory the section be then thaw by place a finger under the slide and dry under a fan for minute until use they be store for a long a week stain technique indirect method the section be fix in acetone for minute and dry at degree for minute some of them be then cover with a drop of af in a moist chamber at degree for minute a control other section be similarly cover with aj section be then wash with pb for minute after blot out most of the saline around the section a

vapor lamp osram hbo the light beam from the lamp be filter through a half standard thickness corn filter in the eyepiece a wratten b filter be use to filter off residual ultra violet light a red filter zeiss barrier filter with the code schott designation bg be also use in the ocular lens assembly a it improve the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence result specificity of stain indirect method in the first few experiment af be pass through dowex chloride twice and absorb twice with mg sweet clover tissue powder the intermediate serum be also similarly absorb with tissue powder section of sweet clover stem and root tumor be treat with solution of af for minute wash in buffer saline for minute stain with af for minute and wash for minute in aj such section show bright yellow green specific fluorescence in the cell of the pseudophloem tissue lee and black this specific fluorescence be readily distinguish from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive section stain with dilution of n and af or with af alone unstained section mount in buffer glycerine or section treat only with n or af do not show such green fluorescence section of crown gall tissue similarly stain with either af and af or n and af also show only the light green nonspecific fluorescence however the nonspecific stain by the af in tumor section be consider bright enough to be confuse with the stain of small amount of wtv antigen two absorption of af with ethyl acetate or two absorption of af which have be pass through dowex chloride n and af with crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder do not far improve the specificity of stain treatment of all the serum with sweet clover protein greatly reduce nonspecific fluorescence especially when the treat conjugate be dilute to with saline in all the above procedure when the intermediate serum be dilute to or with saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence be not appreciably reduce whereas a dilution of the intermediate serum to or dilute the af to greatly reduce specific fluorescence rinse the section with pb before layer the intermediate serum do not improve the stain reaction in addition to other treatment treat the section with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layer af do not reduce nonspecific stain the only treatment by which nonspecific stain could be satisfactorily remove be by pass the conjugate through a deae cellulose column when ml of conjugate be pass through a column af the first and second milliliter fraction collect be the most specific and give no nonspecific stain in some experiment and very little in others in the latter case an additional treatment of the deae cellulose treat af with mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder far improve the specificity after these treatment the conjugate do not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissue or stain them a very faint green which be easily distinguishable from the bright yellow green specific stain with this purify conjugate the best stain procedure consist of treat the section with dilution of af for minute wash with pb for minute stain with af for minute and wash with pb for minute the specificity of stain in wtv tumor with af and af but not with n and af or with antiserum to potato yellow dwarf virus and af and the absence of such stain in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover indicate that an antigen of wtv be be stain direct method af be first conjugate with mg of fitc per gram of globulin this conjugate be pass twice through dowex chloride and treat with various tissue powder in the same manner a describe for the indirect method in all case a disturb amount of nonspecific stain be still present although it be still distinguishable from specific fluorescence in late experiment af and af be prepare by conjugate mg of fitc per gram of globulin these conjugate af have much less nonspecific stain than the previous conjugate with mg fitc per gram of globulin while the specific stain be similar in both case nonspecific stain could be satisfactorily eliminate by pass these conjugate through a deae cellulose column a describe for af the best stain procedure with this purify af consist of stain with the conjugate for minute and wash in pb for minute the specificity of stain with af be establish a follow af specifically stain tumor section but not section of healthy sweet clover stem or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover section of tumor incite by wtv be not similarly stain with conjugate normal serum or conjugate antiserum to potato yellow dwarf virus after pass af through deae cellulose the titer of antibody to wtv in the specific fraction be of the titer before such passage precipitin ring test by r f whitcomb but mere dilution of the conjugate to do not satisfactorily remove nonspecific stain this indicate that increase in specificity of af after pass it through deae cellulose be not merely due to dilution specific stain by deae cellulose treat af and af although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific stain or autofluorescence of cell be not satisfactorily photograph to show such difference in spite of many attempt with black and white and color photography this be chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cell the autofluorescence from the wall of the xylem cell be particularly brilliant distribution of virus antigen result of specific stain by the direct and the indirect method be similar and show the localization of wtv antigen in certain tissue of tumor the virus antigen be concentrate in the pseudophloem tissue frequently a few isolate thick wall cell or rarely group of such cell in the xylem region be also specifically stain but there be no such stain in epidermis cortex most xylem cell ray cell or pith within the pseudophloem cell the distribution of wtv antigen be irregular in the cytoplasm no antigen be detectable in certain dark spherical area in most cell these area be think to represent the nucleus in some tumor section small spherical body possibly inclusion body littau and black stain more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contain more antigen in all case study tissue of the stem on which the tumor have develop do not contain detectable amount of wtv antigen discussion in both the direct and indirect method of stain the conjugate have nonspecifically stain fraction in the indirect method this be evident from the fact that tumor section be stain light green even when stain with n and af or with af only in the direct method af not far treat stain certain tissue of healthy sweet clover stem nonspecifically and wtv tumor section be similarly stain by comparable af after af and af be pass through dowex chloride twice and treat twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder nonspecific stain be greatly reduce but a disturb amount of such stain be still present treatment of the conjugate with ethyl acetate and the conjugate which have be pass through dowex chloride with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover protein do not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically stain substance in the conjugate such treatment of the conjugate have usually be successful in eliminate nonspecific stain in several other system coon schramm and rottger do not report any such nonspecific stain of plant tissue with fluorescein isocyanate label antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus the reason for the failure of these treatment to eliminate nonspecific stain in the conjugate in our system be not know in our work the best procedure for remove substance cause nonspecific stain in order to obtain specific conjugate be to pass the conjugate through a deae cellulose column and in some case to absorb the first and second milliliter fraction with sweet clover tissue powder the specific stain by both direct and indirect method show that wtv antigen be concentrate in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick wall cell in the xylem region but be not detectable in any other tissue of the root and stem tumor a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the pseudophloem cell indicate that it be irregularly distribute in the cytoplasm wind tumor virus be a leafhopper transmit virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation black brakke et al the concentration and apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiply in the phloem and may need to be directly place in this tissue in order to infect plant
cj17,cj17,informative,learned,2291,since emotional reaction in the high vertebrate depend on individual experience and be arouse in man in addition by complex symbol one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excite from the cortex in experiment with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulse from the cortex to the hypothalamus be demonstrate moreover the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation be greatly increase under these condition even more complex and obviously cortically induce form of emotional arousal could be elicit in monkey a on see monkey b but not a rabbit in emotional stress a previously extinguish condition reaction be restore in monkey a and be associate with typical sign of emotional excitement include sympathetic discharge it seem to follow that by and large an antagonism exist between the paleo and the neocortex a far a emotional reactivity be concern and that the balance between the two system determine the emotional responsiveness of the organism in addition the neocortical hypothalamic relation play a great role in primate a mirsky s interest experiment on the communication of affect demonstrate but even in relatively primitive laboratory animal such a the rat sex activity closely identify with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain be enhance by the neocortex maclean stress correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the specie a evidence by the influence of the limbic brain include the hypothalamus on emotion relate to fight and flight and also on sexual function it should be add that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelation probably play a role in the fusion of emotional process with those underlie perception memory imagination and creativity previous experience be obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response the visceral brain a well a the neocortex be know to contribute to memory but this topic be beyond the scope of this paper hypothalamic balance and it significance after this brief discussion of neo paleocortical and cortico hypothalamic relation let u return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and it physiological and pathological significance facilitatory process take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascend and descend pathway thus cortico fugal discharge induce by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spike present in the hypothalamus and cause increase convulsive discharge on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus cause a lessen in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spike until the hypothalamic excitability be restore apparently a positive feedback exist between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex consequently if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability fall below the physiological level the lessen hypothalamic cortical discharge lead to a diminish state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico fugal discharge obviously a vicious cycle develop this tendency can be break either by restore hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico hypothalamic pathway it be believe that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism before we comment far on these pathological condition we should remember that change in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limit distinguish sleep from wakefulness thus a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharge prevail in sleep and a high one during wakefulness result in synchronous eeg potential in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition moreover the dominance in parasympathetic action with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic at the hypothalamic level induce by it peripheral action the autonomic symptom of sleep and by it action on the cortex a lessen in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system with the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus the opposite change occur since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produce the effect of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induce sleep it may be say that the reactivity of the whole organism be alter by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus similar effect can be induce reflexly via the baroreceptor reflex in man and animal of particular importance be the study of the action of drug in this respect although no drug act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it there be sufficient specificity to distinguish drug which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance the former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drug the latter the tranquilizer specific difference exist in the action of different drug belong to the same group a for instance between reserpine and chlorpromazine important a these difference be they should not obscure the basic fact that by shift the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side we produce depression whereas a shift in the opposite direction cause excitatory effect and eventually maniclike change the emotional state produce by drug influence the cortical potential in a characteristic manner synchrony prevail in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizer but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drug the shock therapy act likewise on the hypothalamic balance physiological experiment and clinical observation have show that these procedure influence the hypothalamically control hypophyseal secretion and increase sympathetic discharge they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side this explain the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depression and a shift in the reaction from hypo to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system a show by the mecholyl test some investigator have find a parallelism between remission and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level a indicate by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and increase deviation of this test from the norm nevertheless the theory that the determine influence of the hypothalamic balance have a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patient have not yet be test on an adequate number of patient the mecholyl and noradrenalin test apply with certain precaution be reliable indicator of this central autonomic balance but for the sake of correlate autonomic and clinical state and of study the effect of certain therapeutic procedure on central autonomic reaction additional test seem to be desirable it be assume that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occur spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patient from the application of certain therapeutic procedure follow the pattern know from the sleep wakefulness cycle a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side lead in the normal individual to sleep or in special circumstance to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting in both condition the emotional and perceptual sensitivity be diminish but no depression occur such a be see clinically or may be produce in normal person by drug the fundamental difference between physiological and pathological state of parasympathetic and also of sympathetic dominance remain to be elucidate perhaps a clue to these and relate problem lie in the fact that change in the intensity of hypothalamic discharge which be associate with change in it balance lead also to qualitative alteration in reactivity a state of parasympathetic tune of the hypothalamus induce experimentally cause not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induce stimulus but lead also to an autonomic reversal a stimulus act sympathetically under control condition elicit in this state of tune a parasympathetic response furthermore condition reaction be fundamentally alter when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity be augment beyond a critical level and several type of behavioral change probably relate to the degree of central autonomic tune be observe if for instance such a change be produce by one or a few insulin coma or electroshock previously inhibit condition reaction reappear however if these procedure be apply more often condition emotional response be temporarily abolish in other study loss of differentiation in previously establish condition reflex result from repeat convulsive metrazol treatment suggest a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral process it have far be show that an experimental neurosis in it initial stage be associate with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance drug alter the hypothalamic balance alter condition reaction in a state of depression the positive condition stimulus may fail to elicit a condition reaction but cause an increase synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing alerting effect on the aj these be few and seemingly disjoint data but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alteration in condition reaction occur in a variety of state in which the hypothalamic balance have be alter by physiological experimentation pharmacological action or clinical process on the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy the forego remark imply that the hypothalamic balance play a crucial role at the crossroad between physiological and pathological form of emotion if this be the case one would expect that not only the various procedure just mention which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise we point out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorder and neurotic symptom particularly in certain type of personality but it be also know that the reliving of a strong emotion abreaction may cure a battle neurosis this phenomenon raise the question whether the guidance of the emotion for therapeutic end may not have an even wide application in the area of the neurosis be a strictly physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself wolpe s experiment and therapeutic work lie in this area he show convincingly that anxiety be a learn condition reaction and be the basis of experimental and clinical neurosis and assume therefore that the neuronal change which underlie the neurosis be functional and reversible an important observation of pavlov serve a a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological mean in a condition experiment he demonstrate the antagonism between feed and pain a mild electrical shock serve a a condition stimulus and be follow by feed the pain become thus the symbol for food and elicit salivary secretion condition reflex even when the intensity of the shock be increase gradually it fail to evoke any sign of pain since strong nociceptive stimulus produce an experimental neurosis during which the animal fail to eat in the experimental situation wolpe think that he could utilize the feed pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptom through feed appropriate experiment show that this be indeed possible he then apply this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neurosis he take advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and find a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude be establish for the interpretation of these significant investigation it should be remember that reciprocal relation exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic function which be closely associate with the emotion the feed pain antagonism seem to be base on this reciprocal relation between the tropho and ergotropic system furthermore a functional antagonism exist between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety although in both emotion sympathetic symptom be present different autonomic somatic pattern underlie aggression and anxiety respectively a indicate by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamine the state of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test the psychological incompatibility of these emotional state seem to be reflect in or base on this mark difference conclude remark in our attempt to interpret the emotion in their physiological and pathological range we emphasize the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory system respectively we stress the reciprocal relation of these system with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge a well a regard the hypothalamic cortical discharge although we be still far from a complete understand of these problem a a first approximation it be suggest that alteration in the hypothalamic balance with consequent change in the hypothalamic cortical discharge account for major change in behavior see in various mood and state of emotion in man and beast under physiological circumstance in experimental and clinical neurosis and a the result of psychopharmacological agent in view of the important role which emotional disturbance play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorder and the parallelism observe between autonomic state and psychological behavior in several instance it be far suggest that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiate mental change
cj18,cj18,informative,learned,2290,the primary decomposition theorem we be try to study a linear operator t on the finite dimensional space v by decompose t into a direct sum of operator which be in some sense elementary we can do this through the characteristic value and vector of t in certain special case i e when the minimal polynomial for t factor over the scalar field f into a product of distinct monic polynomial of degree what can we do with the general t if we try to study t use characteristic value we be confront with two problem first t may not have a single characteristic value this be really a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it be not algebraically close second even if the characteristic polynomial factor completely over f into a product of polynomial of degree there may not be enough characteristic vector for t to span the space v this be clearly a deficiency in t the second situation be illustrate by the operator t on af f any field represent in the standard basis by af the characteristic polynomial for a be af and this be plainly also the minimal polynomial for a or for t thus t be not diagonalizable one see that this happen because the null space of af have dimension only on the other hand the null space of af and the null space of af together span v the former be the subspace span by af and the latter the subspace span by af and af this will be more or less our general method for the second problem if remember this be an assumption the minimal polynomial for t decompose af where af be distinct element of f then we shall show that the space v be the direct sum of the null space of af the diagonalizable operator be the special case of this in which af for each i the theorem which we prove be more general than what we have describe since it work with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the prim which enter be all of first degree the reader will find it helpful to think of the special case when the prim be of degree and even more particularly to think of the proof of theorem a special case of this theorem theorem primary decomposition theorem let t be a linear operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f let p be the minimal polynomial for t af where the af be distinct irreducible monic polynomial over f and the af be positive integer let af be the null space of af then a af b each af be invariant under t c if af be the operator induce on af by t then the minimal polynomial for af be af proof the idea of the proof be this if the direct sum decomposition a be valid how can we get hold of the projection af associate with the decomposition the projection af will be the identity on af and zero on the other af we shall find a polynomial af such that af be the identity on af and be zero on the other af and so that af etc for each i let af since af be distinct prime polynomial the polynomial af be relatively prime theorem chapter thus there be polynomial af such that af note also that if af then af be divisible by the polynomial p because af contain each af a a factor we shall show that the polynomial af behave in the manner describe in the first paragraph of the proof let af since af and p divide af for af we have af thus the af be projection which correspond to some direct sum decomposition of the space v we wish to show that the range of af be exactly the subspace af it be clear that each vector in the range of af be in af for if ya be in the range of af then af and so af because af be divisible by the minimal polynomial p conversely suppose that ya be in the null space of af if af then af be divisible by af and so af i e af but then it be immediate that af i e that ya be in the range of af this complete the proof of statement a it be certainly clear that the subspace af be invariant under t if af be the operator induce on af by t then evidently af because by definition af be on the subspace af this show that the minimal polynomial for af divide af conversely let g be any polynomial such that af then af thus af be divisible by the minimal polynomial p of t i e af divide af it be easily see that af divide g hence the minimal polynomial for af be af corollary if af be the projection associate with the primary decomposition of t then each af be a polynomial in t and accordingly if a linear operator u commute with t then u commute with each of the af i e each subspace af be invariant under u in the notation of the proof of theorem let u take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t be a product of first degree polynomial i e the case in which each af be of the form af now the range of af be the null space af of af let u put af by theorem d be a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of t let u look at the operator af now af af so af the reader should be familiar enough with projection by now so that he see that af and in general that af when af for each i we shall have af because the operator af will then be on the range of af definition let n be a linear operator on the vector space v we say that n be nilpotent if there be some positive integer r such that af theorem let t be a linear operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f suppose that the minimal polynomial for t decompose over f into a product of linear polynomial then there be a diagonalizable operator d on v and a nilpotent operator n in v such that a af b af the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent operator n be uniquely determine by a and b and each of them be a polynomial in t proof we have just observe that we can write af where d be diagonalizable and n be nilpotent and where d and n not only commute but be polynomial in t now suppose that we also have af where d be diagonalizable n be nilpotent and af we shall prove that af since d and n commute with one another and af we see that d and n commute with t thus d and n commute with any polynomial in t hence they commute with d and with n now we have af or af and all four of these operator commute with one another since d and d be both diagonalizable and they commute they be simultaneously diagonalizable and af be diagonalizable since n and n be both nilpotent and they commute the operator af be nilpotent for use the fact that n and n commute af and so when r be sufficiently large every term in this expression for af will be actually a nilpotent operator on an n dimensional space must have it t power if we take af above that will be large enough it then follow that af be large enough but this be not obvious from the above expression now af be a diagonalizable operator which be also nilpotent such an operator be obviously the zero operator for since it be nilpotent the minimal polynomial for this operator be of the form af for some af but then since the operator be diagonalizable the minimal polynomial can not have a repeat root hence af and the minimal polynomial be simply x which say the operator be thus we see that af and af corollary let v be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically close field f e g the field of complex number then every linear operator t in v can be write a the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and a nilpotent operator n which commute these operator d and n be unique and each be a polynomial in t from these result one see that the study of linear operator on vector space over an algebraically close field be essentially reduce to the study of nilpotent operator for vector space over non algebraically close field we still need to find some substitute for characteristic value and vector it be a very interest fact that these two problem can be handle simultaneously and this be what we shall do in the next chapter in conclude this section we should like to give an example which illustrate some of the idea of the primary decomposition theorem we have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deal with differential equation and thus be not purely linear algebra example in the primary decomposition theorem it be not necessary that the vector space v be finite dimensional nor be it necessary for part a and b that p be the minimal polynomial for t if t be a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there be a monic polynomial p such that af then part a and b of theorem be valid for t with the proof which we give let n be a positive integer and let v be the space of all n time continuously differentiable function f on the real line which satisfy the differential equation af where af be some fix constant if af denote the space of n time continuously differentiable function then the space v of solution of this differential equation be a subspace of af if d denote the differentiation operator and p be the polynomial af then v be the null space of the operator p because af simply say af let u now regard d a a linear operator on the subspace v then af if we be discuss differentiable complex value function then af and v be complex vector space and af may be any complex number we now write af where af be distinct complex number if af be the null space of af then theorem say that af in other word if f satisfy the differential equation af then f be uniquely expressible in the form af where af satisfy the differential equation af thus the study of the solution to the equation af be reduce to the study of the space of solution of a differential equation of the form af this reduction have be accomplish by the general method of linear algebra i e by the primary decomposition theorem to describe the space of solution to af one must know something about differential equation that be one must know something about d other than the fact that it be a linear operator however one do not need to know very much it be very easy to establish by induction on r that if f be in af then af that be af etc thus af if and only if af a function g such that af i e af must be a polynomial function of degree af or less af thus f satisfy af if and only if f have the form af accordingly the function af span the space of solution of af since af be linearly independent function and the exponential function have no zero these r function af form a basis for the space of solution
cj19,cj19,informative,learned,2333,example of binomial experiment some experiment be compose of repetition of independent trial each with two possible outcome the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occur from one set of trial of such a binomial experiment to another we devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it be a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomenon but also because it have important property that recur in many other probability model we begin with a few example of binomial experiment marksmanship example a train marksman shoot five round at a target all under practically the same condition may hit the bull s eye from to time in repeat set of five shot his number of bull s eye vary what can we say of the probability of the different possible number of bull s eye inheritance in mouse in litter of eight mouse from similar parent the number of mouse with straight instead of wavy hair be an integer from to what probability should be attach to these possible outcome ace one with three dice when three dice be toss repeatedly what be the probability that the number of ace be or or or general binomial problem more generally suppose that an experiment consist of a number of independent trial that each trial result in either a success or a non success failure and that the probability of success remain constant from trial to trial in the example above the occurrence of a bull s eye a straight haired mouse or an ace could be call a success in general any outcome we choose may be label success the major question in this chapter be what be the probability of exactly x success in n trial in chapter and we answer question like those in the example usually by count point in a sample space fortunately a general formula of wide applicability solve all problem of this kind before derive this formula we explain what we mean by problem of this kind experiment be often compose of several identical trial and sometimes experiment themselves be repeat in the marksmanship example a trial consist of one round shoot at a target with outcome either one bull s eye success or none failure far an experiment might consist of five round and several set of five round might be regard a a super experiment compose of several repetition of the five round experiment if three dice be toss a trial be one toss of one die and the experiment be compose of three trial or what amount to the same thing if one die be toss three time each toss be a trial and the three toss form the experiment mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice toss once from that of one die toss three time these example be illustrative of the use of the word trial and experiment a they be use in this chapter but they be quite flexible word and it be well not to restrict them too narrowly example student football manager ten student act a manager for a high school football team and of these manager a proportion p be license driver each friday one manager be chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck on three friday the coach have need a driver consider only these friday what be the probability that the coach have driver all time exactly time time time discussion note that there be trial of interest each trial consist of choose a student manager at random the possible outcome on each trial be driver or nondriver since the choice be by lot each week the outcome of different trial be independent the manager stay the same so that af be the same for all week we now generalize these idea for general binomial experiment for an experiment to qualify a a binomial experiment it must have four property there must be a fix number of trial each trial must result in a success or a failure a binomial trial all trial must have identical probability of success the trial must be independent of each other below we use our early example to describe and illustrate these four property we also give for each property an example where the property be absent the language and notation introduce be standard throughout the chapter there must be a fix number n of repeat trial for the marksman we study set of five shot af for the mouse we restrict attention to litter of eight af and for the ace we toss three dice af experiment without a fix number of trial toss a die until an ace appear here the number of trial be a random variable not a fix number binomial trial each of the n trial be either a success or a failure success and failure be just convenient label for the two category of outcome when we talk about binomial trial in general these word be more expressive than label like a and not a it be natural from the marksman s viewpoint to call a bull s eye a success but in the mouse example it be arbitrary which category correspond to straight hair in a mouse the word binomial mean of two name or of two term and both usage apply in our work the first to the name of the two outcome of a binomial trial and the second to the term p and af that represent the probability of success and failure sometimes when there be many outcome for a single trial we group these outcome into two class a in the example of the die where we have arbitrarily construct the class ace and not ace experiment without the two class property we classify mouse a straight haired or wavy haired but a hairless mouse appear we can escape from such a difficulty by rule out the animal a not constitute a trial but such a solution be not always satisfactory all trial have identical probability of success each die have probability af of produce an ace the marksman have some probability p perhaps of make a bull s eye note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment to be binomial experiment where p be not constant during a round of target practice the sun come from behind a cloud and dazzle the marksman lower his chance of a bull s eye the trial be independent strictly speak this mean that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be compute by multiply together the probability of the possible outcome of the single binomial trial thus in the three dice example af af and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace not ace ace in that order be af experimentally we expect independence when the trial have nothing to do with one another example where independence fail a family of five plan to go together either to the beach or to the mountain and a coin be toss to decide we want to know the number of people go to the mountain when this experiment be view a compose of five binomial trial one for each member of the family the outcome of the trial be obviously not independent indeed the experiment be well view a consist of one binomial trial for the entire family the follow be a less extreme example of dependence consider couple visit an art museum each person vote for one of a pair of picture to receive a popular prize vote for one picture may be call success for the other failure an experiment consist of the vote of one couple or two trial in repetition of the experiment from couple to couple the vote of the two person in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couple who visit the museum together be more likely to have similar taste than be a random pair of people draw from the entire population of visitor table illustrate the point the table show that of the boy and of the girl vote for picture a therefore under independent vote af or of the couple would cast two vote for picture a and af or would cast two vote for picture b thus in independent vote af or of the couple would agree but table show that af or agree too many for independent vote each performance of an n trial binomial experiment result in some whole number from through n a the value of the random variable x where af we want to study the probability function of this random variable for example we be interest in the number of bull s eye not which shot be bull s eye a binomial experiment can produce random variable other than the number of success for example the marksman get shot but we take his score to be the number of shot before his first bull s eye that be or if he get no bull s eye thus we do not score the number of bull s eye and the random variable be not the number of success the constancy of p and the independence be the condition most likely to give trouble in practice obviously very slight change in p do not change the probability much and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference for instance see example of section on red card in hand of on the other hand even when the binomial model do not describe well the physical phenomenon be study the binomial model may still be use a a baseline for comparative purpose that be we may discus the phenomenon in term of it departure from the binomial model to summarize a binomial experiment consist of af independent binomial trial all with the same probability af of yield a success the outcome of the experiment be x success the random variable x take the value af with probability af or more briefly af we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x success for give value of p and n when each number of success x be pair with it probability of occurrence af the set of pair af be a probability function call a binomial distribution the choice of p and n determine the binomial distribution uniquely and different choice always produce different distribution except when af then the number of success be always the set of all binomial distribution be call the family of binomial distribution but in general discussion this expression be often shorten to the binomial distribution or even the binomial when the context be clear binomial distribution be treat by james bernoulli about and for this reason binomial trial be sometimes call bernoulli trial random variable each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produce either or success therefore each binomial trial can be think of a produce a value of a random variable associate with that trial and take the value and with probability q and p respectively the several trial of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable x the total number of success which be just the sum of the random variable associate with the single trial example the marksman get two bull s eye one on his third shoot and one on his fifth the number of success on the five individual shot be then the number of success on each shoot be a value of a random variable that have value or and there be such random variable here their sum be x the total number of success which in this experiment have the value af
cj20,cj20,informative,learned,2211,consider a simple close plane curve c which be a real analytic image of the unit circle and which be give by af these be real analytic periodic function with period t in the follow paper it be show that in a certain definite sense exactly an odd number of square can be inscribe in every such curve which do not contain an infinite number of inscribe square this theorem be similar to the theorem of kakutani that there exist a circumscribe cube around any close bound convex set in af the latter theorem have be generalize by yamabe and yujobo and cairn to show that in af there be family of such cube here for the case of square inscribe in plane curve we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other result a square inscribe in a curve c mean a square with it four corner point on the curve though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c indeed the spiral af with the two endpoint connect by a straight line possess only one inscribe square the square have one corner point on the straight line segment and do not lie entirely in the interior on c from the point p at af to the point q at af we construct the chord and upon the chord a a side erect a square in such a way that a s approach zero the square be inside c a s increase we consider the two free corner point of the square af and af adjacent to p and q respectively a s approach t the square will be outside c and therefore both af and af must cross c an odd number of time a s vary from zero to t the point may also touch c without cross suppose af cross c when af we now have certain square with three corner on c for any such square the middle corner of these will be call the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be call the diagonal point of the square each point on c a a vertex may possess a finite number of correspond diagonal point by the above construction to each pair vertex and diagonal point there correspond a unique forward corner point i e the corner on c reach first by proceed along c from the vertex in the direction of increase t if the vertex be at af and if the interior of c be on the leave a one move in the direction of increase t then every such corner can be find from the curve obtain by rotate c clockwise through degree about the vertex the set of intersection of af the rotate curve with the original curve c consist of just the set of forward corner point on c correspond to the vertex at af plus the vertex itself we note that two such curve c and af can not coincide at more than a finite number of point otherwise be analytic they would coincide at all point which be impossible since they do not coincide near af with each vertex we associate certain numerical value namely the set of positive difference in the parameter t between the vertex and it correspond forward corner point for the vertex at af these value will be denote by af the function f t define in this way be multi value we consider now the graph of the function f t on af we will refer to the plane of c and af a the c plane and to the plane of the graph a the aj the graph a a set may have a finite number of component we will denote the value of f t on different component by af each point with abscissa t on the graph represent an intersection between c and af there be two type of such intersection depend essentially on whether the curve cross at the point of intersection an ordinary point will be any point of intersection a such that in every neighborhood of a in the c plane af meet both the interior and the exterior of c any other point of intersection between c and af will be call a tangent point this terminology will also be apply to the correspond point in the aj we can now prove several lemma lemma in some neighborhood in the f plane of any ordinary point of the graph the function f be a single value continuous function proof we first show that the function be single value in some neighborhood with the vertex at af in the c plane we assume that af be the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and af in the f plane the coordinate of the correspond point be af we know that in the c plane both c and af be analytic in the c plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinate u v with the origin at q and such that both c and af have finite slope at q near q both curve can be represent by analytic function of u in a neighborhood of q the difference between these function be also a single value analytic function of u furthermore one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function be monotone for since it be analytic it can have only a finite number of extremum in any interval now to find af one need the intersection of c and af near q but af be just the curve af translate without rotation through a small arc for af be always obtain by rotate c through exactly degree the arc be itself a segment of an analytic curve thus if e be sufficiently small there can be only one intersection of c and af near q for if there be more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and af near q would not be a monotone function therefore af be single value near q it be also see that af since the change from af to af be accomplish by a continuous translation thus af be also continuous at af and in a neighborhood of af which do not contain a tangent point we turn now to the set of tangent point on the graph this set must consist of isolate point and close interval the fact that there can not be any limit point of the set except in close interval follow from the argument use in lemma namely that near any tangent point in the c plane the curve c and af be analytic and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point this prevent the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolate tangent point lemma in some neighborhood of an isolate tangent point in the f plane say af the function af be either double value or have no value define except at the tangent point itself where it be single value proof a tangent point q in the c plane occur when c and af be tangent to one another a continuous change in t through an amount e result in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve af there be three possibility a af remain tangent to c a it be translate b af move away from c and do not intersect it at all for af c af cut across c and there be two ordinary intersection for every t in af the first possibility result in a close interval of tangent point in the f plane the end point of which fall into category b or c in the second category the function af have no value define in a neighborhood af in the third category the function be double value in this interval the same remark apply to an interval on the other side of af again the analyticity of the two curve guarantee that such interval exist in the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent point in the f plane the function be two value or no value on one side and be a single value function consist entirely of tangent point on the other side with the above result we can make the follow remark about the graph of f first for any value of t for which all value of f t be ordinary point the number of value of f t must be odd for it be clear that the total number of ordinary intersection of c and af must be even otherwise start in the interior of c af could not finally return to the interior and the center of rotation at t be the argument of the function not a value therefore for any value of t the number of value of f t be equal to the finite number of tangent point correspond to the argument t plus an odd number definition the number of ordinary value of the function f t at t will be call it multiplicity at t lemma the graph of f have at least one component whose support be the entire interval aj proof we suppose not then every component of the graph of f must be define over a bound sub interval suppose af be define in the sub interval af now af and af must both be tangent point on the t component in the f plane otherwise by lemma the component would extend beyond these point far we see by lemma that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can only change by an even integer thus the multiplicity of af for a give t must be an even number this be true of all component which have such a bound support but this be a contradiction for we know that the multiplicity of f t be odd for every t we have show that the graph of f contain at least one component whose inverse be the entire interval t and whose multiplicity be odd there must be an odd number of such component which will be call complete component the remain incomplete component all have an even number of ordinary point at any argument and be define only on a proper sub interval of aj we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two point for which the correspond diagonal point in the c plane be on opposite side of c we again consider a fix point p at af and a variable point q at af on c we erect a square with pq a a side and with free corner af and af adjacent to p and q respectively a s vary from zero to t the value of s for which af and af cross c will be denote by af and af respectively we have af plus tangent point these s value be just the ordinary value of af lemma the value af be the ordinary value at af of a multi value function g t which have component correspond to those of f t proof we first define a function b t a follow give the set of square such that each have three corner on c and vertex at t b t be the correspond set of positive parametric difference between t and the backward corner point the function f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t now with p fix at af af value occur when the corner af cross c and be among the value of s such that af the root of this equation be just the ordinate of the intersection of the graph of b with a straight line of unit slope through af in the b plane the plane of the graph of b we define these value a af and define g t in the same way for each t thus we obtain g t by introduce an oblique g t axis in the aj
cj21,cj21,informative,learned,2229,introduction in we investigate a new series of line involution in a projective space of three dimension over the field of complex number these be define by a simple involutorial transformation of the point in which a general line meet a nonsingular quadric surface bear a curve of symbol af then in we show that any line involution with the property that a it have no complex of invariant line and b it singular line form a complex consist exclusively of the line which meet a twist curve be necessarily of the type discuss in no generalization of these result to space of more than three dimension have so far be find possible let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bear regulus af and af and let zg be a af curve of order k on q a general line l meet q in two point af and af through each of which pass a unique generator of the regulus af whose line be simple secant of aj on these generator let af and af be respectively the harmonic conjugate of af and af with respect to the two point in which the correspond generator meet aj the line af be the image of l clearly the transformation be involutorial we observe first that no line l can meet it image except at one of it intersection with q for if it do the plane of l and l would contain two generator of af which be impossible moreover from the definitive transformation of intercept on the generator of af it be clear that the only point of q at which a line can meet it image be the point of aj hence the totality of singular line be the t order complex of line which meet aj the invariant line be the line of the congruence of secant of zg since each of these meet q in two point which be invariant the order of this congruence be af since af secant of a curve of symbol b on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point the class of the congruence be af since an arbitrary plane meet zg in k point since the complex of singular line be of order k and since there be no complex of invariant line it follow from the formula af that the order of the involution be af there be various set of exceptional line or line whose image be not unique the most obvious of these be the quadratic complex of tangent to q each line of which be transform into the entire pencil of line tangent to q at the image of the point of tangency of the give line thus pencil of tangent to q be transform into pencil of tangent it be interest that a correspondence can be establish between the line of two such pencil so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assign to each tangent for the line of any plane yp meet q in a conic c be transform into the congruence of secant of the curve c into which c be transform in the point involution on q in particular tangent to c be transform into tangent to c moreover if af and af be two plan intersect in a line l tangent to q at a point p the two free intersection of the image curve af and af must coincide at p the image of p and at this point af and af must have a common tangent l hence think of a a line in a particular plane yp any tangent to q have a unique image and moreover this image be the same for all plan through l each generator yl of af be also exceptional for each be transform into the entire congruence of secant of the curve into which that generator be transform by the point involution on q this curve be of symbol af since it meet yl and hence every line of af in the af invariant point on yl and since it obviously meet every line of af in a single point the congruence of it secant be therefore of order af and class af a final class of exceptional line be identifiable from the follow consideration since no two generator of af can intersect it follow that their image curve can have no free intersection in other word these curve have only fix intersection common to them all now the only way in which all curve of the image family of af can pass through a fix point be to have a generator of af which be not a secant but a tangent of zg for then any point on such a generator will be transform into the point of tangency since two curve of symbol af on q intersect in af point it follow that there be af line of af which be tangent to aj clearly any line l of any bundle have one of these point of tangency t a vertex will be transform into the entire pencil have the image of the second intersection of l and q a vertex and lie in the plane determine by the image point and the generator of af which be tangent to zg at t a line through two of these point af and af will be transform into the entire bilinear congruence have the tangent to zg at af and af a directrices a conic c be a curve on q meet the image of any line of af which we have already find to be a af curve on q in af point hence it image c meet any line of af in af point moreover c obviously meet any line af in a single point hence c be a af curve on q therefore the congruence of it secant that be the image of a general plane field of line be of order af and class af finally the image of a general bundle of line be a congruence whose order be the order of the congruence of invariant line namely af and whose class be the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of line namely af the precede observation make it clear that there exist line involution of all order great than with no complex of invariant line and with a complex of singular line consist exclusively of the line which meet a twist curve aj we now shall show that any involution with these characteristic be necessarily of the type we have just describe to do this we must first show that every line which meet zg in a point p meet it image at p to see this consider a general pencil of line contain a general secant of aj by the image of this pencil be a rule surface of order af which be meet by the plane of the pencil in a curve c of order af on c there be a af correspondence in which the af point cut from c by a general line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil since c be rational this correspondence have k coincidence each of which imply a line of the pencil which meet it image however since the pencil contain a secant of zg it actually contain only af singular line to avoid this contradiction it be necessary that c be composite with the secant of zg and a curve of order af a component thus it follow that the secant of zg be all invariant but if this be the case then an arbitrary pencil of line have a point p of zg a vertex be transform into a rule surface of order af have af generator concurrent at p since a rule surface of order n with n concurrent generator be necessarily a cone it follow finally that every line through a point p of zg meet it image at p a assert now consider the transformation of the line of a bundle with vertex p on zg which be effect by the involution a a whole from the precede remark it be clear that such a bundle be transform into itself in an involutorial fashion moreover in this involution there be a cone of invariant line of order af namely the cone of secant of zg which pass through p hence it follow that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de jonquieres involution of order af and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either af or af the first possibility require that there be a line through p which meet zg in af point the second require that there be a line through p which meet zg in af point in each case line of the bundle be transform by involution within the pencil they determine with the multiple secant in the first case the fix element within each pencil be the multiple secant and the line join the vertex p to the intersection of zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant in the second the fix element be the line which join the vertex p to the two intersection of zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant the multiple secant of course be exceptional and in each case be transform into cone of order af observation similar to these can be make at each point of aj hence zg must have either a regulus of af fold secant or a regulus of af fold secant moreover if af no two of the multiple secant can intersect for if such be the case either the plane of the two line would meet zg in more than k point or alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determine by the two line would be too high but if no two line of the regulus of multiple secant of zg can intersect then the regulus must be quadratic or in other word zg must be either a af or a af curve on a nonsingular quadric surface we now observe that the case in which zg be a af curve on a quadric be impossible if the complex of singular line consist exclusively of the line which meet aj for any pencil in a plane contain a af fold secant of zg have an image regulus which meet the plane of the pencil in af line namely the image of the line of the pencil which pass through the intersection of zg and the multiple secant plus an additional component to account for the intersection of the image of the general line of the pencil however if there be no additional complex of singular line the order of the image regulus of a pencil be precisely af this contradict the precede observation and so under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that zg be a af curve on a quadric surface continue with the case in which zg be a af curve on a quadric q we first observe that the second regulus of q consist precisely of the line which join the two free intersection of zg and the plan through any one of the multiple secant for each of these line meet q in three point namely two point on zg and one point on one of the multiple secant now consider an arbitrary line l meet q in two point af and af if ya be the multiple secant of zg which pass through af and yb be the simple secant of zg which pass through af and if af be the point in which ya meet zg and if af be the image of af on the generator yb it follow that the image of the line af be af
cj22,cj22,informative,learned,2185,these society can expect to face difficult time a the historic process of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion will be threaten by divisive force the gap between ruler and subject town and country will widen new aspirant for power will emerge whose ambition far exceed their competence old ruler may lose their nerve and their sense of direction national leader will have to display the high skill of statesmanship to guide their people through time of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men s sense of identity feel of a community of interest will have to be recreate in some of the new nation indeed they must be build for the first time on a new basis which look toward the future and do not rely only on share memory of the past nevertheless with foresight and careful plan some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequence of social change which have trouble other country pass through this stage can be escape the unite state can help by communicate a genuine concern with the problem these country face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate form of assistance where possible our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these society to tackle boldly the task which they face at the same time we should recognize that the obstacle to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these country may make them particularly prone to diversion and external adventure of all sort it may seem to some of them that success can be purchase much less dearly by fishing in the murky water of international politics than by face up to the intractable task at home we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion both by offer assistance for their domestic need and by react firmly to irresponsible action on the world scene when necessary we should make it clear that country which choose to derive marginal advantage from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupt the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospect for orderly development a a nation we feel an obligation to assist other country in their development but this obligation pertain only to country which be honestly seek to become responsible member of a stable and forward move world community transitional society when we look at country like iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress have be make in create a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital and where institution of centralize government exist we find a second category of country with a different set of problem and hence different priority for policy the men in power be commit in principle to modernization but economic and social change be proceed only erratically isolate enterprise have be launch but they be not yet relate to each other in a meaningful pattern the society be likely to be characterize by have a fairly modernize urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communication between the two progress be impede by psychological inhibition to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resource human and material can be mobilize to achieve the national goal of modernization already symbolically accept most country in this second category share the difficulty of have many of the structure of a modern political and social system without the modern standard of performance require to make them effective in these rapidly change society there be also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goal the colonial period have generally leave people believe that government can if it wish provide all manner of service for them and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefit of modern life for example in accordance with the fashion of the time most transitional society have announce economic development plan of vary number of year such be the mystique of plan that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon it announcement the civil service in such society be generally inadequate to deal competently with the problem face them and their member often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice self discipline and competence american policy should press constantly the view that until these government demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracy there be not the slight hope that they will either modernize of democratize their society we should spread the view that plan and national development be serious matter which call for effort a well a enthusiasm above all we should seek to encourage the leader of these society to accept the unpleasant fact that they be responsible for their fate only within the framework of a mature relationship characterize by honest appraisal of performance can we provide tell assistance with respect to those country whose leader prefer to live with their illusion we can afford to wait for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see our technical assistance to these country should place special emphasis on induce the central government to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an early stage foreign expert assume in deal with the central government we should encourage the government to develop their own technical assistance to community state and provincial government rural community and other small group make certain that no important segment of the economy be neglect simultaneously we should be underline the interrelationship of technical progress in various field show how agricultural train can be introduce into education how health affect labor productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community and above all how progress in each field relate to national progress effort such a the community development program in the philippine have demonstrate that transitional society can work toward balance national development to achieve this goal of balance development communication between the central government and the local community must be such that the need and aspiration of the people themselves be effectively take into account if modernization program be impose from above without the understand and cooperation of the people they will encounter grave difficulty land reform be likely to be a press issue in many of these country it should be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform program but also to underline the relation of such reform to the economic growth and modernization of the society a an isolate policy land reform be likely to be politically disruptive a part of a large development effort however it may gain wide acceptance it should also be recognize that the problem of rural tenancy can not be solve by administrative decree alone land reform program need to be supplement with program for promote rural credit and technical assistance in agriculture lastly governmental and private planner will at this stage begin to see large capital requirement loom ahead by hold out prospect for external capital assistance the unite state can provide strong incentive to prepare for the concert economic drive necessary to achieve self sustain growth actively modernize society at a third stage in the modernization process be such country a india brazil the philippine and taiwan which be ready and commit to move into the stage of self sustain growth they must continue to satisfy basic capital need and there persist the dual problem of maintain operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralize participation in the program to wide and wide group but these country have make big stride toward develop the necessary human and social overhead capital they have establish reasonably stable and effective governmental institution at national and local level and they have begin to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sector of their economy on the economic front the first priority of these country be to mobilize a vastly increase volume of resource several relate task must be carry out if self sustain growth be to be achieve these country must formulate a comprehensive long term program cover the objective of both the private and the public sector of the economy they must in their plan be able to count on at least tentative commitment of foreign capital assistance over period of several year capital import draw from a number of source must be employ and combine skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward capital flow must be coordinate with national need and plan finally a balance must be effect among project finance utilization of agricultural surplus and general balance of payment support thus although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere be cumulative and many of the policy suggest for nation in the early stage remain relevant the basic purpose of american economic policy during the late stage of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self sustain growth be not prevent by lack of foreign exchange there remain many political and administrative problem to be solve for one thing although considerable number of men have be train bureaucracy be still deficient in many respect even the famed indian civil service be not fully adequate to the tremendous range of task it have undertake technical assistance in train middle and upper level management personnel be still need in many case there be also more basic problem this be the stage at which democratic development must take place if the society be to become an open community of creative people nevertheless impulse still exist among the rule elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralize and authoritarian practice another great danger be that the emerge middle class will feel itself increasingly alienate from the political leader who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism the capacity of intellectual and member of the new professional class to contribute creatively to national development be likely to be destroy by a constrain sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleague and professional counterpart in the west particularly when base upon a single dominant party government may respond to such a situation by claim a monopoly of understand about the national interest convince of the wisdom of their own action and reassure by the promise of their economic development program government may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort become instead more rigid and inflexible in their policy american policy toward such society should stress our sympathy for the emerge social and professional class it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standard and an understand of the tremendous power and potentiality of genuinely open and pluralistic society we have every obligation to take seriously their

cj23,cj23,informative,learned,2337,some of the major function of religion the place of religion in the simple preliterate society be quite definite a a complex it fit into the whole social organization and function dominantly in every part of it in society like ours however it place be less clear and more complex with the diversity of religious viewpoint there be difference of opinion a to the essential feature of religion and there be different opinion a to the essential function of religion nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous advance society though less for the less religious portion religion do perform certain modal individual and social function although the inner function of religion be not of direct significance in social organization they have important indirect consequence if the inner function of religion be perform the individual be a compose order motivate and emotionally secure associate he be not greatly frustrate and he be not anomic he be well fit to perform his social life among his fellow there be several closely relate inner function in the last analysis religion be the mean of induce formulate express enhance implement and perpetuate man s deep experience the religious man be first religious the instrumentality follow religion seek to satisfy human need of great pertinence the significant thing in it at the high religious level be the inner emotional mental and spiritual occurrence that fill the press human need of self preservation self pacification and self completion the chief experience be the sense of communion and in the high religion of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power relate to this be the fact that most of the high religion define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feel that he be relatively secure in an order dependable universe man have the experience of be helpfully allied with what he can not fully understand he be a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and be and movement the universe be a safe and permanent home a number of religion also satisfy for many the need of be link with the ultimate and eternal death be not permanent defeat and disappearance man have a second chance he be not lose in the abyss of endless time he have endless be religion at it best also offer the experience of spiritual fulfillment by invite man into the high realm of the spirit religion can summate epitomize relate and conserve all the high ideal and value ethical aesthetic and religious of man form in his culture there be also the possibility among high religion of experience consistent mean in life and enjoy guidance and expansiveness the kind of religious experience that most modern seek not only provide clarify and relate human yearn value ideal and purpose it also provide facility and incitement for the development of personality sociality and creativeness under the religious impulse whether theistic or humanistic men have joy in live life lead somewhere religion at it best be out in front ever beckon and lead on and a lippman put it mobilize all man s scatter energy in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance at the same time that religion bind the individual helpfully to the supernatural and give him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also have great therapeutic value for him it give him aid comfort even solace in meet mundane life situation where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill be felt by him to be inadequate he be confront with the recurrent crisis such a great natural catastrophe and the great transition of life marriage incurable disease widowhood old age the certainty of death he have to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie his religious belief provide him with plausible explanation for many condition which cause him great concern and his religious faith make possible fortitude equanimity and consolation enable him to endure colossal misfortune fear frustration uncertainty suffer evil and danger religion usually also include a principle of compensation mainly in a promise perfect future state the belief in immortality where hold function a a redress for the ill and disappointment of the here and now the tension accompany a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sin or some torment secret be relieve for the less self contain or self sufficient by confession repentance and penance the feel of individual inferiority defeat or humilation grow out of various social situation or individual deficiency or failure be compensate for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly but all victorious father god a well a by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith and by opportunity in religious act for give vent to emotion and energy in provide for these inner individual function religion undertake in behalf of individual peace of mind and well be service for which there be no other institution in addition to the function of religion within man there have always be the out social function for the community and society the two have never be separable religion be vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation the value system of a community or society be always correlate with and to a degree dependent upon a more or less share system of religious belief and conviction the religion support re enforce reaffirm and maintain the fundamental value even in the unite state with it freedom of religious belief and worship and it vast denominational differentiation there be a general consensus regard the basic christian value this be demonstrate especially when there be awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere for example american rally to christian value vi a vi those of atheistic communism in america also all of our major religious body officially sanction a universalistic ethic which be reflective of our common religion even the non church member the freewheeler marginal religionist and so on have the value of christian civilization internalize in them furthermore religion tend to integrate the whole range of value from the high or ultimate value of god to the intermediary and subordinate value for example those regard material object and pragmatic end finally it give sanctity more than human legitimacy and even through super empirical reference transcendent and supernatural importance to some value for example marriage a a sacrament much law break a sinful occasionally the state a a divine instrument it place certain value at least beyond question and tamper closely relate to this function be the fact that the religious system provide a body of ultimate end for the society which be compatible with the supreme eternal end this something lead to a conception of an over all social plan with a mean interpretable in term of ultimate end for example a plan that fulfill the will of god which advance the kingdom of god which involve social life a part of the grand design this explain some group end and provide a justification of their primacy it give social guidance and direction and make for program of social action finally it give mean to much social endeavor and logic consistency and mean to life in general there be no society so secularize a to be completely without religiously inspire transcendental end religion integrate and unify some of the old most persistent and most cohesive form of social grouping have grow out of religion these group have vary widely from mere family primitive totemic group and small modern cult and sect to the membership of great denomination and great widely disperse world religion religion foster group life in various way the common ultimate value end and goal foster by religion be a most important factor without a system of value there can be no society where such a value system prevail it always unify all who possess it it enable member of the society to operate a a system the belief of a religion also reflect the value be express in creed dogma and doctrine and form what durkheim call a credo a he point out a religious group can not exist without a collective credo and the more extensive the credo the more unify and strong be the group the credo unify and socialize men by attach them completely to an identical body of doctrine the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group the religious symbolism and especially the closely relate rite and worship form constitute a powerful bond for the member of the particular faith the religion in fact be an expression of the unity of the group small or large the common cod for religious action a such and in their ethical aspect for everyday moral behavior bind the devote together these be way of jointly participate in significantly symbolize standardize and order religiously sanctify behavior the cod be mechanism for train in and direct and enforce uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reassert the solidarity of the group durkheim note long ago that religion a a unify system of belief and practice relative to sacred thing unite into one single moral community all those who adhere to them his view be that every religion pertain to a community and conversely every community be in one aspect a religious unit this be bring out in the common religious ethos that prevail even in the denominationally diverse audience at many secular semi public and public occasion in the unite state and it be evidence in the prayer offer in the frequent religious allusion and in the confirmation of point on religious ground the unify effect of religion be also bring out in the fact that historically people have cling together a more or less cohesive cultural unit with religion a the dominant bond even though spatially disperse and not politically organize the jew for year have be a prime example though the adherent of any world or interpeople religion be case in point it might be point out that the integrate function of religion for good or ill have often support or be identify with other grouping political nationality language class racial sociability even economic religion usually exercise a stabilize conserve function a such it act a an anchor for the people there be a mark tendency for religion once firmly establish to resist change not only in their own doctrine and policy and practice but also in secular affair have religious relevance it have thus be a significant factor in the conservation of social value though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new one it tend to support the longstanding precious sentiment the traditional way of think and the customary way of live a yinger have point out the reliance on symbol on tradition on sacred write on the cultivation of emotional feel of identity and harmony with sacred value turn one to the past far more than to the future historically religion have also function a a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction and perpetuation of various other institution at the same time that religion exercise a conserve influence it also energize and motivate both individual and group much of the important individual and social action have be owe to religious incentive the great ultimate end of religion have serve a magnificent beacon light that lure people toward them with an almost irresistible force mobilize energy and induce sacrifice for example the crusade mission effort just war much effort have be expend in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonition of religion the insuperable reward system that most religion embody have great motivating effect religion provide the most attractive reward either in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by it norm but who engage in good work religion usually act a a powerful aid in social control enforce what men should or should not do among primitive people the sanction and dictate of religion be more bind than any of the other control exercise by the group and in modern society such influence be still great religion have it own supernatural prescription that be at the same time cod of behavior for the here and now

worthy of his attention but immediately satisfy them by take him on his lap along with the twin say i have a big lap there be room for you too johnnie simultaneously a variety of environmental support a calm but not too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent use of nurse care accompaniment to the well baby clinic for medical advice on the twin feed problem combine to prevent far development of predictable pathological mechanism follow up visit of the nurse and social worker indicate continue success in the care of the new baby a well a a mark improvement in the family s day to day mental health and social function a see in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance the lack of awareness usually spring from deep but disguise anxiety often assume the superficial guise of not know or not care the unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handle through the medium of a positive control transference in general the approach be more active than passive more out reach than reflective while some regression be inevitable it be discourage rather than encourage so that the transference do not follow the stage of plan regression associate with certain casework adaptation of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy to establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately preferably within the first interview by meet the client s specific need these need usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension the initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information seek sense in this relationship build stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client s ability to deal with the problem in so do he implicitly offer the positive contagion of hope a a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feel of helplessness and hopelessness generally associate with the first stage of stress impact thus the client receive enough ego support to engage in constructive effort on his own behalf here there be a specific preventive component which apply in a more generalize sense to any casework situation we be prevent or averting pathogenic phenomenon such a undue regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of denial and cripple guilt turn against the self while some suppression and some denial be not only necessary but healthy the worker s clinical knowledge must determine how these defense be be use what healthy shift in defensive adaptation be indicate and when effort at bring about change can be most effectively time in steering the family toward ego adaptive and away from maladaptive response the worker us time honor focus casework technique of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve week the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth between immediate external stressful exigency precipitate stress and the key emotionally relevant issue underlie problem which be often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivate by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution though there be obviously nothing new about these technique they do challenge the worker s skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessment then too the utmost clinical flexibility be necessary in judiciously combine carefully time family orient home visit single and group office interview and appropriate telephone follow up call if the worker be to be genuinely accessible and if the predict unhealthy outcome be to be actually avert in accordance with the principle of preventive intervention in addition in many case a variety of concrete social resource homemaker day care medical and financial aid must be reasonably available for the reality support need to bolster the family in it individual and collective cop and integrative effort at certain critical stage and only for sound diagnostic reason it may be important to accompany family member in their use of these resource if their problem solve behavior be to be constructive rather than defeat while expensive in time and involve a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker in term of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client s life technique of accompaniment be find to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objective finally whatever the technique use a twin goal be common to all preventive casework service to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family member to mobilize and use their ego capacity have outline an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we now address ourselves to our final question what place should brief crisis orient preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of service we should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of value locate brief treatment at the bottom and long term intensive service at the top instead of see the service a part of a continuum each important in it own right this problem be perhaps a old a social casework itself almost three decade ago bertha reynolds undertake a study of short contact interview because of her conviction that short term casework have an important but neglect place in our network of social service her conclusion have be bear out in the experience of many practitioner short contact interview be neither a truncate nor a telescope experience but be of the same essential quality a the so call intensive case work thus casework involve a limit number of interview be still to be regard in term of the quality of service render rather than of the quantity of time expend that we be experience an upsurge of interest in the many formulation and preventive adaptation of brief treatment in social casework be evident from even a small sampling of current literature especially noteworthy be levinger s find that the length of treatment per se be not a reliable indicator of successful outcome accord to a number of study the important predictor be the nature and management of the client s anxiety a well a the accessibility of the help person for example the level of improvement note in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent child relationship problem compare favorably with the result report by typical child guidance clinic where the hour spend in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hour devote to actual treatment interview in the experimental project of startle significance too be the assertion that it be possible to carry out this program with only a percent attrition rate a compare with a rate of percent report for a comparable group of family who be receive help in traditionally operate child guidance service these report refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approach by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people similarity to the approach which i have describe be evident in the prompt establishment of a help relationship quick appraisal of key issue and the immediate mobilization of treatment plan a the essential dynamic in help to far the ego s cop effort in deal with the interplay of inner and out stress while there be many different possibility for the time of casework intervention the experiment recently report from a variety of traditional setting all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client s initial need for help in some program treatment be concentrate over a short period of time while in others after the initial contact be establish flexible spacing of interview have be experimentally use with apparent success willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation with the proviso that if the interpretation be too threaten the worker can withdraw be another prominent feature in these effort my aim in mention this factor obviously be not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage u to use the time honor clinical casework skill we already possess and to use them with great confidence precision and professional pride though there be obviously great need for continue experimentation with various type of short term intervention to far effort in develop an operational definition of prevention at the secondary or perhaps in some instance primary level the place of short term intervention have already be document by a number of investigator in a wide variety of setting woodward for example have emphasize the need for a broad spectrum of service include very brief service in connection with critical situation ideally brief treatment should be arrive at a a treatment of choice rather than a a treatment of chance moreover the shortage of treatment resource and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force u to innovate additional refinement of preventive intervention technique to make service more widely available and on a more effective basis to more people far research in the mean of crisis a experience by the consumer of traditional social casework service include attempt to develop a typology of family structure crisis problem reaction mechanism and differential treatment approach and the establishment of new experimental program be imperative social need which should command the best effort of caseworker in collaboration with community planner our literature be already replete with a fantastic number of suggestion for preventive agency programming range from the immediately practical to the globally utopian probably in the immediate future we will have to settle for middle range effort that fall short of utopian model increase experimentation with multipurpose agency especially those that combine afresh the traditional function of family and child welfare service hold rich promise for the future for example child welfare experience abound with case in which the parental request for substitute care be precipitate by a crisis event which be meaningfully link with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationship
cj25,cj25,informative,learned,2292,sentiment tension management and communication of sentiment be the process involve in the function of the element of sentiment or feel one of the device for tension management be preferential mat the preferential mat of this particular population have be analyze in a separate study the relative geographical isolation of the brandywine population make for a limit choice in mat it would seem necessary that member of this population provide support for one another since it be not provide by the large society the supportive relation can apparently be achieve in geographical and social isolation the newlywed build home on the same land with either set of parent and the almost exclusive use of member of the population a sponsor for baptism and wedding illustrate this supportive relationship a loomis remark in the internal pattern the chief reason for interact be to communicate like friendship and love among those who stand in support relation to one another and correspond negative sentiment to those who stand in antagonistic relation achieve maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today yet the object of the element of achieve through the process of goal attain for this population appear to have be change by circumstance bring about by the war prior to world war there be a high percentage of endogamous marriage than after world war norm the norm a element refer to all criterion for judge the character or conduct of both individual and group action in any social system the process of evaluation assign vary positive and negative priority or value to element the element and process become evident in a study of mate selection in this population from the evidence it may be conjecture that core core marriage be the prefer union for core male and female core marginal marriage still belong in the category of permissive union and core negro marriage be proscribe for core member status role the element of status role and associate process have not be sufficiently investigate for this population to permit any type of conjecture about them power there be some indication from a limit number of interview with member of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary influence of non authoritative power have be exert on actor in the system particularly in regard to mate selection this would seem to vary from family to family depend somewhat on the core or marginal status of that family again size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group control rank interview with member of the brandywine population be attempt in order to discover the rank of the various family in the population the large majority of the interviewee place core family in the upper position loomis consider rank a product of the evaluation process the stand or rank of an actor in a give social system be determine by the evaluation place upon the actor and his act in accordance with the norm and standard of the system despite the increase rate of exogamous marriage the population have be able to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of it intermediate status in society to some extent the system can be consider a gemeinschaft in which social role occupancy be determine by birth by attribute such a sex or caste which be biologically or socially immutable the adherence of many in the population to the indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestor have never be slave become of prime interest in determine how far these element promote the self image of the intermediate status of the group in society sanction the negative sanction apply to core negro marriage for core member act a indicator of expect adherence to group norm however because of church law lately more stringently enforce which forbid the marriage of cousin closely relate consanguineously a mean of facilitate the goal of in group relation may be that of recourse to illegitimate union a cursory survey of available material indicate a high rate of illegitimate birth occur to parent who have a close consanguineous relationship subsystem the comprehensive or master process activate all or some of the element within the social system and subsystem within the large social system be the structural and functional subsystem the structural subsystem consist of relatively stable inter relationship among it part include subgroup of various type interconnect by relational norm role of various type within the large system and within the subgroup regulative norm govern subgroup and role cultural value in the study of marriage pattern for this group consanguinity produce the structural system a system of affinity which in turn maintain the system of consanguinity subgroup of various type have be find within this system each family line can be consider a substructure there seem to be an imply cultural value attach to the fact of core status within the group additionally the proscription of core negro marriage for core family discuss above would seem to act a a regulative norm govern subgroup and role the scope of this study do not provide for the study of role of various type within the large system or within the subgroup however it can not be presume informal though the structure of the population seem that there be not well define role within the system the present study relate to the theory of functional system it be hypothesize that fertility be a function of the social system when the population a a whole be consider and a function of the subsystem when the two fold division of core family and marginal family be consider the four functional problem of a social system be to some extent solve by the subsystem within this population by mean of geographical isolation and high fertility rat inbreeding can be foster and the pattern of isolation from the great society maintain in order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility rate provide more group member for mate selection and the cluster of member in group foster acceptance of group control to maintain their intermediate position in the large society it be not only necessary that member of this population be visible but that their number be great enough to be recognize a a separate distinct grouping or system in society a mention above where family be concentrate in large number group control seem strong and most effective adaptation to the social and non social environment through the economy have be meet to a degree through a type of occupational segregation this provide the necessary contact with the large society while support a type of control over member in term of social contact integration have to do with the inter relation of part the problem of solidarity and morale again involve the concept of value the value place by the brandywine population upon maintain a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial identity and therefore a certain separate social status be important for the morale of the system since morale be closely relate to pattern maintenance and integration the high the morale and solidarity the well the system can solve the problem of the system in this respect it would seem that the great the social distance between the brandywine population and the white and negro population within the same general locality the great the possibility for high morale and solidarity within the brandywine population it be conceive that one of the mean to attain this social distance be that of physical and social isolation in turn high fertility rat for this population provide a mean of increase the numerical quantity of the population allow for the possibility of great stability and unity the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow large master process of particular utility in the analysis of the development persistence and change of social system have be the use of the master or comprehensive process loomis consider six such process in his paradigm communication boundary maintenance systemic linkage socialization social control institutionalization though undoubtedly all six process be operative within the whole social system and it subsystem two process that be of crucial importance to this study will be single out for particular emphasis communication in discuss the process of communication loomis define it a the process by which information decision and directive be transmit among actor and the way in which knowledge opinion and attitude be form or modify by interaction communication may be facilitate by mean of the high visibility within the large community intense interaction be easy where segregate live and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community a in the case of this population however the factor of physical isolation be not a static situation although the brandywine population be still predominantly rural there be indication of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the old and relatively isolate rural community urbanization appear to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group this conclusion be however an over simplification a more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urban fringe area be in general less segregate locally than group member in rural area in the urban area in other word they unlike some urban ethnic group do not concentrate in ghetto colony group pressure toward conformity be slight or non existent and deviant behavior in mate selection incur few if any social sanction in such a set social contact and association be likely to be heterogamous result in a change of value and almost necessarily in mate selection behavior to the extent that urban life contribute to the breakdown of the group pattern of residential isolation to that extent it contribute directly to increase exogamy social control the process of social control be operative insofar a sanction play a part in the individual s behavior a well a the group s behavior by mean of this social control deviance be either eliminate or somehow make compatible with the function of the social group example from this population indicate that deviance seem to be sanction by ostracism from the group socialization there be an oral tradition among the member of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the large society confuse and divide though this tradition may be it be an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and act a a mean of socialization particularly for member of the rural community the fact of indian ancestry and free status during the day of slavery be important distinction make by member of the group boundary maintenance culturally induce social cohesion result from common norm and value internalize by member of the group be operative in the boundary maintenance of the group a well a in the process of socialization the process of boundary maintenance identify and preserve the social system or subsystem and the characteristic interaction be maintain a the threat of encroachment on the system increase the probability of apply boundary maintenance mechanism increase the fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintain the boundary increase boundary maintenance may be achieve for example by assign a high primacy or evaluation to activity characteristic of the external pattern the external pattern or external system can be consider a group behavior that enable the group to survive in it environment boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social a be the preference for endogamy it be also express in the proscription against deviant in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural area by their pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core family and the marginal family show distinct limit to the intergroup contact they maintain systemic linkage where boundary maintenance describe the boundary or limit of the group systemic linkage be define a the process whereby one or more of the element of at least two social system be articulate in such a manner that the two system in some way and on some occasion may be view a a single unit

but the information on the dynamic of population be often quite mislead the same system with minor modification be develop in ruanda urundi under belgian administration here again it seem that useful approximation of the size and geographical distribution of the population be obtain in this way in the late pre war and early post war period before consider more recent activity we should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa a number of strong independent agency establish in some case with governmental or royal support have conduct large medical social educational and research operation in particular part of the congo and ruanda urundi the work of fonds reine elisabeth pour l assistance medicale aux indigene du congo belge foreami have special interest with respect to demography this agency accept responsibility for medical service to a population range from person in to in in the kwango district and adjacent area east of leopoldville each year from on it medical staff have conduct intensive field investigation to determine change in population structure and vital rat and a it primary objective the incidence of major disease it find be report each year in it rapport sur l activite pendant annee bruxelles somewhat similar investigation have be make by medical officer in other area other independent or partially independent agency have promote investigation on topic directly or indirectly relate to demography these study vary widely in scope and precision l institut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale irsac have sponsor well design field investigation and have cooperate closely with the government of ruanda urundi in the development of it official statistic a massive investigation of the characteristic of in migrant and prospective out migrant in ruanda urundi be be carry on by j j maquet former director of the social science branch of irsac now a professor at l universite officielle du congo belge et du ruanda urundi some complete schedule with item collect by sub chief in circumscription have be tabulate the result be now be analyze statistic have be recognize a a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda urundi during the post war year in connection with long term economic and social program the aimo organization of both country which maintain administrative service throughout the territory retain immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information however the statistical office of both government be assign responsibility for the plan and analysis of these statistic a bureau de la demographie a romaniuk director be form under aimo in the congo to work in close rapport with the section statistique of the secretariat general eventually responsibility for demographic inquiry in the congo be transfer to the demographic division of the central statistical office the demographic inquiry in ruanda urundi be direct by v neesen a member of the irsac staff though the inquiry be carry out under the auspex of aimo which have continue responsibility for demographic statistic in this territory a member of the irsac staff e van de walle be recently delegate to cooperate with aimo in the development of demographic statistic in this territory the initiation of sampling census in ruanda urundi and in the congo be major advance we will deal first with the program in the congo though this be put into operation late than the other the radical nature of the innovation in the congo be not emphasize in the official announcement the term enquetes demographiques previously use for the supplementary investigation carry out in connection with the administrative census be use for the new investigation however the difference in procedure be fundamental these be a follow field work procedure field operation be transfer from administrative personnel primarily engage in other task to specially train team of full time african investigator three team each work in two province these team carry out the same operation successively in different area nature of the sample sample area in the new investigation be select strictly by application of the principle of probability theory so a to be representative of the total population of define area within calculable limit in short scientific sampling be introduce in place of subjective sampling the population of the various district or other major division be stratify by type of community rural urban mix and where appropriate by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy sample unit village in rural area house in city be draw systematically within these stratum size of the sample different sampling ratio be apply under different condition high proportion be sample in urban and mix community than in rural area about percent of the total population be cover in the new investigation a compare with about percent in the previous inquiry question and definition uniform question definition and procedure be enforce throughout the whole country data be obtain separately on three class of person a resident present b resident absent and c visitor in the report summary result be give for both the de facto a and c and de jure a and b population but the subsequent analysis of characteristic be report only for the de jure population or in some district only the de facto population these change represent in effect a shift from an administrative compilation of data obtain through procedure design primarily to serve political and economic objective to a systematic sampling census of the whole african population the population registration system still have important function it supply local data which be useful in administration and which can be use a a basis for intensive study in particular situation it provide a frame for the sampling census it also provide a frame within which the registration of vital event be gradually gain force though one can not expect to obtain reliable vital statistic in most part of the congo from this source in the near future it be still use in make current population estimate in post census year though the value of these estimate be open to question finally it may have certain very important less obvious value even though the register may have an incomplete record of person present in a particular area or include person no long live there they contain precise information on age by date of birth for some of the person present especially child in relatively stable community and supplementary information such a record of marital status for many others the quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improve by the use of the registration record in conjunction with the field inquiry furthermore it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method a distinguish from sampling error in each of these source on such subject a fertility mortality and migration during a give interval by use information from two largely independent source in conjunction the first sampling census in the congo extend over a three year period the result be still be process in it be plan to double the number of team and to make use of improve equipment in a second demographic inquiry in so that the inquiry can be carry through in one year and the result publish more expeditiously it be propose that in the future complete sampling census be carry out at five year interval report already issue on the sampling census in various area run a follow use only the french and omit correspond flemish title this report contain preliminary note and table other report in identical form but with somewhat vary content have be issue these area report will be follow accord to present plan by a summary report which will include a detail statement on method
cj27,cj27,informative,learned,2257,with this evidence in mind the writer begin to plan how he might more effectively educate the marry student in his functional class toward the end of the semester s work he interview every marry class member at great length he find a he have suspect a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally design course be not really functional for these student however all admit that the hindsight be not altogether lose in their own word it have aid them to get a clear picture of how they have get into their marriage and perhaps they have obtain some insight on why certain trouble appear from time to time in fact they go so far a to caution the writer that if he attempt to design a section exclusively for marry student there should be at the begin some hindsight study but they all hasten to add that certainly less time be need on it than presently spend all of them felt a compel need for more coverage on area that could be only lightly touch upon in a general survey functional course a few be doubtful about the merit of an exclusive section for marry student a one of them express it it have do me a world of good to listen to the naive question and comment of these not yet marry people i can now well see just what process provoke certain action from me in the past have i be in an all marry section i would have miss this and i believe that this single aspect have be of great personal value to me this comment and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification for continue the status quo but the weight of feel be heavily in the opposite direction thus the writer decide to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of exclusively for person already marry that be prerequisite marriage this do not mean that marry student could not enroll in other mix section and some of them largely because of schedule difficulty do but only those already marry could enroll in this one section in addition two other difference in the two type of section must be note the regular section do not allow freshman this one do this action be rationalize on the basis of a small survey which indicate that a high percentage of marry freshman woman on our campus never become sophomore many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another by permit freshman student we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individual who otherwise might never get to take it this have subsequently be verify by the experience auditor be encourage in the regular section they have always be more or less discourage the philosophy have be that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively besides auditor do not count on faculty load with the same weight a regularly enrol student but in this one section we welcome auditor why for no particular reason other than that the writer felt it might just might encourage both mate to be in attendance many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially in the various engineering field with few elective till the senior year incidentally it need to be note that because auditor be permit the section begin increase in number each week until at last it swell to such proportion that this free audit policy have to be retract after that we begin to get visitor to class this experimental class represent quite a variety of student it range from a freshman woman just marry through the various academic growth stage include one senior graduate student to a young faculty member recently marry to a senior man who also attend it range from those with no child through student in various stage of pregnancy to one year old male with four child three of whom be teenager it range from two woman member who have experience premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve year marry and seemingly unable to conceive one might digress at this point and speculate that if it be wise to create special section for special status then why not a special section for woman pregnant before marriage and one for year old men with teenage child and so on some of these speculation may have some merit others be somewhat ambiguous but few who have experience marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationship be different in marriage than in a pre marital situation the writer begin this special class by explain his background think for create such a section in the first place he make it clear from the begin that this be the student opportunity and that the future destiny of such group depend on favorable result from this one he do build a framework of academic respectability and one which do not encroach upon the sacred sovereignty of any other exist campus course this be to say that this be not a course in wise buy or money spend method nor a course in how to raise child we already have course cover those problem and so on but within that framework he allow for a much flexibility a possible a steering committee of student be organize on the first day whose duty it be to be alert and constantly evaluate and re evaluate the direction and pace the class be take the writer be cognizant through his interview of the reaction of previous marry student do insist on there be include some hindsight material but the great part of semester time be actually center around the attitude so we be marry now how do we make the best of it or how do we enrich our already fine marriage film be use a with all section but with one big difference our campus unfortunately own no film since they be all either rent or borrow the request date for their use have to be far in advance the writer never know from week to week just where the section might be for example the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be drop for an additional week a there be still too much of it untouched since the writer have establish this democratic procedure in the begin he have to go along with their decision after of course point out whether he think their decision be a wise or an unwise one thus the film see a they come in coordinate for the regular section be often out of context nevertheless the writer have never experience such spontaneity of discussion after film show though it do not become know to the writer for some time a nucleus group have spring up within the class they begin to meet in the evening and carry forward various discussion they felt not fully enough cover in class from a few student this group gradually increase to include over three fourth of those officially enrol in the class and many outsider a well also although only a few of the student be intimately acquaint with each other in the begin most report that when the semester end their dearest and close campus friendship be with member of that class in fact they often revamp their social activity to include class member previously unknown supplemental outside read report be handle just a in the other section the major difference be that there be a noticeably deep level in the report outside read by the marry group these student although they might read various article in popular magazine more often choose to report on article find in the journal in addition to the noticeable difference in outside article there be a considerable difference in the outside book they read whereas a high percentage of the regular student can be expect to read other text which more or less plow the same grind in a little different direction the marry student choose whole book on specific area and go into much great detail in their area of interest since the writer have not notice this characteristic in marry student scatter throughout the various section previous to this experiment nor a a matter of fact in those who be continue in single section he can only conclude that there must have be something contagious within the specific group which cause this to occur in the main this course take the follow directional high road a great deal of time be spend on process for solve marital difference this be not a search for a magic formula but rather an examination of basic principle pertain especially to all type of communication in marriage in short it be center around learn how to develop a more sensitive empathy not until the group be satisfy in this area be they will to venture far to specific adjustment area such a sex in law religion finance and so on from here they proceed to these same area in relation to their own future family life stage develop these to the extent of examine various crisis which could be expect to confront them at some time or other a an example of this last facet there be some lengthy discussion center around bereavement mainly these be concern with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of live with the survivor afterward but the possible death of one s own spouse be not overlook since the course one member have lose her husband this be not a particularly shock or unexpected thing it be previously know to her that it might happen but just when be an unknown and of course the long it do not happen the strong her wish and belief that it might not since her bereavement this individual have report to the writer on numerous occasion about how helpful the class discussion be to her in this adjustment crisis quite frequently class member bring question from their mate at home these be often carefully write out with a great deal of think behind them this add a personal zest to class discussion and participation both sex report that the discussion on sex adjustment within marriage be extremely enlighten the writer sense a much free and more frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before he felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understand that orgasm a a criterion be not nearly so essential for a satisfy female sexual experience a most male might think this be probably much more meaningful because all the woman in the class emphasize it time and again on the other hand the woman class member appear to reach a far great understand than have woman member in other section that it be more natural for male a a group to view sex a sex rather than always associate it with love a most woman seem to do in the reproductive area it could be readily observe that all felt free to discus thing than student have previously in mix marital status section perhaps this be relate to the fact that all be in on it to some extent never in other section have there be the opportunity for the genuine down to earth discussion about the feel of both spouse during various stage of pregnancy there be a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy be represent from a childless couple to and include every trimester in fact we have one birth before the end of the course and another student have to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the safe side there be also one spontaneous abortion during the semester
cj28,cj28,informative,learned,2243,thus it be reasonable to believe that there be a significant difference between the two group in their performance on this task after a brief structure experience it be predict that kohnstamm negative subject would adhere to more liberal concretistic report of what the ambiguous figure look like a reflect their hesitancy about take chance this be true mostly of those kohnstamm negative subject who do not perceive the ambiguous figure a people in action response such a rope with a loop in it and two piece of rope be quite characteristic guilford martin personality inventory the three personality inventory guilford guilford martin guilford martin be fill out by of the kohnstamm positive subject and of the kohnstamm negative subject these be the same subject who be give the rorschach test some prediction have be make concern factor r n i and co on these inventory which appear to be directly relate to control and security aspect of personality function which be hypothesize a be of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity only co differentiate between the two group at less than the level af one prediction have be make about the difference in security or self confidence between those subject who shift their kohnstamm reactivity when inform and those who do not the nonreactors have be separate into two group on this assumption with the presumably secure nonreactors and secure reactor be use a the group for comparative personality study it be predict that those who shift in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who do not on the factor i which the investigator refer to a the inferiority factor all of the subject in the kohnstamm negative and kohnstamm positive group a define for purpose of the personality study be compare with those subject who shift in condition or a t test on these two group shifter v nonshifters give a t value of which be significant on the two tail test at the level discussion individual difference individual difference in kohnstamm reactivity to control kohnstamm situation be find among the subject use in the study only subject give a positive kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concern the phenomenon there be subject who do not give a positive reaction even after they be inform of the normalcy of such a reaction and have be give a demonstration there be subject who shift from a negative to a positive reaction after they be reassure a to the normalcy of the kohnstamm positive reaction among this latter group there be also difference in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occur one subject change when give only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax five subject do not change until they have be tell that some people have something happen to their arm what that something be and also be give a demonstration four subject do not change even then but need the additional information that an arm elevation under these circumstance be a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people show while others do not at no time be it imply by the experimenter that the subject s initial reaction be deviant the subject be only give information about other possibility of normal reaction those who respond with an arm elevation in the naive state do not change their reaction when tell that there be some normal people who do not react in this fashion this information be accept with the frequent interpretation that those person who do not show arm levitation must be prevent it these subject imply that they too could prevent their arm from rise if they try the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition the naive state be not adequately explain by such a concept a suggestibility if suggestibility be define a the influence on behavior by verbal cue in no way either verbally or behaviorally do the experimenter indicate to the subject any prefer mode of respond to the voluntary contraction moreover when the experimenter do inform those subject that there be some normal people who do not have their arm rise once they relax the kohnstamm positive subject be uninfluenced in their subsequent reaction to the kohnstamm situation they continue to give an arm elevation a differential suggestibility would have to be invoke to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the kohnstamm positive reactor and yet attribute their naive kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion autosuggestibility the reaction of the subject in such a way a to conform to his own expectation of the outcome i e that the arm rise be a reaction to the pressure exert in the voluntary contraction because of his knowledge that to every reaction there be an equal and opposite reaction also seem inadequate a an explanation for the follow reason the subject apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arm rise and manifestation of the phenomenon despite anticipation of something else happen e g of become dizzy and maybe fall an expectation spontaneously volunteer by one of the subject a suggestion hypothesis also seem inadequate a an explanation for those who shift their reaction after they be inform of the possibility of normal reaction different from those which they give while they be tell that there be some normal people who react differently than they have they be also inform that there be other normal who react a they have there be no implication make that their initial reaction absence of an arm elevation be less prefer than the presence of levitation a more tenable explanation for the change in reaction be that the add knowledge and increase familiarity with the total situation make it possible for these subject to be less guard and to relax since any reaction seem acceptable to the examiner a normal the naive state condition could therefore be view a an inhibit one for of the subject in this study they be not free to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there be an observer of their reaction and they have no guide for acceptable behavior instruction to relax i e to be spontaneous and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have be not sufficiently reassure until some idea of the possibility of normal reaction have be give while other condition might be even more effective in bring about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm reactivity it be our hypothesis that all such condition would have a a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enable him to divorce himself temporarily from feel of responsibility for his behavior alcohol ingestion succeed in change immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject the only one with whom this technique be try this subject who have be undergo psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five year do not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardize condition use in this experiment while sober after two drink contain alcohol her arm fly upward very freely there be evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement she describe herself a have the same kind of irresponsible feel a she have once experience under hypnosis she ascribe her delight with both experience to the effect they seem to have of temporarily remove from her the control which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these control many subject attribute difference in kohnstamm reactivity to difference in degree of subjective control voluntary a the kohnstamm positive subject perceive it and involuntary a the kohnstamm negative subject perceive it these suggest interpretation be give by the subject spontaneously when they be tell that there be people who react differently than they have the kohnstamm positive subject describe the vivid experience of have their arm rise a one in which they exercise no control they explain it absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factor they felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they have once experience the reaction some of those who do not initially react with an arm elevation also associate their behavior in the situation with control factor an inability to relinquish control voluntarily one subject spontaneously ask after her arm have finally rise do you suppose i be unconsciously keep it down before another say that her arm do not go up at first because i wouldn t let it i think it wasn t suppose to this subject be one who give an arm elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first she have felt that her arm want to go up in the first trial but have consciously prevent it from so do she explain nonreactivity of others by say that they be not let themselves relax when inform that there be some person who do not have their arm go up she comment i don t see how they can prevent it in contrast to this voluntary control explanation for nonreactivity give by the kohnstamm positive subject the kohnstamm negative subject offer an involuntary control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity they felt that they be relax a much a they could and that any control factor which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level the above discussion do not mean to imply that control factor be completely in abeyance in the kohnstamm positive subject but rather that they could be diminish sufficiently not to interfere with arm levitation one kohnstamm positive subject who have both arm rise while be test in the naive condition describe her subjective experience a follow you feel they re go up and you re on a stage and it s not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that s what s suppose to happen she then describe her experience a one in which she first have difficulty accept for herself a state of be in which she relinquish control however she be able to relax and yield to the moment it be our hypothesis that kohnstamm positive subject be less hesitant about relinquish control than be kohnstamm negative subject that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactor rather than actor it be our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control be evidence by the kohnstamm positive subject in some of the other experimental situation to be discuss below thus this readiness to relax control evidence in the kohnstamm situation appear to be a more general personality factor aniseikonic illusion the kohnstamm positive subject seem to be free to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world there be a significantly great number in this group who report a desk a be in a tilt position while a tennis ball rest on it remain stationary on the incline this occur in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be go downhill they know that their perceptual experience differ from objective reality since they have see the desk and ball prior to put on the aniseikonic lens yet they be not so bind by past experience and constriction a to deny their immediate perception and to be dominate by their knowledge of what the experience should be the change in perception by some of the kohnstamm negative subject after they have be inform of the possibility of normal reaction suggest that their constriction and guardedness be associate with their general mode of respond to strange or unknown situation they be able to experience at first in term of past conventionality when inform a to the various possibility of normal reaction they be then able to experience the uniqueness of the present it might be postulate that these subject be unduly afraid of be wrong that they perceive new internal and environmental situation a threaten until they be test and prove otherwise while the interpretation that have be give be inference only they gain support from such comment a the follow which be make by one of the kohnstamm negative subject who do not on the first trial perceive the tilt illusion
cj29,cj29,informative,learned,2230,control of socioeconomic status it would have be desirable for the two community to have differ only in respect to the variable be investigate the degree of structure in teaching method the structure school be in an industrial city with three family tenement house typical of the residential area but with one rather sizable section of middle class home the unstructured school be in a large suburban community predominantly middle to upper middle class but fringe by an industrial area in order to equate the sample on socioeconomic status we choose school in both city on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhood school principal and guidance worker make rat of the various neighborhood and the research team make independent observation of house and dwell area an objective scale be develop for rat school neighborhood from these data equal proportion of child in each city be draw from upper lower and lower middle class neighborhood subject individual difference in maturation and the development of readiness for learn to read indicate that not until the third grade have most child have ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement therefore third grade child be chosen a subject for this study for purpose of sample selection only individual test be give late we obtain group test score of read achievement and intelligence from school record of the entire third grade population in each school system the subject for this study be randomly select from stratify area of the distribution one third a underachiever one third medium and one third over achiever child whose read score be at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third grade school population be consider under achiever for the purpose of sample selection over achiever be at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system the final sample be not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to read achievement or intelligence test score twenty four classroom in twelve unstructured school furnish case boy and girl eight classroom in three structure school furnish case boy and girl administrative restriction necessitate the small sample size in the structure school it be assume that the sampling procedure be purely random with respect to the personality variable under investigation rat scale of compulsivity an interview schedule of open end question and a multiple choice questionnaire be prepare and one parent of each of the sample child be see in the home the parent be ask to describe the child s typical behavior in certain standard situation in which there be an opportunity to observe tendency toward perfectionism in demand upon self and others irrational conformity to rule orderliness punctuality and need for certainty the interviewer be instruct not to suggest answer and a much a possible to record the parent actual word a they describe the child s behavior in home situation the rat scale of compulsivity be construct by first perusing the interview record categorize all evidence relate to compulsivity then arrange a distribution of such information apart from the case record final rat be make on the basis of a point system which be develop after study the distribution of actual behavior record and assign weight value to each type of behavior that be deviant from the discover norm child score high in compulsivity be those who give evidence of tension or emotionality in situation where there be lack of organization or conformity to standard and expectation or who make exaggerate effort to achieve these goal the low compulsive child be one who appear relatively unconcerned about such matter for instance the follow statement be rat low in compulsivity she s naturally quite neat about thing but it doesn t bother her at all if her room get messy but she clean it up very well when i remind her measurement of anxiety castaneda et al revise the taylor anxiety scale for use with child the taylor scale be adapt from the minnesota multiphastic personality inventory with item selection base upon clinical definition of anxiety there be much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiate individual who be likely to manifest anxiety in vary degree reliability and validation work with the child s anxiety scale by castaneda et al demonstrate result closely similar to the find with the adult scale although the taylor scale be design a a group test device in this study it be individually administer by psychologically train worker who establish rapport and assist the child in read the item relationship of anxiety to compulsivity the question may be raise whether or not we be deal with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity the two rat yield a correlation of which be not significantly different from zero therefore we have measure two different characteristic in theory compulsive behavior be a way of diminish anxiety and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many child the obsessive compulsive defense be not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be take up late criterion measurement in the primary grade read permeate almost every aspect of school progress and the child s early experience of success or failure in learn to read often set a pattern of total achievement that be relatively endure throughout the follow year in establish criterion measurement it be therefore think best to broaden the scope beyond the read act itself the predict interaction effect should if potent extend it influence over all academic achievement the stanford achievement test form j be administer by classroom teacher consist of a battery of six sub test paragraph mean word mean spell language arithmetic computation and arithmetic reason all of these sub test involve read except arithmetic computation score be state in grade equivalent on a national norm the battery median grade equivalent be use in data analysis in this study the wechsler intelligence scale for child be administer to each sample third grade child by a clinical worker the relationship of intelligence test score to school achievement be a well establish fact in this case af therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis it be necessary to control this factor the criterion score use in the statistical analysis be an index of over or under achievement it be the discrepancy between the actual attain achievement test score and the score that would be predict by the i q for example on the basis of the regression equation a child with an i q of in this sample would be expect to earn an achievement test score of grade equivalent if a child with an i q of score in achievement his discrepancy score would be represent of one year of over achievement a child with an i q of would be expect to earn an achievement test score of if such a child score his discrepancy score would be represent of one year of under achievement in this manner the factor measure by the intelligence test be control allow discover difference in achievement to be interpret a result from other variable result test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching method table and present the result of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity be use a the descriptive variable figure portray the mean achievement score of each sub group graphically first of all a we have surmise the highly compulsive child in the structure set score significantly well af on achievement than do similar child in the unstructured school it can be see too that when we contrast level of compulsivity within the structure school the high compulsive child do well af no significant difference be find in achievement between high and low compulsive child within the unstructured school the hypothesis of there be an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method be support in this case at the level while we have expect that compulsive child in the unstructured school set would have difficulty when compare to those in the structure we be surprise to find that the achievement of the high compulsive within the school where the whole word method be use in begin read compare favorably with that of the low compulsive indeed their achievement score be somewhat well on an absolute basis although the difference be not significant we speculate that compulsive in the unstructured school be under great strain because of the lack of systemization in their school set but that their need to organize for comfort be so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rule and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment it be interest to note that medium compulsive in the unstructured school make the low achievement score although not significantly lower possibly their compulsivity be not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure our conjecture be then that regardless of the manner in which school lesson be teach the compulsive child accentuate those element of each lesson that aid him in systematize his work when help by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then do such a child attain unusual success test of interaction of anxiety and teaching method the statistical analysis of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching method and the interaction of the two be present in table and figure be a graph of the mean achievement score of each group a predict the highly anxious child in the unstructured school score more poorly af than those in the structure school the interaction effect which be significant at the level can be see best in the contrast of mean score while high anxiety child achieve significantly less well af in the unstructured school than do low anxiety child they appear to do at least a well a the average in the structure classroom the most strike aspect of the interaction demonstrate be the mark decrement in performance suffer by the highly anxious child in unstructured school accord to the theory propose this be a consequence of the severe condition of perceive threat that persist unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment the fact that such threat be potent in the begin read lesson be think to be a vital factor in the continue pattern of failure or under achievement these child exhibit the child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety release energy toward achievement but because his distress severely reduce the ability of discrimination and memorization of complex symbol the child may fail in his initial attempt to master the problem failure confirm the threat and the intensity of anxiety be increase a the require learn become more difficult so that by the time the child reach the third grade the decrement in performance be pronounce the individual with high anxiety in the structure classroom may approach the learn task with the same increase energy and lower power of discrimination but the symbol he be ask to learn be simple a show early the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorize of simple element success reduce the prospect of threat and his power of discrimination be improve by the time the child first attack the actual problem of read he be completely familiar and at ease with all of the element of word apparently academic challenge in the structure set create an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety be able to achieve because he be arouse to an energetic state without become confuse or panic sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation and that his performance will be impair unless he receive support and accept treatment from the teacher although the present study be not a direct replication of their investigation the result do not confirm their conclusion observer in the two school system study here judge the teacher in the structure school to be more

cj30,cj30,informative,learned,2267,analysis analysis mean the evaluation of subpart the comparative rat of part the comprehension of the mean of isolate element analysis in roleplaying be usually do for the purpose of understand strong and weak point of an individual or a a process to eliminate weak part and strengthen good part impersonal purpose up to this point stress have be place on roleplaying in term of individual roleplaying can be do for quite a different purpose to evaluate procedure regardless of individual for example a sale presentation can be analyze and evaluate through roleplaying example let u now put some flesh on the theoretical bone we have assemble by give illustration of roleplaying use for evaluation and analysis one should keep in mind that many of the excite possiblities of roleplaying be largely unexplored and have not be use in industry to the extent that they have be in military and other area evaluation the president of a small firm sell restaurant product have considerable difficulty in find suitable salesman for his business interview check reference train the salesman have them go with more experience salesman be expensive and the rate of attrition due to resignation or unsatisfactory performance be too high it be his experience that only one good salesman be find out of every seven hire and only one be hire out of every seven interview roleplaying be offer a a solution and the procedure work a follow all candidate be invite to a hotel conference room where the president explain the difficulty he have and how unnecessary it seem to him to hire people who just do not work out in place of ask salesman to fill questionnaire check their reference interview them ask them to be try out he tell them he would prefer to test them each person be to enter the test room carry a suitcase of sample each salesman be to read a sheet contain a description of the product in the test room he be to make successively three presentation to three different people in the test room three of the veteran salesman serve a antagonist one handle the salesman in a friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitate manner each be tell to purchase material if he felt like it the antagonist come in one at a time and do not see or hear the other presentation after each presentation the antagonist write his judgment of the salesman and so do the observer consist of the president three of his salesman and a psychologist ten salesman be test in the morning and ten more in the afternoon this procedure be repeat one day a month for four month the bat average of one success out of seven increase to one out of three the president of the firm calculate expense alone felt his cost have drop one half while success in selection have improve over one hundred per cent the reason for the value of this procedure be simply that the applicant be test at work in different situation by the judgment of a number of expert who could see how the salesman conduct themselves with different but typical restaurant owner and manager they be in a sense try out in realistic situation from the point of view of the applicant less time be waste in be evaluate and they get a meal out of it a well a some insight into their performance another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrate how this procedure can be use in real life situation without special equipment or special assistant during the daily course of work the position of receptionist be open in a large office and an announcement be make to the other girl already work that they could apply for this job which have high prestige and slightly high salary than type and clerking position all applicant be generally familiar with the work of the receptionist at the end of work one day the personnel man take the applicant one at a time ask them to sit behind the receptionist s desk and he then play the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of query and for a number of purpose each girl be independently test by the personnel man and he serve not only a the director but a the antagonist and the observer somewhat to his surprise he find that one girl whom he would never have consider for the job since she have appear somewhat mousy and also have be in the office a relatively short time do the most outstanding job of play the role of receptionist show wit sparkle and aplomb she be hire and be find to be entirely satisfactory when she play the role eight hour a day analysis in consider roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area since we be now no long deal with a simple over all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many element see in dynamic function some case in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure an engineer have be make the work manager of a firm supplanting a retire employee who have be consider outstandingly successful the engineer have more than seven year of experience in the firm be well train be consider a hard worker be respect by his fellow engineer for his technical competence and be regard a a comer however he turn out to be a complete failure in his new position he seem to antagonize everyone turnover rat of personnel go up production drop and morale be visibly reduce despite the fact that he be regard a an outstanding engineer he seem to be a very poor administrator although no one quite know what be wrong with him at the insistence of his own supervisor the president of the firm he enrol in a course design to develop leader he play a number of typical situation before observer other supervisor who keep note and then explain to him in detail what he do they think be wrong entirely concern with efficiency he be merciless in criticize people who make mistake condemn them to too great an extent he do not really listen to others have little interest in their idea and want to have his own way which be the only right way the entire group of manager explain in great detail a number of human relation error that he make one by one these error be discuss and one by one he reject accept them a error he admit his behavior and defend it he refuse to change his approach and instead he attack high and low the official for their not back him and subordinate for their laxness stupidity and stubbornness after the diagnose he leave the course convince that it could do him no good we may say that his problem be diagnose but that he refuse treatment the engineer turn work manager have a particular view of life and refuse to change it we may say that his attitude be foolish since he may have be a success have he learn some human relation skill or we may say that his attitude be commendable show his independence of mind in his refusal to adjust to the opinion of others in any case he refuse to accept the implication of the analysis that he need to be make over another case may be give in illustration of a successful use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis in a course for supermarket operator a district manager who have be recently appoint to his position after be outstandingly successful a a store manager find that in supervise other manager he be have a difficult time on play some typical situation before a jury of his peer he show some characteristic rat a unsatisfactory he be tell he display for example a sense of superiority and he answer well i be suppose to know all the answer aren t i he be criticize for his curtness and abruptness and he answer i be not work to become popular on be criticize for his arbitrary behavior he answer i have to make decision that s my job in short a frequently happen in analysis the individual feel threaten and defend himself however in this case the district manager be lead to see the error of his way the necessary step between diagnosis and train be acceptance of the validity of the criticism how this be accomplish may be describe since this sometimes be a crucial problem the director help tailor make a check list of the district manager s error by ask various observer to write out sentence comment on the mistake they felt he make these error be then collect and write on a blackboard condense similar idea eighteen error be locate and then the director ask each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager have make the particular error they be ask to vote true if they think they have see him make the error false if they think he have not and can not say if they be not certain the manager sit behind the group so he could see and count the hand that go up and the director write the number on the blackboard no comment be make during the vote the result look a follow af the first eight of these eighteen statement which receive at least one half of the vote be duplicate to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager roleplay in other situation the member check any item that appear to prevent the manager from deliberately control himself only during the session they be rather lengthy about twenty minute the situation be imperfectly describe to the manager so that he would not know what to expect new antagonist be bring on the scene unexpectedly and the antagonist be instruct to deliberately behave in such way a to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he have be previously criticize after every session the check mark be total up and graph and in this way the supervisor s progress be chart summary in life we learn to play our role and we freeze into pattern which become so habitual that we be not really aware of what we do we can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see u well than we see ourselves to learn what we do be the first step for improvement to accept the validity of the judgment of others be the second step to want to change be the third step to practice new procedure under guide supervision and with constant feedback be the fourth step to use these new way in daily life be the last step roleplaying use for analysis follow these general step lead to train when an evaluative situation be set up and no concern be with the detail that lead to an over all estimate we say that roleplaying be use for evaluation observer can see a person engage in spontaneous behavior and watch him operate in a totalistic fashion this behavior be more veridical or true than other test behavior for some type of evaluation and so can give quick and accurate estimate of complex function while roleplaying for test be not too well understand at the present time it represent one of the major us of this procedure chapter spontaneity train the objective of this chapter be to clarify the distinction between spontaneity theory and other train concept in addition the basic approach utilize in apply roleplaying will be review the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrate rationale to aid him in apply roleplaying technique in this unique train area the reason for extract this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of train be twofold spontaneity train theory be unique and relatively new
cj31,cj31,informative,learned,2335,it be not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patient s communicate an introject have appear and be hold sway one learn to become alert to change in his vocal tone to his voice s suddenly shift to a quality not like his usual one a quality which sound somehow artificial or in some instance parrot like the content of his word may lapse back into monotonous repetition a if a phonograph needle be stick in one groove only seldom be it so simple a to be a matter of his obviously parrot some timeworn axiom common to our culture which he have evidently hear over and over from a parent until he experience it a part of him one hebephrenic woman often become submerge in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion during which despite her wrack sob and stream cheek i felt only a cold annoyance with her eventually such incident become more sporadic and more sharply demarcate from her day after day behavior and in one particular session after several minute of such behavior which a usual go on without any accompany word from her she ask eagerly do you see granny at first i do not know what she mean i think she must be see me a some one who have just come from see her grandmother in their distant home city then i realize that she have be deliberately show me this time what granny be like and when i reply in this spirit she corroborate my hunch at another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic mother introject begin to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she mutter in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside me i could evoke no far elaboration from her about this but a few second late she be stand directly across the room from me look me in the eye and say in a scathingly condemnatory tone your father despise you again i at first misconstrue this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast through my mind to account for her be able to speak with such utter conviction of an opinion hold by my father now several year deceased then i reply coldly if you despise me why don t you say so directly she look confuse at this and i felt sure it have be a wrong response for me to make it then occur to me to ask be that what that woman tell you she clearly agree that this have be the case i realize now that she have be show me in what impress me a be a very accurate way something her mother have once say to her it be a if she be show me one of the reason why she hat that woman inside her what have be an unmanageably powerful introject be now despite it continue charge of energy disconcert to me sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introject mother be like early this woman have be so fill with a chaotic variety of introject that at time when she be in her room alone it would sound to a passerby a though there be several different person in the room a she would vocalize in various kind of voice a somewhat less fragment hebephrenic patient of mine who use to often seclude herself in her room often sound through the close door a i would find on pass by between our session for all the world like two person a scold mother and a defensive child particularly hard for the therapist to grasp be those instance in which the patient be manifest an introject traceable to something in the therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter be himself only poorly aware and the recognition of which a a part of himself he find distinctly unwelcome i have find time and again that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rest in the final analysis on this basis and only when i can acknowledge this to myself a be indeed an aspect of my personality do it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient s behavior for example one hebephrenic man use to annoy me month after month by say whenever i get up to leave and make my fairly steoreotyped comment that i would be see him on the follow day or whenever you re welcome in a notably condescend fashion a though it be his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spend the hour with him and he be thus point up my failure to utter a humbly grateful thank you to him at the end of each session eventually it become clear to me partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly that this man with his condescend you re welcome be very accurately personify an element of obnoxious condescension which have be present in my own demeanor over these month on each of these occasion when i have bid him good bye with the console note each time that the heal christ would be stoop to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow another patient a paranoid woman for many month infuriate not only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patient by arrogantly behave a though she own the whole build a though she be the only person in it whose need be to be meet this behavior on her part subside only after i have come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between on the one hand her arrange the ventilation of the common live room to her own like or turn the television off or on without regard to the wish of the others and on the other hand my own come stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objection bring my big easy chair with me usually shut the window of her room which she prefer to keep in a very cold state and plunk myself down in my chair in short behave a if i own her room condensation here a variety of mean and emotion be concentrate or reduce in their communicative expression to some comparatively simple seem verbal or nonverbal statement one find for example that a terse and stereotype verbal expression seem at first to be a mere hollow convention reveal itself over the month of therapy a the vehicle for express the most vary and intense feel and the most unconventional of mean more than anything it be the therapist s intuitive sense of these latent mean in the stereotype which help these mean to become reveal something like a spread out deck of card on sporadic occasion over the passage of the patient s and his month of work together one can not assume of course that all these accumulate mean be inherent in the stereotype at the begin of the therapy or at any one time late on when the stereotype be utter probably it be correct to think of it a a matter of a well groove stereotype mode of expression and no or but a few other communicational groove a yet be there available for the patient s use a newly emerge emotion and idea well up in him over the course of month but it be true that the therapist can sense when he hear this stereotype that there be at this moment many emotional determinant at work in it a blur babel of indistinct voice which have yet to become clearly delineate from one another sometimes it be not a verbal stereotype a how be you now or an i want to go home or whatever but a nonverbal one which reveal itself gradually a the condense expression of more than one latent mean a hebephrenic man use to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of time during his largely silent hour with his therapist when the therapist come to feel on sufficiently sure grind with him to ask him what be that bill hello or farewell the patient reply both dearie two in one of all the possible form of nonverbal expression that which seem best to give release and communicational expression to complex and undifferentiated feel be laughter it be no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiate of all schizophrenic patient show a one of his characteristic symptom laughter laughter which now make one feel scorn or hat which now make one feel like weeping or which now give one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man s despair and which more often than all these convey a welter of feel which could in no way be convey by any number of word word which be so unlike this welter in be form and discrete from one another to a much less full extent the hebephrenic person s belching or flatus have a comparable communicative function in work with these patient the therapist eventually get to do some at least private mull over of the possible mean of a belch or the passage of flatus not only because he be reduce to this for lack of anything else to analyze but also because he learn that even these animal like sound constitute form of communication in which from time to time quite different thing be be say long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these a distinct feel and concept to say them in word a i have be intimate in the schizophrenic and perhaps also in the dream of the neurotic this be a question which i have no wish to take up condensation be a phenomenon in which one find not a condense expression of various feel and idea which be at an unconscious level well sort out but rather a condense expression of feel and idea which even in the unconscious have yet to become well differentiate from one another freeman cameron and mcghie in their description of the disturbance of think find in chronic schizophrenic patient say in regard to condensation that the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment and the object contain therein in itself be the prototypical condensation in my experience a great many of the patient s more puzzle verbal communication be so for the reason that concrete mean have not become differentiate from figurative mean in his subjective experience thus he may be refer to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment by some symbolic sound hyperbolic reference to transcendental event on the global scene recently for example a paranoid woman s large scale philosophizing in the session about the intrusive curiosity which have become in her opinion a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture develop itself before the end of the session into a suspicion that i be surreptitiously peek at her partially expose breast a indeed i be or equally often a concretistic seem particularistic seem statement may consist with it mundane exterior in a form of poetry may be full of mean and emotion when interpret a a figurative expression a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speak of such hide mean the patient himself be more often than not entirely unaware his subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one one hebephrenic woman confide to me i live in a world of word a if to her word be fully concrete object burnham in his excellent article concern schizophrenic communication include mention of similar clinical material a borderline schizophrenic young man tell me that to him the various theoretical concept about which he have be expound in a most articulate fashion during session after session with me be like great cube of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him a he speak i be remind of the great bale of cargo which be swing high in the air from a dock steamship
cj32,cj32,informative,learned,2170,the many linguistic technique for reduce the amount of dictionary information that have be propose all organize the dictionary s content around prefix stem suffix etc a significant reduction in the voume of store information be thus realize especially for a highly inflect language such a russian for english the reduction in size be less strike this approach require that each text word be separate into small element to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entry and the information retrieve from several entry in the dictionary be synthesize into a description of the particular word the logical scheme use to accomplish the former influence the placement of information in the dictionary file implementation of the latter require storage of information need only for synthesis we suggest the application of certain data process technique a a solution to the problem but first we must define two term so that their mean will be clearly understand form any unique sequence of alphabetic character that can appear in a language precede and follow by a space occurrence an instance of a form in text we propose a method for select only dictionary information require by the text be translate and a mean for pass the information directly to the occurrence in text we accomplish this by compile a list of text form a text be read by the computer a random storage scheme base on the spell of form provide an economical way to compile this text form list dictionary form find to match form in the text list be mark a location in the computer store be also name for each mark form dictionary information about the form store at this location can be retrieve directly by occurrence of the form in text finally information be retrieve from the dictionary a require by stage of the translation process the grammatical description for sentence structure determination equivalent choice information for semantic analysis and target language equivalent for output construction the dictionary be a form dictionary at least in the sense that complete form be use a the basis for match text occurrence with dictionary entry also the dictionary be divide into at least two part the list of dictionary form and the file of information that pertain to these form a more detail description of dictionary operation text lookup and dictionary modification give a clear picture text lookup a we will describe it consist of three step the first be compile a list of text form assign an information cell to each and replace text occurrence with the information cell assign to the form of each occurrence for this step the computer memory be separate into three region cell in the w region be use for storage of the form in the text form list cell in the x region and y region be reserve a information cell for text form when an occurrence af be isolate during text read a random memory address af the address of a cell in the x region be compute from the form of af let af denote the form of af if cell af have not previously be assign a the information cell of a form in the text form list it be now assign a the information cell of af the form itself be store in the next available cell of the w region begin in cell af the address af and the number of cell require to store the form be write in af the information cell af be save to represent the text occurrence text read continue with the next occurrence let u assume that af be identical to the form of an occurrence af which precede af in the text when this situation exist the address af will equal af which be produce from af if af be assign a the information cell for af the routine can detect that af be identical to af by compare af with the form store at location af the address af be store in the cell af when a in this case the two form match the address af be save to represent the occurrence af text read continue with the next occurrence a third situation be possible the formula for computing random address from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form thus when more than one distinct form lead to a particular cell in the x region a chain of information cell must be create to accommodate the form one cell in the chain for each form if af lead to an address af that be equal to the address compute from af even though af do not match af the chain of information cell be extend from af by store the address of the next available cell in the y region af in af the cell af become the second information cell in the chain and be assign a the information cell of af a third cell can be add by store the address of another y cell in af similarly a many cell be add a be require each information cell in the chain contain the address of the y cell where the form to which it be assign be store each cell except the last in the chain also contain the address of the y cell that be the next element of the chain the absence of such a link in the last cell indicate the end of the chain hence when the address af be compute from af the cell af and all y cell in it chain must be inspect to determine whether af be already in the form list or whether it should be add to the form list and the chain when the information cell for af have be determine it be save a a representation of af text read continue with the next occurrence text read be terminate when a pre determine number of form have be store in the text form list this initiate the second step of glossary lookup connect the information cell of form in the text form list to dictionary form each form represent by the dictionary be look up in the text form list each time a dictionary form match a text form the information cell of the match text form be save the number of dictionary form skip since the last one match be also save these two piece of information for each dictionary form that be match by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage if each text form be mark when match with a dictionary form the text form not contain in the dictionary can be identify when all dictionary form have be read the appropriate action for handle these form can be take at that time each dictionary form be look up in the text form list by the same method use to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text read a random address af that lie within the x region of memory mention early be compute from the i th dictionary form if cell af be an information cell it and any information cell in the y region that have be link to af each contain an address in the w region where a potentially match form be store the dictionary form be compare with each of these text form when a match be find an entry be make in the table of dictionary usage if cell af be not an information cell we conclude that the i th dictionary form be not in the text list these two step essentially complete the lookup operation the final step merely us the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertain to each form match in the text form list and us the list of information cell record in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text the list of text form in the w region of memory and the content of the information cell in the x and y region be no long require only the assignment of the information cell be important the first stage of translation after glossary lookup be structural analysis of the input text the grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieve from the dictionary to permit such an analysis a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieve from the dictionary and attach to each text occurrence the grammatical description of all form in the dictionary be record in a separate part of the dictionary file the order be identical to the order of the form they describe when entry be be retrieve from this file the table of dictionary usage indicate which entry to skip and which entry to store in the computer this selection rejection process take place a the file be read each entry that be select for storage be write into the next available cell of the aj the address of the first cell and the number of cell use be write in the information cell for the form the address of the information cell be also supply by the table of dictionary usage when the complete file have be read the grammatical description for all text form find in the dictionary have be store in the w region the information cell assign to each text form contain the address of the grammatical description of the form it represent hence the description of each text occurrence can be retrieve by read the list of text order information cell address and output the description indicate by the information cell for each occurrence the only requirement on dictionary information make by the text lookup operation be that each form represent by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the form this leave the order of entry variable here an entry be a form plus the information that pertain to it two very useful way for modify a form dictionary be the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigm rather than single form and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form the former be intend to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage the latter be useful for modify information about some or all form of a word hence reduce the work require to improve dictionary content apply the technique develop at harvard for generate a paradigm from a representative form and it classification we can add all form of a word to the dictionary at once an extension of the principle would permit enter a grammatical description of each form equivalent could be assign to the paradigm either at the time it be add to the dictionary or after the word have be study in context thus one can think of a dictionary entry a a word rather than a form if all form of a paradigm be group together within the dictionary a considerable reduction in the amount of information require be possible for example the inflect form of a word can be represent insofar a regular inflection allow by a stem and a set of ending to be attach indeed the set of ending can be replace by the name of a set of ending the full form can be derive from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text form list similarly if the equivalent for the form of a word do not vary the equivalent need be enter only once with an indication that they apply to each form the dictionary system be in no way dependent upon such summarization or design around it when irregularity and variation prevent summarize information be write in complete detail entry be summarize only when by do so the amount of information retain in the dictionary be reduce and the time require for dictionary operation be decrease
cj33,cj33,informative,learned,2241,in sentence pattern of stress be determine by complex combination of influence that can only be suggest here the tendency be toward put dominant stress at the end there be a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long know hymn tune thus the first line of one of charles wesley s hymn be a follow a charge to keep i have a god to glorify in the tune to which this hymn be most often sing boylston the syllable have and fy ending their line have twice the time any other syllable have dominant stress be of course more than extend duration and normally center on syllable that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the word or long unit they be part of be speak alone a dominant stress give to glorify would normally center on it first syllable rather than it last but the parallel be significant when the answer to what s wrong now be bill s break a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair from the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement be the predicator have break and from the point of view of mean it would seem that the trouble center in the break but dominant stress will be assign to break only in rather exceptional version of the sentence in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know in small town people be very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly in the double sentence the small the town the friendly the people it will generally be on the subject the town and the people in what s a linguist dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist in who s a linguist it will generally be on the complement a linguist dominant stress be on her luggage both in that s her luggage where her luggage be the complement and in there s her luggage where it be the subject adverbial second complement however be likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentence if the answer to what be that noise be george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement the cat not the second complement out final adjunct may or may not have dominant stress if the answer to what be that noise be george read the news emotionally dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally when prepositional complement be divide a in what be you look for they be likely to lose dominant stress context be of extreme importance what be new in the context be likely to be make more prominent than what be not thus in a context in which there have be discussion of snow but mention of local condition be new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snow here but in a context in which there have be discussion of local weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snow the personal pronoun and substitute one be normally unstressed because they refer to what be prominent in the immediate context in i ll go with george dominant stress be probably on george but if george have just be mention prominently and the trip to be make have be under discussion what be say be probably i ll go with him and dominant stress be probably on the preposition with when a gesture accompany who s he the personal pronoun have dominant stress because he have not be mention previously if both george and a piece of information george do not have be prominent in the context but the idea of tell george be new then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell george but when what be new in a particular context be also fairly obvious there be normally only light stress or no stress at all thus the unstressed it of it rarely snow here get it significance from it use with snow nothing can snow snow but it in there aren t many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young take dominant stress away from it head people the fact that the young creature of interest be people seem rather obvious if woman replace people it would normally have dominant stress in i have thing to do the word thing make little real contribution to mean and have weak stress than do if work be substitute for thing with more exact contribution to mean it will have dominant stress in i know one thing dominant stress be likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing in i know you when you be a child and you be pretty then dominant stress on then imply that the young woman speak to be still pretty dominant stress on pretty would be almost insult here in the write language then can be underline or italicize to guide the reader here but much of the time the write language simply depend on the reader s alertness and a careless reader will have to back up and reread often dominant stress simply indicate a center of attention or emotion thus in it s incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress be likely to be on incredible and eat will have strong stress also in she have it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily be on in where the notion of store up antipathy seem to center in we re painting at our garage strong stress on at indicate that the job be do be not real painting but simply an effort at painting where there be comparison or contrast dominant stress normally operate to center attention thus in his friend be stranger than his sister strong stress be normal for his and sister but in his friend be stranger than his sister strong stress be normal for friend and sister in he s hurt himself more than he s hurt you both himself and you have strong stress than they would ordinarily have if there be no contrast in be she chinese or japanese the desire to contrast the first part of word which be alike in their last component produce an exceptional disregard of the normal pattern of stress of chinese and japanese sometimes strong stress serve to focus an important secondary relationship thus in mary write an account of the trip first strong stress on mary mark mary a the first in a series of people who write account of the trip strong stress on write mark the write a the first of a series of action of mary s concern with an account of her trip about which she may late have make speech for example and strong stress on trip make the trip the first of a series of subject about which mary write account in hunger stimulate man too the situation be very similar strong stress on hunger treat hunger a an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulate treat stimulation a an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treat man a an additional creature who respond to the stimulation of hunger here again in the write language it be possible to help the reader get his stress right by use underline or italic but much of the time there be simply reliance on his understand in the light of context when a word represent a large construction of which it be the only express part it normally have more stress than it would have in fully express construction thus when yes i have be the response to have you finish read the paper the stress on have which here represent have finish read the paper be quite strong in mack s the leader at camp but jack be here the be of the second main declarative represent be the leader and therefore have stress mack s the leader at camp but jack s here with this be deprive of stress make here the complement in the clause in of all the suggestion that be make his be the silliest the possessive his represent his suggestion and be stress when go represent itself and a complement be equivalent say to go to martinique in which boat do jack go on it have strong stress when it represent only itself and on which be it complement so that go on be semantically equivalent to board on have strong stress than go do omission of a subordinator pronoun however do not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object thus to have light stress both in that be the conclusion that i come to and in that be the conclusion i come to but when to represent to consciousness in that be the moment that i come to and similarly in that be the moment i come to there be much strong stress on to in i want to tell him but i be afraid to the final to be lightly stress because it represent to tell him in to tell him of course to be normally unstressed when i have instruction to leave be equivalent in mean to i have instruction that i be to leave this place dominant stress be ordinarily on leave when the same sequence be equivalent in mean to i have instruction which i be to leave dominant stress be ordinarily on instruction it be clear that pattern of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the speak language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the write other example follow i ll come by tuesday i can t be happy long without drink water in the first of these sentence if by be the complement of come and tuesday be an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong stress on by in the speak language but if a complement for come be imply and by tuesday be a prepositional unit use a an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stress at most in the second sentence if drink water be a gerundial clause and without drink water be roughly equivalent in mean to unless i drink water there will be strong stress on water than on drink but if drink be a gerundial noun modify water and without drink water be equivalent to without water for drink there will be strong stress on drink than on water but the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example can undermine distinction such a these and pattern of stress be not always unambiguous by any mean in the steiner have busy life without visit relative only context can indicate whether visit relative be equivalent in mean to pay visit to relative or to relative who be visit them and in i look up the number and i look up the chimney only the mean of number and chimney make it clear that up be syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition follow by it object in the second syllabification syllable be linguistic unit center in peak which be usually vocalic but a have be note be consonantal under certain circumstance and which may or may not be combine with precede and or follow consonant or combination of consonant syllable be genuine unit but division of word and sentence into them present great difficulty sometimes even the number of syllable be not clear doubt on this point be strong before l and aab or r from the point of view of word formation real might be expect to have two syllable historically re be the formative that be employ also in republic and al be the common suffix when ity be add real clearly have two syllable but there be every reason to regard deal a a monosyllable and because of the fact that l commonly have the quality of aab when it follow vowel sound deal seem to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with deal
cj34,cj34,informative,learned,2208,it be obvious enough that linguist in general have be less successful in cop with tone system than with consonant or vowel no single explanation be adequate to account for this improvement however be urgent and at least three thing will be need the first be a wide range sample of successful tonal analysis even begin student in linguistics be make familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant system both in their general outline and in many specific detail an advance student have read a considerable number of description of consonantal system include some of the more unusual type by contrast even experience linguist commonly know no more of the range of possibility in tone system than the over simple distinction between register and contour language this limit familiarity with the possible phenomenon have severely hamper work with tone tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of system be familar to every practice field linguist paper like these four if widely read will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work the second need be well field technique the great majority of present day linguist fall into one or more of a number of overlap type those who be convince that tone can not be analyse those who be personally scar of tone and tone language generally those who be convince that tone be merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those language where it occur those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter the result have be neglect fumble effort or superficial treatment a these malady overlap so must the cure analysis such a these four will simultaneously combat the assumption that tone be impossible and that it be simple they will give suggestion that can be work up into field procedure good field technique will not only equip linguist for well work but also help them overcome negative attitude actually none of these paper say much directly about field technique but it be worth ponder that very little have be publish on any phase of field technique in linguistics these thing have be disseminate by other mean but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic result the third need be for well theory we should expect that general phonologic theory should be a adequate for tone a for consonant and vowel but it have not be this can only be for one of two reason either the two be quite different and will require totally different theory and hence technique or our exist theory be insufficiently general if a i suspect the problem be largely of the second sort then development of a theory well able to handle tone will result automatically in well theory for all phonologic subsystem one issue that must be face be the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystem since tone system typically comprise few unit than either consonant or vowel system we might expect that they would be the easy part of a phonologic analysis actual practice do not often work out this way tone system be certainly more complex than the number of unit would suggest and often analytically more difficult than much large consonantal system welmers have suggest one explanation tone language use for linguistic contrast speech parameter which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable the problem be to disentangle the linguistic feature of pitch from the co occur nonlinguistic feature of course something of the same sort occur with other sector of the phonology consonantal articulation have both a linguistic and an individual component but in general the individual variation be a small thing add onto basic linguistic feature of great magnitude with tone individual difference may be great than the linguistic contrast which be superimpose on them pitch difference from one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far exceed the small difference between tone however any such suggestion account for only some of the difficulty in hearing tone or in develop a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic difficulty that occur even when tone be meticulously record a second explanation be suggest by the material describe in rowlands paper tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed neither can be adequately systematize until we be able to separate the two and assign the observe phenomenon individually to one or the other other pair of phonologic subsystem also interact or overlap in this way for example duration sometimes figure in both the vowel system and the intonation some phonetic feature for example glottal catch or murmur be sometimes to be assign to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual system but no other two phonologic system be a difficult to disentangle a be tone and intonation in some language this explanation of tone difficulty however do not apply in all language in some the ewe type mention above interaction of tone and intonation be restrict to the end of intonation span in many of the syllable intonation can be safely ignore and much of the tonal analysis can be do without any study of intonation still even in such language tone analysis have not be a simple a one might expect a third explanation be suggest by richardson s analysis of sukuma tone there we see a basically simple phonemic system enmesh in a very complex and puzzle morphophonemic system while the phoneme can be very easily state no one be likely to be satisfy with the statement until phonemic occurrence can be relate in some way to morphemic unit i e until the morphophonemics be work out or at least far enough that it seem reasonable to expect success in the typical tone language tonal morphophonemics be of the same order of complexity a consonantal morphophonemics the phonemic system which must support these morphophonemic system however be very different the inventory of tone be much small and commonly the contrast range along one single dimension pitch level consonantal system be not merely large they be multidimensional morphophonemic rule may be think of a join certain point in the system the possibility in the consonantal system be very numerous and only a small portion of them be actually use phoneme connect by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimension of contrast in the system tonal morphophonemics in a common case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone the possibility be few and the total number of rule may be considerably great often therefore there be a number of rule have the same effect and commonly other set of rule a well have the opposite effect tonal morphophonemics be much more confuse to the begin analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number of rule be no great the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology be an inverse function of the size small system be more troublesome for any give degree of morphophonemic complexity this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulty of tonal analysis a well a the fact that vowel system be often more puzzle than consonantal system the statement of the system be a different matter small system can of course be state much more succinctly a phonemic system can be state without reference to morphophonemics but it can not always be find without morphophonemics and the more complex the morphophonemic system be in relation to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analyse without close attention to the morphophonemics at least the less satisfy will a phonemic statement be if it can not be relate through morphophonemic rule to grammatically meaningful structure the design of orthography have receive much less attention from linguist than the problem deserve there have be a tendency on the part of many american linguist to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of secure acceptance this seem naive most others have be content to give only the most general attention to the broad and most obvious feature of the phonology when design orthography apparently the feel be that anything more would be involvement in technical abstruseness of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affair the result of this attitude have be the domination of many orthography conference by such consideration a typographic esthetic which usually turn out to be nothing more than certain prejudice carry over from european language many of the suggest system seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structure that they purport to represent linguist have not always be more enlighten than practical people and sometimes have insist on incredibly trivial point while neglect thing of much great significance a a result many people have be confirm in their conviction that orthography design be not an activity to which expert can contribute anything but confusion a e sharp in vowel length and syllabicity in kikuyu examine one set of relate orthographic question and it phonologic background in detail his objective be merely to determine what distinction of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography to do so he find it necessary to examine the relevant part of the phonology thoroughly and in detail in the process he develop some very significant observation about problem of a sort that be often difficult a few of his example be of very great interest and the whole discussion of some importance for theory his orthographic recommendation be no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other rather he weigh each phonologic fact in the light of it orthographic usefulness he conclude that some change can be make in the current orthography which will appreciably improve it usefulness but hesitate to suggest precise graphic device to effect these change i hope his suggestion be give the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circle this however will not exhaust their practical usefulness a they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design we need many more study of this sort if the design of write language be to be put on a sound basis one other paper deal with a phonologic problem vowel harmony in igbo by j carnochan this restate the already widely know fact in term of prosody a a restatement it make only a small contribution to knowledge of igbo but it would seem more intend a a tract advocate the prosodic theory than a paper direct to the specific problem of igbo phonology the paper have a certain value a a comparatively easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treat a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it be possible to compare it with a more traditional though not structural statement it do show one feature of the system that have not be previously describe but it do not a it claim demonstrate that this could not be treat by traditional method it seem to me that it rather easily can five of the paper deal with grammatical problem on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they be much more difficult to discus in detail because of their wide variety of subject matter my comment must be briefer than the paper deserve w h whiteley write on the verbal radical in iraqw this must be consider primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a short description of item category in iraqw it exhibit much the same descriptive technique and be open to much the same criticism the treatment seem unnecessarily loose joint and complex largely because the method be lax and the analysis seem never to be push to a satisfactory or even a consistent stop point
cj35,cj35,informative,learned,2401,there be more stem per item in athabascan which express the fact that the athabascan language have undergo somewhat more change in diverge from proto athabascan than the yokuts language from proto yokuts this may be because the athabascan divergence begin early or again because the athabascan language spread over a very much large territory include three wholly separate area or both the differentiation however be not very much great a show by the fact that athabascan show stem per mean slot a against for yokuts with a slightly great number of language represent in our sample a against on deduction of one eighth from the stem item rate become against in equivalent number of language these general fact be mention to make clear that the total situation in the two family be similar enough to warrant comparison the greatest difference in the two set of figure be due to difference in the two set of list use these difference in turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabulary be build up of term select mainly to insure unambiguity of english mean between illiterate informant and myself within a compact and uniform territorial area but that hoijer s vocabulary be base on swadesh s second glottochronological list which aim at eliminate all item which might be culturally or geographically determine swadesh in short be try to develop a basic list that be universal i one that be specifically adapt to the san joaquin valley the result be that i include animal name but swadesh only and somewhat similarly for plant a against swadesh and therefore hoijer felt compel to omit all term denote specie or even genus ox vulture salmon yellow pine manzanita their class of animal and plant term be restrict to generalization or recurrent part fish bird tree grass horn tail bark root the group be therefore really non comparable in content a well a in size other class be include only by myself interrogative adverb or only by swadesh and hoijer pronoun demonstrative what we have leave a reasonably comparable be four class body part and product which with a proportionally nearly even representation term out of out of come out with nearly even ratio and nature term against ratio versus adjective term ratio versus verb term ratio versus it will be see that where the scope be similar the athabascan ratio come out somewhat high a indeed they ought to with a total ratio of a against or except for verb where alone the athabascan ratio be lower this exception may be connect with hoijer s use of a much high percentage of verb of his total list a against in mine or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb more word class ratio determine in more language will no doubt ultimately answer the question if word class differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within mean slot it be conceivable that individual mean also differ with fair consistence trans lingually hoijer s athabascan and my yokuts share identical mean with allowance for several near synonym like stomach belly big large long far many much die dead say speak for yokuts i tabulate these item in five column accord a they be express by and more than stem the total for these five category be not too uneven namely respectively for athabascan with a great range of stem the first two of five correspond column be identical and stem the three others have to be spread somewhat and be head respectively af af and af stem while the particular limit of these grouping may seem artificially arbitrary they do fairly express a correspond grouping of more variable material and they eventuate also in five class along a similar scale contain approximately equal number of case namely in athabascan when now we count the frequency of the item in the two language family appear in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or two or three or four we find these difference af this distribution can be summarize by average the distance in grade apart af which divide by af give a mean of grade apart if the distribution of the item be wholly concordant in the two family the distance would of course be if it be wholly random and unrelated it would be assume the five class be equal in n which approximately they be the actual mean of be about halfway between of complete correlation and of no correlation it be evident that there be a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual item of mean a regard long term stem displacement in david d thomas publish basic vocabulary in some mon khmer language al no pp which compare mon khmer language with the i e language data on which swadesh base the revise retention rate af in place of original af and his revise word basic glottochronological list in towards great accuracy ijal thomas find be first that the individual item vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence but second that the semantic group be surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence a between m k and i e his first conclusion on behavior of individual item be negative whereas mine on ath and yok be partially positive his second conclusion on semantic word class agree with mine this second conclusion independently arrive at by independent study of material from two pair of language family a different and remote from one another a these four be can not be ignore thomas also present a simple equation for derive an index of persistence which weight not only the number of stem root per mean but their relative frequency thus his persistence value for some stem frequency per mean be stem identical in language stem frequency and stem frequency and stem frequency and his formula will have to be weigh may be alter or improve and it should be test on additional body of material but consideration of the frequency of stem per constant mean seem to be establish a have significance in comparative situation with diachronic and classificatory relevance and gleason presumably be on the way with a far contribution in this area a to relative frequency of compete root v etc thomas with his weight seem to be the first to have consider the significance this might have the problem need far exploration i be at least conscious of the distinction in my full yokuts presentation that await publication in which in list two stem mean i set off by asterisk those form in which n of stem b be af of stem a the unasterisked one stand for af or under four stem i set off by asterisk case where the combine n of stem af be af these find and others which will in time be develop will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry if adjectival mean show relatively low retentiveness of stem a i be confident will prove to be the case in most language of the world why should our basic list include per cent of these unstable form but only per cent of animal and plant which replace much more slowly have hoijer substitute for his adjectival slot good animal and plant item his rate of stem replacement would have be lower and the age of athabascan language separation small and irrespective of the outcome in century elapse since split calculation obviously carry more concordant and comparable mean if they deal with the most stable unit than with variously unstable one it be evident that swadesh have not only have much experience with basic vocabulary in many language but have acquire great tact and feel for the expectable behavior of lexical item why then this urge to include unstable item in his basic list it be the urge to obtain a list a free of geographical and cultural condition a possible and why that insistence it be the hope of attain a list of item of universal occurrence but it be become increasingly evident that such a hope be a snare not that such a list can not be construct but the near it come to attain universality the less significant will it be linguistically it term will tend to be labile or vague and they will fit actual language more and more badly the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics be the establishment of a basic list of item of mean against which the particular form or term of language can be match a the medium of comparison the most important quality of the mean be that they should be a definable a possible in proportion a mean be concrete we can well rely on their be insulate and distinctive an elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious common sense indubitable identity a do an eye or tooth or nail they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence and they should be give priority in the basic list a long a they continue to show these quality with the universal list a his weapon swadesh have extend his march of conquest far and far into the past eight ten twelve millennium back and he have proclaim great or less affiliation between all western hemisphere language some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence but the far out he move the thin will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the large the speculative component in his inference he have traverse province and kingdom but he have not consolidate them behind him nor do he control them he have announce result on hokan penutian uto aztecan and almost all other american family and phylum and have diagram their degree of interrelation but he have not work out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than salish that be his privilege the remote cloudy possible have value of it own value of scope stimulus potential and imagination but there be also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics the aspect of learn the internal organization of obvious natural genetic group of language a well a their more remote and elusive external link of classification first with elapse age merely a by product of acquire evidential knowledge of what happen in athabascan in yokuts in uto aztecan in the last few thousand year a well a forecast what more anciently may have happen between them this involve step by step progress and such will have to be the day by day work of lexicostatistics a a grow body of scientific inquiry if of the founder of glottochronology swadesh have escape our steady plodding and lee have repudiate his own share in the found that be no reason why we should swerve there be no apparent reason why we should feel bind by swadesh s rule and procedure since his predilection and aim have grow so vast it seem time to consider a revision of operational procedure for lexicostatistic study on a more humble solid and limit basis i would propose first an abandonment of attempt at a universal lexical list a intrinsically unachievable and operationally inadequate in proportion a it be achieve i would propose next a the prime requirement for constitution of new basic list item whose form show a high an empirical retention rate a possible there would be no conceivable sense in go to the opposite extreme of select item whose form be the most unstable an attempt middle course might lead to device like a word alphabetize dictionary from which every fiftieth word be select
cj36,cj36,informative,learned,2262,doubtless it be inevitable that difference of opinion should arise about the method for apply these policy it be nevertheless almost incredible that four year after yalta there should be a complete split over germany with hot head on both side plan to use the german against their former ally and with nazi mind german expect to recover their power by fight on one side or the other poland frontier when the yalta conference open the american policy of postpone all discussion of russia s western boundary until the peace conference have break down start in great force late in december from a line stretch from east prussia to budapest the red army have sweep two hundred mile across poland to the oder thirty mile from berlin and the upper danube region be be rapidly overrun while the western ally have not yet occupy all of the leave bank of the rhine the long delay in opening the second front be now work to russia s advantage the west be now glad to propose the curzon line which be substantially russia s border a the boundary between russia and poland when this proposal be make stalin speak with strong emotion than at any other time during the conference he stand up to emphasize his strong feel on the subject the bitter memory of russia s exclusion from the paris peace conference and of the west s effort to stamp out bolshevism at it birth boil up within him you would drive u into shame he declare the white russian and the ukrainian would say that stalin and molotov be far less reliable defender of russia than curzon and clemenceau yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accept the curzon line and even agree voluntarily that there should be digression from that line of five to eight kilometer in favor of poland in some region he do not mind the line itself which churchill declare in the house of common on february he have always believe to be just and right but he do not want it call by a hat name the west have long since forget the event of but it be not so easy for the red leader who felt that they have suffer great injustice in that period in the dunn atherton memorandum of february the state department have expect to be able to hold russia in check by withholding agreement to her boundary now stalin make it clear that he mean to move poland s western border deep into germany back to the western neisse oder river line take not only east prussia and all of silesia but pomerania and the tip of brandenburg back to and include stettin from six to nine million additional german would be evict though most would have flee and poland would receive far more from germany than the poor territory include the great pripet marsh which she lose to russia stalin declare that he prefer to continue the war a little long although it cost u blood in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense of the german by this time churchill be not so cordial toward move poland westward a he have be at teheran where he and eden have both heartily approve the idea after a prolong study of the oder line on a map at teheran churchill like the picture he would tell the pole he say that they have be give a fine place to live in more than three hundred mile each way at yalta he think more about the six million german who would have to leave try to find work in germany and roosevelt object to the western neisse river be chosen in the south instead of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder the issue be leave in abeyance presumably for the peace conference however there be no real question of the justice of create a strong poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large minority of german or russian the move of million of the german master race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room for the polish slav whom they have enslave and openly plan to exterminate be a drastic operation but there be little doubt that it be historically justify government of more importance to the west than poland s boundary be the character of her government at yalta the west still believe that eastern europe could be keep in it orbit in spite of the onrushing soviet army though little democracy have ever be practise in this region and much of it be still rule by feudalistic mean it be take for grant that at least the form of western democracy would be establish in this area and western capitalism preserve within it believe devoutly a they do in anglo saxon institution it be important to both roosevelt and churchill that the pole should have them the issue be acute because the exile polish government in london support in the main by britain be still compete with the new lublin government form behind the red army more time be spend in try to marry these incompatibles than over any subject discuss at yalta the result be an agreement that the lublin government should be reorganize on a broad democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leader from poland itself and from the pole abroad and pledge to hold free and unfettered election a soon a possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot all democratic and anti nazi party be to have the right to campaign roosevelt act a moderator of the long debate on this issue it be a matter of principle with churchill since britain have declare war in behalf of poland to stalin it be a matter of life and death he make this completely clear speak with great earnestness he say for the russian people the question of poland be not only a question of honor but also a question of security throughout history poland have be the corridor through which the enemy have pass into russia twice in the last thirty year our enemy the german have pass through this corridor it be in russia s interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force it be necessary that poland should be free independent in power therefore it be not only a question of honor but of life and death for the soviet state in other word the soviet union be determine to create a poland so strong a to be a powerful bulwark against germany and so closely tie to russia that there would never be any question of her serve a a cordon sanitaire against the soviet or pose a an independent balance power in between russia and germany byrnes say that invariably thereafter the soviet use the same security argument to justify their course in poland this reason be also a inevitable a anything could be any free election that be to be hold in poland would have to produce a government in which moscow have complete confidence and all pressure from the west for free vote by anti soviet element in poland would be meet by restriction on vote by these element liberate europe in even great degree the same rule apply to the remainder of eastern europe where the upper class have generally collaborate with the nazi even to the extent of send million of their peasant into russia a a part of hitler s army but at yalta the conflict expectation of east and west be merge into an agreement by the big three to assist all liberate country in europe to create democratic institution of their own choice in any case here in their judgment condition require italic add they would form interim governmental authority broadly representative of all democratic element in the population and pledge to the early possible establishment through free election of government responsive to the will of the people other similar affirmation in the declaration on liberate europe seem to assure democratic institution on the western model late it develop that the soviet have a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discuss late and their judgment never tell them that the big three should unite in establish democratic condition a we understand them within their zone of influence professor mcneill think that at yalta stalin do not fully realize the dilemma which face him that he think the exclusion of the anti soviet voter from east european election would not be greatly resent by his ally while neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly face the fact that in poland at least genuinely free democratic election would return government unfriendly to russia by any definition of international friendliness also war time propaganda and cooperation have obscure the difference between russian and western idea of democracy and it seem well to have them cover by verbal formula than to imperil the military victory over germany and japan the application of these formula could not please both side for they really attempt to marry the impossible to the inevitable while oblige to concede government in east europe allied with the soviet union instead of oppose to it we think we have preserve our social and economic system in east europe this illusion be describe in a far sight editorial in the new york herald tribune on march in connection with the submission of the satellite peace treaty to the senate in do so marshall and byrnes be ask for the ratification of a grim lesson in the fact of international life we have entertain exaggerate idea about our victory automatically establish our system throughout the world we be trouble about the fate of the baltic state yalta leave u with comfort illusion of a western capitalist democratic political economy reign supreme up to the curzon line and the border of bessarabia italic add this be a penetrate description of our post war illusion which apply to other area than east europe the same editorial continue that we expect to democratize japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily on our institution we expect in short that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple from such a position to deal with the localize aberration of the soviet union yet actually the image correspond in no way to the actuality of the post war world neither our military our economic nor our ideological power reach far enough to determine the fate of east europe then the editorial add prophetically how far they may reach in asia be yet undetermined but they fall far short of our dream of the war conference here be the best short explanation of the origin of the cold war that have be write fail to heed the lesson so clearly contain in the satellite treaty president truman re declare the cold war on march in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald tribune editorial be write and a year after the cold war have be announce by churchill at fulton missouri in truman s presence then china promptly go communist and mr truman have to fight the interminable korean war for the democratization of korea before we learn how far our writ do reach in asia year of war strain and hatred of heavy arm expenditure and constant danger of another world war have to ensue before the unite state could bring itself to accept the two chief result of world war communist control of east europe and china a new balance of power while the cold war rag it be easy to blame it all on yalta yet in summarize a series of careful essay on the yalta conference forrest pogue could find no basis for yalta become a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponent of roosevelt and international cooperation when the yalta paper be finally publish with great fanfare they have reveal no betrayal by anyone
cj37,cj37,informative,learned,2186,an analysis of the election fall naturally in four part first be the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation plan and discussion preparation begin slightly more than a year after independence with the first step to organize rural commune all political interest support electoral plan although there be some sign that the inherent uncertainty of a popular judgment lead to some procrastination the second major aspect of the election be the actual procedure of registration nomination and vote considerable technical skill be use and the administration of the election be generally above reproach however the regionally differentiate result which appear below in table be interest evidence of the problem of develop self government under even the most favorable circumstance a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy be the result of the election the electoral procedure prevent the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interest party include the government itself be busily engage in determine the party identification of all successful candidate the month follow the election the fourth and conclude point will be to estimate the long run significance of the election and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics election have figure prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence they be stress in the speech of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of minister be form and again when the istiqlal take a lead role in the second council king muhammad be know to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self government and make the first firm promise of election on may day there follow a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of election for the fall of in which it appear that the minister of the interior take the most pessimistic view and that the istiqlal be something less than enthusiastic since the complicate process of establish new commune and review the rudimentary plan leave by the french do not even begin until the fall of this goal appear somewhat ambitious from the very begin the electoral discussion raise fundamental issue in moroccan politics precisely the type of question that be most difficult to resolve in the new government until the charter of liberty be issue in the fall of there be no guarantee of the right to assemble or to organize for political purpose the istiqlal be still firmly unite in but the p d i parti democratique de l independance the most important minor party at the time object to the istiqlal s predominance in the civil service and influence in radio maroc there be rumor that the ministry of the interior favor an arbitrary non political process which be indirectly affirm when the king personally intervene in the plan meet the day follow his intervention the palace issue a statement reassure the citizen that the possibility of introduce appeal concern the establishment of electoral list list of candidate and finally the hold of the consultation itself would be support by the king himself the ifni crisis in the fall of postpone far consideration of election but french consultant be call in and notice of far investigation appear from time to time in january the minister of the interior announce that an election law be ready to be submit to the king the rumor of election date appear once again first for spring of and late for the summer although the government be probably prepare for election by mid the first decision be no doubt make more difficult a party strife multiply in late the m p mouvement populaire appear and in the spring of the internal strain of the istiqlal be reveal when the third council of government under balafrej be form without support from progressive element in the party the party be on the whole unprepared for election while the people be still experience post independence let down and suffer the after effect of poor harvest in despite the internal and international crisis that harass morocco the election remain a central issue they figure prominently in the balafrej government of may which the king be reportedly determine to keep in office until election could be hold but the eagerly seek homogeneity of the balafrej council of government be never achieve a the istiqlal quarrel over foreign policy labor politics and economic development by december when abdallah ibrahim become president of the council election have even great importance they be increasingly look upon a a mean of establish the new rural commune a the focus of a new constructive national effort to minimize the chance of repeat the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government be form a titre personnel and a special office be create in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the election by this time there be little doubt but what election plan be complete there remain only the delicate task of maneuver the law through the labyrinth of palace politics and make a small number of policy decision from the rather tortuous history of electoral plan in morocco an important point emerge concern the first election in a develop country and evaluate their result in the new country the electoral process be consider a a mean of resolve fundamental and sometimes bitter difference among leader and also a a source of policy guidance in the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organize political group hop that the election will give them new prominence but in a system where there be a yet no place for the less prominent lack the respect and effective institution that consensus help provide minority party such a the p d i in and the progressive istiqlal faction in clamor for election when out of power but be not at all certain they wish to be control by popular choice when in power those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process the tendency to treat election a an instrument of self interest rather than an instrument of national interest have two important effect on electoral plan in morocco at the central level the scrutin uninominal vote system be select over some form of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter have be recommend by duverger and favor by all political party the choice of the single member district be dictate to a certain extent by problem of communication and understand in the more remote area of the country but it also serve to minimize the national political value of the election although the election be for local official it be not necessary to conduct the election so a to prevent party from publicly identify their candidate with multiple member district the still fragmentary local party organization could have operate more effectively and party might have be encourage to state their position more clearly both party and the ministry of the interior be busily at work after the election try to unearth the political affiliation of the successful candidate and thereby give the election a confidential but know degree of national political significance since a national interpretation can not be avoid it be unfortunate that the election be not hold in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation the general set of the moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization the concentration of effective power in rabat lead not only to party bickering but to distraction from local activity that might have have many auxiliary benefit in addition to contribute to more meaningful election interest evidence can be find in the result of the chamber of commerce election which take place three week before national election the istiqlal sponsor u m c i a l union marocaine de commercants industrialistes et artisan be oppose by candidate of the new u n f p l union national de force populaires in nearly all urban center a the more conservative group with strong back from wealthy businessmen the u m c i a be generally favor against the more progressive labor base u n f p the new party campaign heavily while the old more confident party expect the moroccan merchant and small businessmen to support them a they have do for many year the local istiqlal and u m c i a office do not campaign and lose heavily the value of the election be lose both a an experiment in increase political participation and a a reliable indicator of commercial interest a show in table the chamber of commerce election be of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune election the u n f p learn that it urban organization which depend heavily on u m t support be most effective the istiqlal find that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle be not easily transpose to the more concrete precise problem of internal politics the overall effect be probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal election than might have otherwise take place a second major point of this essay be to examine the formal arrangement for the election although a somewhat technical subject it have important political implication a the above discussion of the vote system indicate furthermore the problem and solution devise in the electoral experience of the rapidly change country be often of comparative value and essential to evaluate election result the sine qua non of the election be naturally an impartial and standardize procedure a the background discussion indicate there be frequently express doubt that a government dominate by either party could fairly administer election the p d i and late the popular movement protect the istiqlal s privilege position until the fall of balafrej and then the istiqlal use the same argument which it have previously ignore against the pro u n f p tendency of the ibrahim government the bulk of the preparation have of course proceed under the supervision of the ministry of the interior whose official be bar from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics apart from some area of recur trouble like ban mellal where inexperienced official have be appoint there be little evidence that local official intervene in the electoral process centrally however the administrative problem be more complex and the sheer prestige of office be very likely an unfair advantage the king decide to remove ibrahim a week before election and to institute a non party council of government under his personal direction although the monarch have frequently assert that the election be to be without party significance his action be an implicit admission that party identification be a factor the new council be itself inescapably of political mean which be most clearly reveal in the absence of any u n f p member and the presence of several istiqlal leader since the detail of the election be settle the change of government have no direct effect on the technical aspect of the election and may have be more important a an indication of royal displeasure with the u n f p vote preparation begin in the fall of although the actual demarcation and plan for the rural commune be complete in there be three major administrative task the fix of electoral district the registration of voter and the registration of candidate voter registration begin in late november and continue until early january the government be most anxious that there be a respectable response periodic bulletin of the accomplishment in each province make the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial official a goal be fix a give in table and attention focus on it fulfillment the qualification to vote be keep very simple both men and woman of twenty one year of age could register and vote upon present proof of residence and identification there be liberal provision for dispensation where document or record be lack the police be disqualify along with certain category of naturalize citizen criminal and those punish for protectorate activity the registration figure give in table must be interpret with caution since the estimate for eligible elector be make without the benefit of a reliable census
cj38,cj38,informative,learned,2174,unemployed old worker who have no expectation of secure employment in the occupation in which they be skilled should be able to secure counseling and retrain in an occupation with a future some vocational train school provide such train but the current need exceed the facility current program the present federal program of vocational education begin in with the passage of the smith hughes act which provide a continue annual appropriation of million to support on a match basis state administer program of vocational education in agriculture trade industrial skill and home economics since some thirteen supplementary and relate act have extend this federal program the george barden act of raise the previous increase in annual authorization to million in addition to the million under the smith act the health amendment act of add million for practical nurse train the late major change in this program be introduce by the national defense education act of title of which amend the george barden act annual authorization of million be add for area vocational education program that meet national defense need for highly skilled technician the federal program of vocational education merely provide financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education program in public school the initiative administration and control remain primarily with the local school district even the state remain primarily in an assist role provide leadership and teacher train federal assistance be limit to half of the total expenditure and the state or local district must pay at least half the state may decide to encourage local program by pay half of the cost or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it throughout the history of the program state government expenditure in the aggregate have usually match or exceed the federal expenditure while local district all together have spend more than either federal or state government today federal fund account for only one fifth of the nation s expenditure for vocational education the greatest impact of the match fund principle have be in initially encourage the poor state and school district to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside fund national defense consideration have be the major reason behind most federal train expenditure in recent decade during world war about million person be enrol in course organize under two special program administer by state and local school authority vocational education for national defense and war production train the total cost of the five year program be million for the smith hughes george barden and national defense act of the cumulative total of federal expenditure in year be only about million no comparable measure be available of enrollment and expenditure for private vocational education train there be a great number and variety of private commercial school trade school and technical school in addition many large corporation operate their own formal train program a recent study indicate that per cent of the nation s large corporation conduct educational program involve some class meet and examination most skilled industrial worker nevertheless still acquire their skill outside of formal train institution the national manpower council of columbia university have estimate that three out of five skilled worker and one out of five technician have not be formally train there be little doubt that the student benefit from vocational education employer prefer to hire youth with such train rather than those without and most graduate of vocational train go to work in job relate to their train vocational educator do not claim that school train alone make skilled worker but it provide the essential groundwork for develop skill in most state trade and industrial train be provide in a minority of the high school usually locate in the large city in arkansas few than per cent of the high school offer trade and industrial course in illinois about per cent of the school have program and in pennsylvania per cent an important recent trend be the development of area vocational school for a number of year kentucky louisiana and several other state have be build state sponsor vocational education school that serve nearby school district in several county these school be intend to provide the facility and specialize curriculum that would not be possible for very small school district transportation may be provide from nearby school district course be provide mainly for post high school day program but sometimes arrangement also be make for high school student to attend and evening extension course also may be conduct the title program of the national defense education act of be a great spur to this trend toward area school by there be such school in all but state they be operate in of the major area of chronic labor surplus and in of the minor area an extension of this program into the other distress area should be undertake relation to new industry some of this trend toward area vocational school have be relate to the problem of persistent labor surplus area and their desire to attract new industry the major train need of a new industrial plant be a short period of pre employment train for a large number of semi skilled machine operator a few key skilled worker experience in the company s type of work usually must be bring in with the plant manager or hire away from a similar plant elsewhere a prospective industry also may be interest in the long run advantage of train program in the area to supply future skilled worker and provide supplementary extension course for it employee the existence of a public school vocational train program in trade and industry provide a base from which such need can be fill additional course can readily be add and special cooperative program work out with any new industry if the basic facility staff and program be in be thus besides the train provide to youth in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefit to industry which make it an asset to industrial development effort few state make effective use of their exist vocational education program or fund for the purpose of attract new industry the opportunity exist for state to reserve some of their vocational education fund to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment train program that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant local focus of program the major weakness of vocational train program in labor surplus area be their focus on serve solely local job demand this weakness be not unique to labor surplus area for it be inherent in the system of local school district in this country plan of vocational education program and course be orient to local employer need for train worker all the manual for set up vocational course stress the importance of first make a local survey of skill need of estimate the growth of local job and of consult with local employer on the type of course and their content furthermore there be a cautious conservatism on the part of those make local skill survey local job can be see and count while opportunity elsewhere be regard a more hypothetical while the u s department of labor have a program of project industry and occupational employment trend and publish current outlook statement there be little tangible evidence that these projection have be use extensively in local curriculum plan the u s office of education continue to stress local survey rather than national survey this procedure be extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus area with a long history of decline employment elaborate study have be make in labor surplus area in order to identify sufficient number of local job vacancy and future replacement need for certain skill to justify train program for those skill no effort be make in the same study to present information on regional or national demand trend in these skill or to consider whether regional or national demand for other skill might provide much well opportunity for the youth to be train moreover the current information on what type of train be need and possible be too limit and fragmentary there simply be not enough material available on the type of job skill that be in demand and the type of train program that be require or most suitable much of the available information come not from the federal government but from an exchange of experience among state proposal state and local agency in the vocational education field must be encourage to adopt a wide outlook on future job opportunity there be a need for an expand federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education department and local school board in exist program a relate question be whether unemployed worker can be motivate to take the train provide there be little evidence that exist public or private train program have any great difficulty get student to enroll in their program even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence payment and be not guarantee a job however there always be some limit to the number who will spend the time and effort to acquire train again one major difficulty be the local focus a train program in a depress area may have few enrollee unless there be some apparent prospect for well employment opportunity afterwards and the prospect may be poor if the train be aim solely at job in the local community if there be adequate information on job opportunity for skilled job elsewhere many more worker can be expect to respond another problem be who will pay for the train local school district be hard press financially and unenthusiastic about vocational train program usually be expand only when outside fund be available or local business leader demand it even industrial development leader find it hard to win local support for train unless a new industry be in sight and request it state government have be take the lead in establish area vocational school but their focus be still on area job opportunity only the federal government be likely to be able to take a long run and nation wide view and to pay for train to meet national skilled manpower need if only state fund be use to pay for the vocational education it could be argue that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational train which would benefit employer in other state however if federal fund be use it would be entirely appropriate to train worker for job which could be obtain elsewhere a well a for job in the area of chronic unemployment such train would increase the tendency of worker to leave the area and find job in other locality a far possibility be suggest by the example of the g i bill and also by some recent trend in attitude toward improve college education that be to provide financial assistance to individual for vocational train when local facility be inadequate this probably would require some support for subsistence a well a for tuition but the total would be no great than for the proposal of unemployment compensation or a youth conservation corp a maximum of per year per student would enable many to take train away from home a program of financial assistance would permit place emphasis on the national interest in train highly skilled labor instead of be limit to the poor train facility in remote area the student would be able to move to large institution of concentrate specialize train such specialize train institution could be locate near the most rapidly grow industry where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunity be locate this would heighten possibility for part time cooperative on the job and extension train personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be place on the interest of the individual his aptitude and preference could be give more weight in select the proper train
cj39,cj39,informative,learned,2339,but briefly the top configuration must be examine for it inference then the fact that the lower channel line be pierce have far forecast significance and then the application of the count rule to the width horizontally of the configuration give u an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline the very idea of there be count rule imply that there be some sort of proportion to be expect between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway run up or run down movement this expectation be what really sell point and figure but there be no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strict sense experience will show that only the vague generality apply and in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between the duration and intensity of event after all too much do not happen too suddenly nor do very little take long the advantage and disadvantage of these two type of chart bar chart and point and figure chart remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation among their respective professional advocate with both method enjoy in common one irrevocable merit they be both trend follow method even if we strip their respective claim to the bare minimum the odds still favor them both for the trend in effect be always more likely to continue than to reverse of course many more thing be chart besides price the forego have be method of chart price but now let u look at some of the other index that be customarily chart and which be look to for their forecast ability the quest for method the search for forecast formula be ceaseless correlation have be work up between the loading of freight car and the course of stock price the theory behind this be of course fundamentalist in character a the number of report freight car loading increase this be take to indicate increase industrial activity and consequently increase stock earnings imply fat dividend and imply therefore increase stock market price we now know that thing rarely ever work out in such cut and dry fashion and that car loading while perhaps interest enough be nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock price turn but the quest for such an index go on ceaselessly with all manner of investor and speculator participate range from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe string operator all seek doggedly studiously daily and often nightly for the enchant index that will foretell the eternal secret which way will the market move up or down it recall to mind the quest of olden time for the fountain of youth a quest heavily invest in during the day of wooden ship just a heavily invest be the endeavor of multitude of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchant index the quest offer career much of this go on in office high up in wall street s lofty wind sweep tower there sit men who make move average of weekly volume monthly average of price earnings ratio ratio of the number of advance to the number of decline ratio of an individual stock s performance to overall market performance ratio of rise price volume to fall price volume odd lot index and what not they be concern with all thing trade in security bond cocao coffee soybean cotton tin oat etc and along chicago s west jackson boulevard la salle street and around the merchandise mart plaza there sit men who chart crop report who divide the number of report lady bug by the number of report green bug and the number of hog by the amount of corn they plot the open interest curve rainfall curve and they even divide democratic congressman by republican congressman all these thing and countless more enter into their calculation and yet the enchant index remain non forthcoming not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word the market be far too subtle and the last word in these endeavor will doubtless never be write for the enchant index be about a nebulous a the fountain of youth but whereas civilize men no long pursue the fountain they never abandon their pursuit of the enchant index we mention odd lot index a few paragraph ago in the stock market the normal trade package be a hundred share just a bushel be the standard grain contract package a stock transaction for less than a hundred share be execute via a special odd lot broker on the floor of the exchange this result in a separate record be make distinguish these trade from the overall volume of trade accord to the theory underlie odd lot index the trader who trade odd lot be most likely a small trader one who can t afford to trade round lot or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd lot index enthusiast they represent a sampling of the least sophisticate echelon of trader fall most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of trader can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd lot trader do marketwise be take to exemplify the wrong thing to do figure report the volume of odd lot purchase and odd lot sale be release by the stock exchange and carry in the newspaper odd lot index observer then make graph of the data accord to their particular statistical recipe they might for example plot it exactly a be or they might make ten day move average of it or long move average or they might simply plot the ratio of odd lot purchase to odd lot sale the particular recipe be a matter of individual taste the data be now interpret in conjunction with a price chart usually of a popular stock average towards the end of an intermediate or major rise while the top be form on the price chart it be frequently observe that the odd lot buy increase sharply this warn the chartist that the formation in progress be quite likely to be a top similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while the bottom be be form on the price chart it be characteristic that an increase be notice in odd lot sell again alerting the chartist that a bottom be become a great likelihood thus in the aggregate the odd lot trader be one who buy at the top and sell at the bottom notwithstanding occasional individual exception while it have long be know in general that the public be always wrong the use of odd lot index now put the adage on a statistical basis one might well wonder why the public be always wrong and the question raise be about a awkward a the one concern with the chicken and the egg which come first be it really that the public buy at the top and not that the market top out when the public buy and the converse at bottom do the public usually sell at bottom or do the market usually bottom out when the public sell we have be use the word public in quotation mark that be in it vernacular connotation with reference to the odd lot index theory obviously someone have to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa and while all concern be member of the literal public somewhat less than all concern although still a majority form the quotation mark public and the public minus the public leave the so call sophisticate element the element on the other end of the public s transaction this element be often call strong hand strong hand differ from weak hand in that their operation be the primary mover they initiate campaign so to speak even if this initiation be diffuse among them and their concert action only psychologically organize strong hand act weak hand react strong hand move first weak hand ask what be go on when strong hand buy they be able to buy more and they do it even in the face of bearish news report they be able to sit more patiently with what they have buy needle to say strong hand be not eager to be join by weak hand for this increase the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hand unload on the way up at high price during the run up phase of the campaign certain badly disillusion market critic be often apt to feel that there be something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive force but after all can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these thing be true try to imagine a market in which only a minority of trader would lose and the majority would make consistent profit how much and how many profit could a majority take out of the loss of a few moreover the taunt concern the sophisticate echelon and it allege erudition be put to test during every campaign and accrue only upon result not before it quite often happen that campaign go askew result in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hand into play out hand just a a member of a former campaign s public may emerge flatteringly right the next time membership in the echelon fluctuate too the study of odd lot index be somehow akin to the spectacle of a man try to outfox his own shadow what with all observer try to get on the side of the few at the same time the usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis a well decline in direct proportion to the dissemination of it use it have to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word few diametric opposition must persist a to the future course of price if there be to persist a market at all and the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement would not support market a we know them at all and be in fact unimaginable there need be no squeamishness about admit this anyone still doubt that this be the only way market can be be invite to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently win what the minority lose mr john magee whose work have be discuss in this chapter be quote in a new yorker magazine profile a say of course you have to remember it s a good thing for u chartist that there aren t more of u if you get too many people invest by this method their operation would begin to affect stock price and thus throw the chart off the method would become self defeat mr alexander h wheelan s study help in point and figure technique tell the reader we assure you that the total number of people use this method of market analysis be a very small portion of the sum total of those operate in the security and commodity market what with trader trade for so many different objective and what with there be so many unique and individualize market theory and trade technique in use and more come into use all the time it be hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough fan to invalidate itself nevertheless all theory and technique lead but to one of two possible mode of expression if they lead to a market committment at all in the final analysis then the user become either a bull or a bear in a give instance notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate thus while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it be commonplace for bullish and bearish position to become temporarily over subscribe though the method of decide may be profound and diverse the possible conclusion remain but two chapter more method the hoax the purpose set forth at the begin of this book be first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various type and capability of the forecast method already in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonish empirical correlation that be to follow and to appraise the forecast that it interpretation suggest for the future of farm price over the year immediately ahead
cj40,cj40,informative,learned,2171,in assess the outlook for interest rat in the question a always be the prospect for general business activity by and large what happen to business a a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply condition in the capital market and will thus determine interest rat moreover the trend of general business activity in will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary and other federal policy which affect interest rat nineteen sixty have be a baffle year for analyst of general business activity during much of the year the general level of business activity have move along on a record high plateau but there have be persistent sign of slack in the economy the tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat be become more evident although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year have thus far be quite modest it be hard to escape the conclusion that the soften process will continue into the first quarter of and possibly somewhat long it be difficult to see any powerful source of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust the rate of plant and equipment spend by business and industry now seem to be top out and face some decline in early business cycle when this occur the country usually experience a sharp upturn in residential construction a mortgage finance become easy to obtain at this time however there be sign that increase availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction these sign be the inventory of unsold house in some area of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rat for apartment in september on the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity should receive some stimulus from rise federal spend and the reduction in business inventory have probably run a good part of it course the increase in retail sale in october to a month high be encourage in this connection a well a the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference board which show a decide pickup in consumer spend plan the pattern of general business activity which probably lie ahead of u be a far moderate soften through the spring of before a new rise in economic activity get under way the recovery will probably be spark by a rise rate of housing start next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit a well a by an expansion of government spend well sustain consumer spend and some rebuilding of business inventory slight downward pressure what do the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long term rat in it suggest that during the next several month through the spring of the demand for long term capital fund may be moderately lower and that interest rat may tend to move a little lower especially the rat on federal state and local bond a well a those on publicly offer corporate bond however a witness by the large corporate bond calendar at present a well a the record amount of municipal bond issue approve by voter the over all demand for capital fund seem likely to remain high so that any downward pressure on rat from reduce demand should not be great it seem likely moreover that with an increase in the rate of save in mortgage lend institution interest rat on residential mortgage may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although the increase ease in residential mortgage lend may occur primarily in other term than interest rate e g easy downpayment and amortization term if the trend of general business activity follow the pattern suggest here we be likely to see additional step by the federal reserve authority to ease the availability of credit certainly a far reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility a well a an easy reserve position for the bank system however the monetary authority will continue to be require to pay attention to the consequence of their action with respect to our international balance of payment position and the outflow of gold a well a with regard to avoid the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measure in the next expansion phase of the business cycle open market policy one of the most intrigue question be whether the recent departure of the federal reserve authority from confine their open market operation to treasury bill will spread into long term government security in the next few month to the extent that the new administration have it wish the federal reserve would conduct it open market operation throughout the entire maturity range of government security and aggressively seek to force down long term interest rat the principle of bill only or bill preferably seem so strongly accept by the federal reserve that it be difficult to envision condition which would persuade the authority to depart radically from it by extend their open market purchase regularly into long term government security however to the extent that the monetary authority in their effort to ease credit in the next several month conduct their open market operation in long term government bond they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long term interest rat to ease a a result of market force by the end of the spring of assume that a general business recovery get under way interest rat should begin to edge upward again depend upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authority move to restrain credit availability my guess would be that interest rat will decline moderately into the spring of and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the grind lose during the downturn it be pertinent to ask the question have the long upswing of interest rat during the past year just about run it course and be we now enter a period in which both capital market force and federal policy will produce a prolong decline of interest rat my answer be in the negative because i believe that total capital demand during the sixty will continue to press against available supply and interest rat will generally tend to be firm at high level five basic force this view be base upon several basic economic force which i believe will be operate in the sixty a follow recent event in the general assembly of the unite nation confirm that the cold war will remain with u and probably intensify for the foreseeable future this make it certain that federal expenditure for military preparedness and foreign economic aid be likely to rise far in the next several year we be just begin the task of try to win or maintain the friendship of the new african nation against the ruthless competition of the communist bloc our effort to overcome the lead of the russian in space be bind to mean accelerate federal spend moreover it be likely that federal policy aim at stimulate a fast rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist country and to demonstrate that our free economic system be well than theirs will lead to rise federal spend in certain area such a education housing medical aid and the like there be serious danger involve in this trend toward rise federal expenditure of which i take a dim view but it seem very likely to occur during the sixty we have the prospect of a significant step up in the rate of household formation which should contribute to a rise volume of consumer expenditure and home build accord to the late projection of the bureau of the census the annual rate of household formation will increase for the next year under the most favorable assumption for increase the bureau of the census project that the annual rate of household formation will rise from about in the last two year of the fifty to an annual rate of about in the first five year of the sixty and to a slightly high annual rate of in the second half of the decade during the seventy the projection show a more pronounce rise to an annual rate of in the second half of that decade accordingly the expand market for consumer good and housing occasion by the high rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospect of the sixty however the impact of a rise rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerate the average annual rate of in the second half of the sixty be still considerably below the annual rate of in the three year period from april to march with the expansion of family formation in the sixty a continue substantial rise in expenditure by state and local government unit seem to be indicate this be an area in which there be still a large backlog of demand state and local expenditure in real term increase persistently from billion in to billion in and it would not be surprise if they show a comparable increase in this decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of billion by here would be a powerful force for raise business activity it seem likely that with the three precede force at play the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditure should continue to move upward from the level of the fifty spur by keen competition in our industrial system and still far increase in the fund devote to industrial research plant and equipment expenditure by business and industry should rise during the decade in a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer good and housing which be dam up during the thirty and world war be finally in the process of run dry there be some clear cut evidence of this for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veteran for housing under the va home loan guaranty program seem to have largely exhaust itself indeed the failure of home build a a whole to respond this year to somewhat great availability of mortgage finance and the increase report of pocket of unsold home and rise vacancy rat in apartment build may also signal in part that the lush day of big backlog demand for housing be reach an end in a way we may be witness the same thing in the sale of automobile today a the public no long be will to purchase any car come on the market but be more insistent on compact car free of the frill which be accept in the fifty the huge backlog of demand which be evident in the first decade and a half after the war be feed by liquid asset accumulate by the public during the war and even more so by the easy and easy credit in the consumer loan and home loan field the consume public have use up a good part of these liquid asset or they have be drain by the rise price level and we have apparently get to the end of the line in make consumer or home mortgage term easy this be not to say that the level of consumer expenditure will not continue to rise in the sixty i be confident that it will but consumer spend in the sixty will not be fortify by the great backlog of want and desire which characterize most of the fifty market should become more competitive a consumer become more selective sixty capital requirement accordingly during the sixty our national economy be likely to grow at a fast a rate a in the fifty and in the process to require enormous amount of capital fund
cj41,cj41,informative,learned,2250,wage price policy of industry be the result of a complex of force no single explanation have be find which apply to all case the purpose of this paper be to analyze one possible force which have not be treat in the literature but which we believe make a significant contribution to explain the wage price behavior of a few very important industry while there may be several such industry to which the model of this paper be applicable the author make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wage and price in the steel industry of the unite state since world war indeed the apparent stiffen of the industry s attitude in the recent steel strike have a direct explanation in term of the model here present the model of this paper consider an industry which be not characterize by vigorous price competition but which be so basic that it wage price policy be hold in check by continuous critical public scrutiny where the industry s product price have be keep below the profit maximize and entry limit price due to fear of public reaction the profit seek producer have an interest in offer little real resistance to wage demand the contribution of this paper be a demonstration of this proposition and an exploration of some of it implication in order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call the effect of public limit price on key wage bargain we deliberately simplify the model by abstract from other force such a union power which may be relevant in an actual situation for expository purpose this be best treat a a model which spell out the condition under which an important industry affect with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wage even in the absence of union pressure for high wage part below describe this abstract model by spell out it assumption part discus the operation of the model and derive some significant conclusion part discus the empirical relevance and policy implication of the conclusion part be a brief summary the mathematical appendix present the rigorous argument but be best read after part in order that the assumption underlie the equation may be explicit the assumption of the model a the industry the industry with which this model be concern be a basic industry produce a substantial share of gross national product price competition be lack for the purpose of set the product price the industry behave a a single entity in wage negotiation the industry bargain a a unit with a single union b the demand for the industry s product we be concern with aggregate demand for the industry s product the manner in which this be share among firm be take a give in any give time period the aggregate demand for the industry s product be determine by two thing the price charge by the industry and the level of aj for the purpose of this discussion the problem of relative price be encompass in these two variable since gnp include other price we abstract here from technological progress and assume that price of all other product change proportionately the form of the industry demand function be one which make quantity demand vary inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of aj c industry product price policy the industry of this model be so important that it wage and price policy be affect with a public interest because of it importance and because the lack of price competition be well recognize the industry be under considerable public pressure not to raise it price any more than could be justify by cost increase the threat of effective anti trust action provoke by gouge the public through price increase not justify by cost increase and fear of endanger relation with customer congress the general public and the press all operate to keep price increase in some relation to cost increase for the industry of this model the effect of such public pressure in the past have be to hold the price well below the short run profit maximize price give the wage rate and the level of gnp and even below the entry limit price but not below average cost for such an industry it be only safe to raise it price if such an increase be manifestly justify by rise cost due to rise wage etc thus if public pressure set the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge this pressure be itself a function of the wage rate in this model we abstract from all non wage source of cost change so that the public limit price only rise a the wage rate rise in such circumstance it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate since marginal cost rise when the wage rate rise the profit maximize price also rise when the public limit price be elevate and be likely to remain well above the latter the entry limit price will also be raise for potential domestic competition but unless general inflation permit profit margin to increase proportionately throughout the economy we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price the foreign entry limit price would be approach more rapidly since domestic wage rat do not enter foreign cost directly where this approach become critical the industry can be expect to put much emphasis on this a evidence of it sincerity in resist the wage pressure of a powerful union request tariff relief after it have reluctantly accede to the union pressure whether or not it be in the industry s interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depend upon the extent to which the public limit price rise in response to a basic wage increase and the relation of this response to the increase in cost accompany the wage increase the extent to which the public limit price be raise by a give increase in the basic wage rate be itself a function of three thing the passage of time the level of gnp and the size of the wage increase we be abstract from the fact of strike here but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price be raise by a give increase in the basic wage rate be also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure on the union but in order to educate the government and the customer of the industry a a strike continue these party increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement they become increasingly will to accept the price increase that the industry claim the wage bargain would entail public indignation and resistance to wage price increase be obviously much less when the increase be on the order of per annum than when the increase be on the order of per month the simple passage of an additional eleven month time make the second boost more acceptable thus the public limit price be raise far by a give wage increase the long it have be since the previous price increase notice however that the passage of time do not permit the raise of price per se without an accompany wage increase similarly high level of gnp do not in themselves provide ground for raise price but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise price high for a give wage increase this be not extend to anticipate level of gnp however only the current level of gnp affect the public pressure against wage price increase finally since the public require some restraint on the part of the company large wage increase call for less than proportionately large price increase e g if a wage increase of allow a price increase of a wage increase of allow a price increase of something less than d industry cost we assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation be constant with respect to quantity produce the average cost curve be horizontal and therefore be identical with the marginal cost curve and be the same for every firm and therefore for the industry the level of this average cost be determine by factor price technology and so forth a we have note however we be abstract from change in all determinant of this level except for change in the wage rate the level of average cost equal to marginal cost be thus strictly a function of the wage rate e union policy and collective bargain issue the single union which face the industry do not restrict it membership and there be an adequate supply of labor available to the firm of the industry at the go wage rate the union do not regard unemployment of it own member a a matter of concern when set it own wage policy it concern with employment make itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment the union vigorously demand wage increase from productivity increase and wage increase to offset cost of live increase but we abstract from these force here for our present purpose we assume that the sole subject of bargain be the basic wage rate not include productivity improvement factor or cost of live adjustment and it be this basic wage rate which determine the level of cost productivity be something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a give time period be not even well know to the industry much less to the union or to the public disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbate the problem of agree how an increase in profit margin relate to a productivity increase should be share the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wage do not contradict the assumption that the union be will to settle for cost of live and productivity share increase a distinct from a cost raise increase in the basic wage rate we assume far that the union recognize the possibility that price level increase may offset wage rate increase and it do not entirely disregard the effect of price increase arise from it own wage increase upon the real wage rate for internal political reason the union ask for and accept increase in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards be essentially up to the discretion of the company of the industry change in the basic wage rate be cost raise and they constitute an argument for raise price however it be not know to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase be cause by a give change in the basic wage rate although the company be presume to have reliable estimate of this magnitude in this model then the industry be presume to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since such a change be the only effective mean to raise price they may in circumstance to be spell out in part below find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise thus for non negative change in the basic wage rate the industry become the active wage setter since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence the presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on the ground that it be clearly not in the interest of the industry to raise wage gratuitously from this presumption it be an easy step to the conclusion that any observe increase in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assume in our model it be this conclusion that we challenge we do so by disprove the presumption on which it be base the operation of the model it be convenient to assume that the union industry contract be of one year s duration
cj42,cj42,informative,learned,2304,in the century from to the law of nation become international law several factor contribute to this change the congress of vienna be a convenient start point because it both epitomize and symbolize what be to follow here in the great nation assemble to legislate not merely for europe but for the world thus the congress mark a formal recognition of the political system that be central to world politics for a century international law have to fit the condition of europe and nothing that could not fit this system or the interest of the great european nation collectively could possibly emerge a law in any meaningful sense essentially this impose two condition first international law have to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of state be competitive suspicious and opportunistic in their political alignment with one another second it have to be compatible with the value system that they share in both respect international law be europeanize it be not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two condition on the one hand the major european nation have to maintain vi a vi each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality thus insure for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system require and to avoid anything approach a repetition of the disastrous napoleonic experience but there be no press need to maintain these same standard with regard to most of the rest of the world thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nation and the small european state do not really comfortably fit less develop and less powerful society elsewhere political interference in africa and asia and even in latin america though limit in latin america by the special interest of the unite state a express in the monroe doctrine itself from the outset relate to european politics and long dependent upon the balance of power system in europe be necessary in order to preserve both common economic value and the european balance itself a nation such a switzerland could be neutralize by agreement and could be rely upon to protect it neutrality more doubtful but possible with an assist from the north be the neutralization of the latin american country out of the question be the neutralization of asia and africa this europeanization of the law be make explicit by a number of th century scholar more emphasis be put upon the fact that international law be the law of civilize nation kent and story the great early american scholar repeatedly make use of this phrase or of christian nation which be a substantial equivalent wheaton state that the public law be essentially limit to the civilize and christian people of europe or to those of european origin of course it have always be of european origin in fact but it have maintain a universal outlook under the natural law theory now with virtually every writer not only be the european origin of public law acknowledge a a historical phenomenon but the rule thus establish by the advance civilization of europe be to be impose on others the european custom on which international law be base be to become by force and fiat the custom that others be to accept a law if they be to join this community a sovereign state hall for example be quite explicit on this point when he say state outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of law govern country they must do something with the acquiescence of the latter or some of them which amount to an acceptance of the law in it entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction during the nineteenth century these view be protest by virtually all the latin american writer though ineffectively just a the new nation of africa and asia protest them with more effect today a number of other nineteenth century development contribute to the transmutation of the law of nation into international law that be from aspect of a universal system of justice into particular rule govern the relation of sovereign state the difference be important for although the old law of nation do cover relationship among sovereign this be by no mean it exclusive domain the law of nature govern sovereign in their relationship to their own citizen to foreigner and to each other in a conceptually unify system the theory of international law which in the nineteenth century become common to virtually all writer in europe and america break this unity and this universality it lose sight of the individual almost entirely and confine itself to rule limit the exercise of state power for reason essentially unconnected with justice or morality save a these value might affect international relation no long do the sovereign look to the law of nation to determine what he ought to do his search be merely for rule that might limit his freedom of action to appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspect of nineteenth century philosophy first and most obvious be the grow nationalism and the tendency to regard the state and the individual s identification with the state a transcend other tie of social solidarity national identification be not new but it be accelerate in intensity and scope throughout europe a new unification occur it reach it ultimate philosophical statement in notion of state will put forward by the german especially by hegel although political philosopher will recognize it origin in the reject doctrine of hobbes national identification be reflect jurisprudentially in law theory which incorporate this hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international simply a it formal reflection in the international community this reduce law to jellinek s auto limitation a state the high form of human organization in fact and theory could be subject to law only by a manifestation of self will or consent accord to the new theory the nineteenth century corporate sovereign be sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessor he no long seek to find the law he make it he could be subject to law only because he agree to be there be no law domestic or international except that will by acknowledge by or consent to by state hide behind hegelian abstraction be more practical reason for a change jurisprudence relate to but distinguishable from nationalism be the growth of democracy in one form or another increase participation in politics and the demand of various group for status and recognition have dramatic effect upon law institution the effort of various interest group to control or influence governmental decision particularly when take in conjunction with the impact of industralization lead to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the mean whereby policy could be formulate and enforce a law through bureaucratic institution law become a conscious process something more than simply do justice and look to local custom and a common morality for applicable norm particularly be this true when the norm previously apply be no long satisfactory to many when custom be rapidly change a the force of the new productivity be harness the old way of do thing which depend on a relatively stable community with stable idea deal with familiar situation be no long adequate to the task first be the period of codification of exist law the code napoleon in france and the peculiar codification that in fact result from austin s restatement and order of the common law in england codification be follow in all country by a grow amount of legislation some change and adjust the old law much deal with entirely new situation the legislative mill have be grind ever since and when it cumbersome process be no long adequate to the task a limit legislative authority be delegate in one form or another to the executive whereas the eighteenth century have be a time in which man seek justice the nineteenth and twentieth have be century in which men be satisfy with law indeed with develop positivism the separation of law from justice or from morality generally become quite specific in municipal system we tend to view what be call positivism a fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increase the power of parliament the elect representative at the expense of the more conservative judiciary when the power of the latter be make both limit and explicit when norm be clarify and make more precise and the creation of new norm be place exclusively in parliamentary hand two purpose be serve government be make subservient to an institutionalize popular will and law become a rational system for implement that will for serve conscious goal for embody the public policy it be true that initially the task be to remove restriction that it be think inhibit the free flow of money good and labor but even laissez faire be a conscious policy law be see a an emanation of the sovereign will however the sovereign be not hobbes absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of austin it be too an optimistic philosophy and though it separate law from morality it be by no mean an immoral or amoral one man through democratic institution of government and economic freedom be master of his destiny the theory do not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian mystique it be merely a rationalization and order of new institution of popular government it be not oppose to either justice or morality it merely wish to minimize subjective view of official who wield public authority particularly be this true a laissez faire capitalism become the dominant credo of western society to free the factor of production be a major objective of the rise bourgeoisie and this objective require that governmental authority administrative official and judge be limit a precisely and explicitly a possible that old custom which inhibit trade be abrogate that business be free from governmental supervision and notion of morality which might clog the automatic adjustment of the free market that obligation of status that be inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be do away with contract conceive a the free bargain of formal equal replace the imply obligation of a more static and status conscious society indeed contract be the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone of the free society government itself be base upon contract business organization the corporation be analyze in contractual term trade be base on freedom of contract and money be lend and borrow on contractual term even marriage and the family be see a a contractual arrangement it be not surprise that the international obligation of state be also view in term of contract in fact some anzilotti be the principle example go so far a to say that all international law could be trace to the single legal norm pacta sunt servanda the displacement at least to a considerable extent of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth century by positivism reshape both international law theory and doctrine in the first place the new doctrine bring a formal separation of international from municipal law reject the early view that both be part of a universal legal system one result be to nationalize much that have be regard a the law of nation admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problem which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country be all sever from the old law of nation and make dependent on the several national law private international law which american call the conflict of law be thus segregate from international law proper or a it be often call public international law state be free to enact within broad though perhaps determinate limit their own rule a to the application of foreign law by their court to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard to many claim arise on the high sea the change be not quite so dramatic a it sound because in fact common norm continue to be invoke by municipal court and be only gradually change by legislation and then largely in marginal situation
cj43,cj43,informative,learned,2250,mr justice black be one of the minority that rest on the article power in this view support by only three member of the court a power deny by the specific provision of article be grant by the generality of article if this seem arbitrary it effect be to treat citizen of the district of columbia equally with citizen of the state at the expense of expand a troublesome jurisdiction federal question jurisdiction for almost a hundred year we rely upon state court subject to review by the supreme court for the protection of most right arise under national law then in apparently in response to the nationalize influence of the civil war congress first give the lower federal court general authority concurrently with state tribunal to decide case involve federal right question one purpose of the change be to attain sympathetic enforcement of right insure by the civil war amendment against state interference serious difficulty arise with the advent of substantive due process an amendment presumably design to deal with the problem of newly free slave become a laissez faire limitation upon state economic policy a flood of federal lower court injunction seriously impede the process of local government congress react with a series of measure modify in various way what it have grant in in it require the convene of a special three judge court for the issuance of certain injunction and allow direct appeal to the supreme court such legislation be clarify and extend from time to time thereafter in an abortive provision be make for the stay of federal injunction proceed upon institution of state court test case the essential ineffectiveness of these measure result in in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate order three year late similar restraint be impose upon injunction against collection of state tax this save for state adjudication in the first instance the two major area where federal injunction have be most obnoxious but other area remain vulnerable meanwhile the supreme court like congress show misgiving concern this aspect of government by injunction draw upon the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr justice holmes introduce a series of self impose judicial restraint that culminate in mr justice frankfurter s famous doctrine of abstention whereas the early case turn rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedy the new emphasis be upon the nature of the state policy at issue the classic case be railroad commission v pullman the commission have issue an administrative order which be challenge a discriminatory against negro it enforcement be enjoin by a federal trial court on review the supreme court via mr justice frankfurter find southern racial problem a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal court ought not to enter unless no alternative to adjudication be open an alternative be find in the vagueness of state law a to whether the offend order have in fact be authorize reluctant a usual to interpret state legislation such interpretation can only be a forecast rather than a determination mr justice frankfurter lead a unanimous court to vacate the injunction but it be crucial that here unlike burford the trial court be order to retain the case until the state court have have a reasonable opportunity to settle the state law question the resource of equity be equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision a well a the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication temporary abstention i e postponement be one thing refusal to adjudicate be another to the extent that the jurisdictional principle of stand unmodified by subsequent legislation federal equitable relief against state action must be available or so it seem to mr justice frankfurter in alabama public service commission v southern ry co the commission have refuse to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic train facility the railroad claim deprivation of property without due process of law seek injunctive relief the court hold that federal jurisdiction should not be exercise lest the domestic policy of the state be obstruct this in the name of equitable discretion justice frankfurter and jackson concur in the court s result for they find no merit in the railroad s claim but they object vigorously to the proposition that federal court may refuse to exercise jurisdiction confer in a valid act of congress by one fell swoop the court now find that congress indulge in needle legislation in the act of and by these measure congress so the court in effect now decide give not only needle but inadequate relief since it now appear that the federal court have inherent power to sterilize the act of against all proceed challenge local regulation a most reveal recent case be textile worker union v lincoln mill the taft hartley act give the federal court jurisdiction over suit for violation of contract between an employer and a labor organization represent employee in an industry affect commerce on it face this merely provide a federal forum it do not establish any law right for the federal judge to enforce how can judge exercise jurisdiction to enforce national right when congress have create none the court hold that congress have intend the federal judiciary to fashion an appropriate law of labor management contract in short congressional power to grant federal question authority to federal court be now apparently so broad that congress need not create or specify the right to be enforce the lincoln mill decision authorize a whole new body of federal common law which a mr justice frankfurter point out in dissent lead to one of the follow incongruity conflict in federal and state court interpretation of collective bargain agreement displacement of state law by federal law in state court in all action regard collective bargain agreement or exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matter the justice s elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggest that congress purpose be merely to make union suable with a few exception the lawmaker seem unaware of the technical problem of federal jurisdiction involve to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judge to avoid these constitutional difficulty mr justice frankfurter be prepare to read the taft hartley provision a concern with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction this would satisfy what presumably be congress major purpose the suability of union it would also leave intact the state traditional authority in the realm of contract law a we have see the erie and york decision require federal court in diversity case to follow state decisional rule here again mr justice frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation if congress want to displace the state from area which they have customarily occupy let it do so knowingly and explicitly and let it do it own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judge do lincoln mill suggest that if congress grant jurisdiction over interstate divorce case the federal court would be authorize to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriage there be a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity case congress have not clearly define the bound between state and federal court competence it have the power to do so but for the most part have leave the matter for solution by judge on a case by case basis a careful student have suggest that in any new revision of the judicial code the legislator would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal court should be limit to those matter in which their expertise in federal law might be use leave to the state judiciary the primary obligation of pronounce state law obviously the goal here propose be the guide principle in mr justice frankfurter s opinion to the extent that congress leave the problem to judicial discretion the same rule of specialization and division of labor guide him in the fela certiorari case in the administrative law area and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review mr justice black no doubt concur in principle but be more apt to make exception to achieve a generous and just result he will not be fool by technicality federal review of state decision with few exception congress have not give federal court exclusive authority to enforce right arise under federal law to put it differently state and federal court have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claim of federal right to insure uniformity in the mean of national law however state interpretation be subject to supreme court review it may be note parenthetically that to evade desegregation an ex justice and former southern governor have urge congress to abolish this review authority the result of course would be that federal law inevitably would mean different thing in different state it would also probably mean different thing within the same state depend upon what court state or federal render decision we consider here only a few of many problem involve in this crucial federal state relationship the first be that enforcement of national law in state litigation raise in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance subject to certain constitutional restraint in favor of fair trial each level of government be free to devise it own judicial procedure litigant who choose to assert federal claim in a state court go into that court subject to it rule of procedure a similar canon apply to those who press state claim in federal tribunal e g in diversity case in an fela controversy the state court follow establish state procedure by construe a vague complaint most strongly against the complainant in other word the burden of plead clearly rest upon the pleader by state law the result be that the plaintiff s case be dismiss mr justice black lead a reverse majority strict local rule of plead can not be use to impose unnecessary burden upon right of recovery authorize by federal law here a in the byrd case another element of state procedure be subsume to federal judge make law justice frankfurter and jackson dissent one state may cherish formality more than another one state may be more responsive than another to procedural reform if a litigant choose to enforce a federal right in a state court he can not be hear to object if he be treat exactly a be plaintiff who press like claim arise under state law with regard to the form in which the claim must be state the particularity for instance with which a cause of action must be describe federal law though invoke in a state court delimit the federal claim define what give a right to recovery and what go to prove it but the form in which the claim must be state need not be different from what the state exact in the enforcement of like obligation create by it so long a a requirement do not add to or diminish the right a define by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actuality of litigation another problem in the area of federal state relationship be this what constitute reversible error in a state decision terminiello v chicago involve a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance the conduct in question be a speech the accuse do not object to the trial court s charge to the jury that discourse may constitute a breach of the peace if it stir the public to anger invite dispute bring about a condition of unrest for present purpose it may be assume that this charge so narrowly limit speech a to violate the federal constitution though the accuse raise many other objection he do not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceed that be he do not claim in any of the four court through which his case progress that the jury charge have deny him any federal right
cj44,cj44,informative,learned,2238,how else can one explain for example allow the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium section c but not the right to amortize bond issue expense or allow a deduction for payment of certain obligation of a transferor assume in the reorganization section c but not a deduction for theft loss sustain by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discover after it or require a transferor to carry over it method of depreciation section c but not allow rapid amortization of emergency facility transfer in a reorganization or allow survival of a dividend carryover to a personal hold company section c but not carryover of excess tax credit for foreign tax these item and most of the others list above seem quite comparable to item whose right of survival be provide for in section there do not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in term of the nature of the tax attribute or in term of tax avoidance possibility with respect to item such a these the provision of section c view in historical perspective suggest a rule require survival whether the item be beneficial or detrimental to the survive corporation to this extent some stretch of the literal mean of the committee report seem justify since the literal mean conflict with the clear implication if not the language of the statute it be not contend that section should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor s tax attribute such an interpretation could not be justify by a construction of the statute alone it would certainly violate the intention of congress a express in the committee report and in at least one instance involve refund claim it might be contrary to another provision of the unite state code refund claim section of the unite state code void an assignment of a claim against the government unless make after it have be allow the amount due have be ascertain and a warrant for it payment have be issue if it be not for judicial development of certain exception this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquire corporation for tax pay by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization meet the requirement of section a a clearly recognize exception be a statutory merger or consolidation the lead case seaboard air line railway v unite state hold that the transferee could sue for a refund of tax pay by the transferor and it have be consistently follow the court say the purpose of the section be principally to spare the government the embarrassment and trouble of deal with several party one of them a stranger to the claim and to prevent traffic in claim particularly tenuous claim against the government neither reason say the court apply to the case at hand furthermore congress could not be presume to have intend to obstruct merger approve by the state other exception be assignment for the benefit of creditor corporate dissolution transfer by descent or transfer by subrogation exception be often classify a transfer by operation of law a tax free reorganization not comply with the merger or consolidation statute of the state involve be difficult to fit into an operation of law mold although it be in some way comparable to a voluntary sale of asset for cash to which section quite clearly apply the court and treasury have hold that acquire corporation in several type of non taxable reorganization may sue for refund of tax pay by transferor a recent case in point be mitchell cannery v unite state in which a claim against the government be transfer first from a corporation to a partnership whose partner be former stockholder and then to another corporation form by the partner hold the final corporation entitle to sue on the claim the court cite the seaboard novo trade and roomberg case for the proposition that transfer by operation of law or in conjunction with change of corporate structure be not assignment prohibit by the statute in an early case kingan co v unite state an american corporation be form for the purpose of acquire the stock of a british corporation in exchange for it own stock and then liquidate the british corporation the anti assignment statute be hold not to prevent the american corporation from sue for a refund of tax pay by the british corporation the transaction presumably would have qualify under section a a a contractual reorganization follow by a section liquidation but not under section a a a statutory merger of consolidation the court nevertheless rely on the seaboard case and also mention that the shareholder of the two corporation be the same in substance say the court there be no transfer of equitable title the treasury arrive at substantially the same conclusion but skirt the problem of section of the unite state code revenue rule provide that if the corporation against which a tax be assess have since be liquidate by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund should be file by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which pay the tax follow by the name of the successor corporation proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be file if the succession be a matter of public record certificate of the secretary of state or other public official have custody of the document will suffice if the succession be not of record all document relate to such succession properly certify be require the former proof seem applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition the rule would not however apply to an acquisition of asset for cash a recent rule although rather confuse cite and follow rev rul the rule suggest also that it apply to either a statutory or contractual reorganization hence a successor corporation in a c reorganization appear entitle to sue for a refund of tax pay by the merge corporation despite section in a b reorganization follow by a section liquidation those case which hold that section be inapplicable to transfer in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of tax pay by the transferor in fact a cash purchase of a corporation s stock follow by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the kimbell diamond doctrine be not apply to eliminate the intermediate step these result appear sound a state in seaboard and numerous other case the two primary reason for the enactment of section of the unite state code be to prevent the government from have to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claim on a contingent fee basis the case have allow transfer of claim if beneficial ownership be not change the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meet the condition of section a which be the only type presently under discussion section a apply only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary own to the extent of at least per cent a statutory merger or consolidation an acquisition of substantially all a corporation s asset solely in exchange for vote stock or a change of identity form or place of organization in virtually every case the transferor corporation be liquidate and it former stockholder either own outright or have a continue stock interest in the asset which give rise to the tax in these circumstance the possibility of multiple or conflict claim be exceedingly remote furthermore in a c reorganization the continue interest of stockholder of the corporation which pay the tax must be great than be necessary in a statutory merger to which the statute be clearly inapplicable nor be it at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will be assign on a contingent fee basis in the guise of a tax free reorganization if the transferor have substantial asset other than the claim it seem reasonable to assume no corporation would be will to acquire all of it property in the dim hope of collect a claim for refund of tax if such an unlikely transaction be to take place it would more logically be accomplish by a stock purchase follow by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly own subsidiary follow by liquidation in the rare case where a corporation s only substantial asset or it most important one be a claim for refund perhaps it transfer should not be permit whether the reorganization take the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of asset for stock it appear then that although the matter be not deal with in section c a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specify in section a be entitle to sue for refund of tax pay by a transferor corporation section of the unite state code have be interpret a not apply to claim against the government transfer in tax free reorganization the successor corporation have be hold entitle to sue on such claim other tax attribute of the transferor there be certain tax attribute of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the fact of the particular reorganization involve for example property use in the trade or business of a transferor corporation a define in section presumably would not retain it special status follow a non taxable reorganization if it be not so use in the business of the acquire corporation the parent of a group file consolidate return might be treat a the same corporation follow a reorganization define in section a but a a different corporation for this purpose after a tax free acquisition by another corporation which have not for example elect to file consolidate return with it own subsidiary similar consideration presumably make it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquire and acquire corporation have different method of accounting section c or depreciation section c other section of the internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of a transferor s tax attribute follow a tax free reorganization section require carryover of the transferor corporation s basis for property transfer and section provide for tack on the transferor s hold period for such property to that of the transferee section permit a person acquire grain storage facility to elect to continue amortization over a month period however a similar privilege be not specifically provide in section for a person acquire emergency facility attribute similar to a loss carryover there may be certain item which be quite similar to a net operate loss carryover or operate deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the condition applicable to those item for example suppose another excess profit tax similar to prior law be enact provide for carryover of excess profit credit this carryover right have a number of thing in common with a net operate loss carryover it be an average device intend to ease the tax burden of fluctuate income it be a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expect to have a high excess profit tax under the code this item be permit to survive a tax free reorganization in the stanton brewery case but only over the dissent of judge learn hand who write the majority opinion in the sansome case a lead case require carryover of earnings and profit in a non taxable reorganization since this type of item be not in the statute when section be enact in one can not say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have with respect to this type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee report quote above which caution against use section a a basis for treat other tax attribute not mention therein actually there do not presently appear to be item in the statute comparable to a net operate loss carryover probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operate loss carryover be the unique opportunity it present for tax avoidance
cj45,cj45,informative,learned,2214,a reason for select mail questionnaire method there be two method that could have be use for conduct the study within the resource available interview in depth with a few select company and the more limit interrogation of a large number of company by mean of a mail questionnaire while the method of interview a small number of company be appeal because of the opportunity it might have furnish to probe fully the reason and circumstance of a company s practice and opinion it also involve the risk of pay undue attention to the unique and peculiar problem of just a few individual company a a result it be decide that a mail questionnaire send to a large number of company would be more effective in determine the general practice and opinion of small firm and in highlight some of the fundamental and recur problem of defense procurement that concern both industry and government it be also hop that response to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiry that might be make in subsequent study of a more detail nature it be recognize that a mail questionnaire have inherent limitation there be the danger that the question will mean different thing to different respondent simple yes or no answer do not reveal the different shade of opinion that the various respondent may have a respondent may want to make alternative answer because he do not know the precise circumstance assume in the question there be also the problem of the respondent s frame of reference be the respondent make a recommendation for his own benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific government department or service for the benefit of the defense program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the taxpayer there be also the question of whether the respondent base his answer on factual information and carefully consider judgment or whether his answer be casual guess finally there be the question of how strongly an express opinion be hold whether it be a firm opinion or one that the respondent favor only slightly over the alternative the research team be very mindful of these danger and limitation of a mail questionnaire under the circumstance however the team consider it would provide the most useful information at this point in the preparation of the questionnaire the problem note above be carefully consider and the structure and phraseology use be design to minimize the effect of these limitation b design of the questionnaire the questionnaire be design to elicit three type of information the fact regard certain characteristic of the respondent include their experience with and interest in secure defense business the actual sell and buy practice of the respondent and the attitude and opinion of the respondent concern bid procedure and the method of award defense contract it be hop that the fact concern the characteristic and practice of the respondent would offer clue to the reason why they take the position and make the recommendation which they do the major section of the questionnaire see appendix b be devote to the follow information for classify respondent part a of the questionnaire characteristic of defense sale activity part b of the questionnaire respondent practice in participate in advertise bid for defense business part c of the questionnaire respondent practice in participate in negotiate bid for defense purpose part d of the questionnaire respondent opinion regard advertise bid part e of the questionnaire respondent opinion regard negotiate bid part f of the questionnaire respondent preference regard the method of award defense contract part g of the questionnaire the questionnaire provide a place for the name of the respondent but state that identification of the respondent be optional the questionnaire also state that in any event all reply would be treat confidentially it be interest to note that per cent of those who return the questionnaire identify themselves c preparation and pretest of the questionnaire the research team prepare and then revise the questionnaire over a period of six month in june an early draft of the questionnaire along with a cover letter be mail to fourteen company in the state of washington several day after the company have receive the questionnaire member of the research team contact the president of eleven of these company in person or by phone to discus any ambiguity or difficulty the addressee might have experience in complete the questionnaire this test result in far revision of the questionnaire the research team be concern that response from firm in the state of washington might not be typical of those throughout the country or that the result might be different when no phone or personal follow up be make accordingly another test of the questionaire be make the revise draft be mail in july to firm throughout the unite state fifty of the firm be select on a random basis from name submit by member company of the aerospace industry association aia list and fifty be select in a similar manner from a list of name compile by the research team from the thomas register tr list the method of compile the aia and tr list will be describe late ten day after the questionnaire be mail follow up airmail postcard be send urging those company which have not yet return their questionnaire to do so at once twenty eight return in all be receive the response be carefully check for obvious error in the answer or for question that be apparently not understand by the respondent the cover letter questionnaire and follow up postcard be then revise into final form see appendix a b and c d compilation of mailing list the objective of the study be to determine the opinion and practice of small firm sell to defense program the firm to receive the questionnaire be select with this objective in mind three list of company be make and use in the study the first be a list of fourteen manufacture company locate in the state of washington which be personally know to the research team to be active in defense work the primary consideration in the compilation of this list be convenience in discuss the questionnaire with company officer the second list be derive from a group of approximately name supply to the research team by the aerospace industry association these name be secure from member company by the association from the forty four source list in appendix aj each source select from it approve bidder list about firm which it believe to be small business that participate in the production of weapon and weapon support system where possible the name of an executive be supply along with the company name and address the forty four list supply by the aia member company be merge and duplicate name be eliminate there be far elimination of all company that be not accompany by the name of a responsible company executive the remain name be then check against the thomas register list see below and duplicate name be remove from the aia list by these step the final aia list be reduce from to the third list be select by the research team on a random basis from the thomas register it be compile a a control sample to determine if the opinion and practice of company on the list submit by the member of the aerospace industry association be materially different from those of other small firm sell to defense program such a difference might have result from the fact that the aerospace industry association member whose list be use do not comprise all firm engage in defense program the fact that company on the aia list be already participate in the defense program because of the manner of their selection accordingly a in group they might have different opinion and practice than an out group compose of those company not so participate but interest in defense business the fact that aia list might not have be select on a random basis the control sample be select by take the bottom name of each of the two column of name on each page of the alphabetical list of manufacturer in the thomas register if the bottom name in each column do not have a responsible executive identify the next name above which identify such a responsible executive be substitute fifteen hundred name be select in this fashion e mailing the questionnaire each questionnaire be mail with a cover letter address personally to the president or other executive of each firm the questionnaire be mail in seattle washington and send by regular mail to address in the state of idaho montana oregon and washington airmail be use for the address outside the pacific northwest each letter contain a postage prepay return envelope by regular mail for address in the pacific northwest and by airmail for those outside the pacific northwest approximately ten day after the questionnaire be mail a follow up airmail postcard be send to each of the original name the first test mailing to company be make in june the second test mailing to company be make in july the final mailing of the questionnaire be make late in august to firm consist of from the aia list and from the tr list f return receive over return be receive within two week after the final mailing be make they continue to arrive until the end of december by which time a total of return be receive represent per cent of the questionnaire send out fifty seven return could not be use because they be incomplete or receive too late to be process the remain return that be process come from the category in table g process the return each questionnaire be audit for obvious mistake and for comment and be identify by a serial number by the source list from which the company name be select and by the geographical location of the company a determine by the postmark on the return envelope all response except comment be numerically cod to permit use of data process equipment the cod be key punch into ibm punch card and verify each return require three card and involve key punch digital column in order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three card comprise the set for each firm be identify with the appropriate serial number of the respondent the card be then process use standard ibm punch card equipment include an ibm computer the first step in process be to analyze the return from question and to determine whether the respondent be large business or small business in accordance with the definition contain in aspr section see chapter the result be show in table the return from company classify a large business be set aside and not use because they be not relevant to a study of the opinion and practice of small firm the second step in process be to compare the response from company on the aia list with those from company on the tr list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the response for the purpose of the study the method and result of this comparative analysis be describe in appendix aj it be conclude that it would be appropriate to process the two group of response a a single sample of all small business engage in or wish to sell to defense program in the first place the two group of firm when combine have characteristic and practice that be more representative of company that be the subject of this study than do the firm from the aia list alone
cj46,cj46,informative,learned,2266,the vast central valley of california be one of the most productive agricultural area in the world during the summer of it become the set for a bitter and basic labor management struggle the contestant in this economic struggle be the agricultural worker organize committee awoc of the afl cio and the agricultural employer of the state by virtue of the legal responsibility of the department of employment in the farm placement program we necessarily find ourselves in the middle between these two force it be not a pleasant or easy position but one we have endeavor to maintain we have seek to be strictly neutral a between the party but at the same time we have be require frequently to rule on specific issue or situation a they arise inevitably one side be please and the other displease regardless of how we rule often the displease party interpret our decision a imply favoritism toward the other we have console ourselves with the think that this be a normal human reaction and be one of the consequence of any decision in an adversary proceed it be disconcert nevertheless to read in a labor weekly perluss knuckle down to grower and then to be confront with a grower publication which state perluss recognize obviously phony and trump up strike a bona fide for a number of year there have be sporadic attempt in california to organize farm worker these attempt meet with little sucess for a variety of reason they be inadequately finance without experience leadership and lack the general support of organize labor a a whole this past year the pattern have be different the organize program have the full support of the afl cio which supply staff and money to the awoc a well a moral support leadership be experience and skillful and financial resource be significant regardless of where personal sympathy may lie a between the party failure to recognize these change condition would be to ignore the fact of life a a result of these change condition the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor management relation have be much great than in the past the awoc have be able to employ the traditional weapon of labor the strike and the picket line with considerable success particularly in the area of wage by the very nature of the situation it be the union which have be able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management to date at least the strategy of the awoc have be selective that be to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the state primarily we become involve in these dispute because of our referral obligation under our farm placement program normally because agricultural labor be not cover by unemployment insurance we would not expect any issue to arise regard benefit payment under the trade dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although such a situation be quite within the realm of possibility but the current issue arise out of the wagner peyser act concern referral to an establishment where a labor dispute exist and out of public law and the migrant labor agreement if mexican national be employ at the ranch most of u remember and think of the wagner peyser act in it historical sense a a major milestone in the development of public placement service infrequently do we think of it a a live continue operate control over the system however when labor dispute arise it provision come clearly into play california have accept the provision of that act a have all other state by enact into our code section a provision that the state of california accept the provision of the wagner peyser act and will observe and comply with the requirement of that act with respect to labor dispute the wagner peyser act state only in carry out the provision of this act the secretary be authorize and direct to provide for the give of notice of strike or lock out to applicant before they be refer to employment other provision of the act empower the secretary to adopt regulation necessary to carry out it provision and he have do so the pertinent regulation for our purpose be section a follow referral in labor dispute situation no person shall be refer to a position the fill of which will aid directly or indirectly in fill a job which be vacant because the former occupant be on strike or be be lock out in the course of a labor dispute or the fill of which be an issue in a labor dispute with respect to position not cover by subparagraph or of this paragraph any individual may be refer to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exist provide he be give write notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral in analyze this regulation let u take the last sentence first it permit referral under certain circumstance even when there be a labor dispute provide the individual be give write notice of such a dispute assume for example a situation where a farm have a pack shed and field the pack shed worker go on strike there be no dispute involve fieldwork we conclude that we may refer worker to the fieldwork but not the pack shed work provide we give them write notice of the pack shed dispute so far no troublesome case have arise under this provision it be the first part of the regulation that be currently at issue note that it prohibit referral under either condition or condition employer representative have contend that the secretary have go beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the ground that the wagner peyser act require only write notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exist into court the matter get into the court this way one of the early strike call by the awoc be at the digiorgio pear orchard in yuba county we find that a labor dispute exist and that the worker have leave their job which be then vacant because of the dispute accordingly under clause of the secretary s regulation we suspend referral to the employer incidentally no mexican national be involve the employer seek to continue his harvest challenge our right to cease referral to him and seek relief in the superior court of yuba county the court issue a temporary restrain order direct u to resume referral we of course obey the court order however the attorney general of california at the request of the secretary of labor seek to have the jurisdiction over the issue remove to the federal district court on ground that it be predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary s regulation be be challenge however the federal court hold that since the state have accept the provision of the wagner peyser act into it own code and presumably therefore also the regulation it be now a state matter it accordingly refuse to assume jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court make the restrain order permanent under that order we have continue refer worker to the ranch a similar case arise at the bower ranch in butte county and the superior court of that county issue similar restrain order the grower have strenuously argue that i should have accept the superior court decision a conclusive and issue statewide instruction to our staff to ignore this provision in the secretary s regulation i can not accept that view either a a lawyer or a an administrator legal consideration first let u examine briefly some of the legal consideration involve it be an accept juridical principle in california that a superior court decision do not constitute a bind legal precedent it be conclusive unless appeal only upon the particular party to the particular action which be hear it be not bind upon another superior court which could rule to the contrary only when a decision be render by the district court of appeal or of course the supreme court be a bind precedent establish in that event we can correctly say that we have receive an authoritative interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrow in other superior court but over and beyond the compel need for a bind precedent decision i be convince that the decision of the superior court which in effect nullify the secretary s regulation be not a correct interpretation of the secretary s power under the federal law i believe i be in good company in this view the attorney general of california concur in this interpretation and have file an appeal from these decision to the district court of appeal the attorney general of the unite state in consider the power of the secretary to issue similar regulation under the wagner peyser act relate to the interstate recruitment of farm worker have render an opinion sustain his authority far and a an evidence of legislative intent only the senate of the unite state recently defeat by a substantial majority the holland amendment to the fair labor standard act which would have specifically limit the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matter next let u consider briefly the program and administrative implication of a failure on our part to pursue our appeal there be far too much at stake for all of the party concern to leave the matter hang in midair the ramification of the issue be enormous a decision to refer worker to job vacant because of a strike would have to be apply equally to nonagricultural situation and might in effect place the public employment service in the position of act a strikebreaker the public interest be so dominant in such an issue that i can not be so presumptuous a to attempt to settle it by an administrative order base upon conclusion reach in a summary action in one or two superior court in the state it be an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the unite state before judicial finality be achieve a an administrator i can not place the employment service in california in jeopardy of be out of compliance with the federal law by my failure to pursue the avenue of appeal open to me to have apply statewide the decision of the two case hear in superior court in my opinion would have place u clearly out of compliance with the wagner peyser act and would have immediately open the way for the secretary of labor be he so incline to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for hearing and issue his find the impact of noncompliance under the wagner peyser act be clear the withdrawal of some million a year of administrative fund which finance our employment service program or a a corollary the take over by the federal government of it operation thus far the case which have come before the court have involve only the issue of referral where the job be vacant due to a strike condition in the regulation of the secretary none have yet arise under condition relate to referral to job the fill of which be an issue in a labor dispute here the problem be essentially one of define the word fill should it be define in a narrow sense to include only such element a job specification union membership union jurisdiction and the like or should it have a broad connotation of include wage demand and other factor not necessarily associate with the mechanic of fill the job because of the uncertainty of this definition i solicit the interpretation of the secretary of labor he have advise me that the narrow interpretation be the proper one that be that if wage for example be the only issue in a labor dispute and no worker have leave their job because of the dispute we may continue to make referral
cj47,cj47,informative,learned,2260,martin and stendler present evidence that infant and young child can and do solve many problem at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combine object and count them after they have develop concept they be free from the necessity of manipulate object they do symbolically what they once have to do concretely the ability to think seem to increase consistently with age one experiment show the greatest one year difference occur between the eleventh and twelfth year many study indicate that elementary school child s interest cover the whole field of science that their question indicate a genuine interest in social process and event and that a they mature their interest and capability change and broaden emotional characteristic how a child feel about himself about other people and about the task confront him in school may have a much influence on his success in school a his physical and intellectual characteristic a considerable amount of evidence exist to show that an unhappy and insecure child be not likely to do well in school subject emotional maturity be the result of many factor the principal one be the experience of the first few year of the child s life however the teacher who understand the influence of emotion on behavior may be highly influential in help pupil gain confidence security and satisfaction concern this responsibility of the teacher suggestion for help child gain well control of the emotion be present in chapter the follow generalization about the emotional characteristic of elementary school child may be helpful typically the young child s emotional reaction last for a relatively short time a contrast to those of an adult a the child grow old his emotional reaction lead to mood or emotional state draw out over a period of time and express slowly rather than in short abrupt outburst study of the growth and decline of child s fear indicate that fear due to strange object noise fall and unexpected movement decline during the preschool year but that fear of the dark of be alone and of imaginary creature or robber increase ridicule a child for be afraid or force him to meet the fear situation alone be poor way of deal with the problem more effective solution include explanation the example of another child or condition by associate the fear object place or person with something pleasant child need help in learn to control their emotion the young child learn from parent and teacher that temper tantrum scream kick and hit will not get him what he want the old child learn that intense emotional outburst will not win approval by his peer and therefore make a real effort to control his emotion child differ widely in their emotional response among infant the pattern of emotional response be similar a the influence of learn and environment be felt emotional behavior become individualize social characteristic although no national norm exist for the social development of child the teacher can find a great deal of information concern type of social behavior normally display by child at various age level the follow summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristic of elementary school child the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinate study of immature individual struggle to meet their developmental need and at the same time try to learn the rule of the game in the ever expand number of group in which they hold membership during early childhood child be more interest in the approval of their parent and teacher than they be in the approval of other child after they have be in school a few year their interest in playmate of their own age increase and their interest in adult decrease the child who have once consider it a treat to accompany his parent on picnic and family gather now consider it a bore in late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continue to increase the group set the style in clothe the kind of play engage in and the ideal of right and wrong behavior in early childhood the choice of a companion be likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two old who can do the thing he like to do such factor a sex intelligence and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time in late childhood an interest in team game replace individual play loyalty to the group a feel of superiority over those who be not member and unwillingness to play with member of the opposite sex become dominant trait during early childhood boy tease and bully on the average more than girl those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activity more than do well adjust child during late childhood boy like to tease jostle and talk smart to girl girl who be more mature than boy frown upon the youthful antic of boy of their own age by the time pupil reach the sixth grade their ethical and moral standard be fairly well develop they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problem but they frequently have vague and incorrect notion about the term they use rather glibly in their routine school work between the age of two and four year negativism or resistance to adult authority be noticeable after the fourth year it begin to decline however a we have see in late childhood the child begin to substitute the standard of the peer group for those of parent and teacher the elementary school child grow gradually in his ability to work in group the child in the primary grade can play harmoniously with one companion but his desire to be first in everything get him into trouble when the group get large he want to be with people but he hasn t yet learn to cooperate in the middle grade however he begin to participate more effectively in group activity such a select a leader help to make plan and carry on group activity and set up rule govern the enterprise why the teacher should study the individual pupil much progress have be make in the last two decade in develop technique for understand child yet in almost any classroom today can be find child whose need be not be meet by the school program some be fail to achieve a much a their ability would permit others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom these child have be describe a those who be try to say something to adult who do not understand many school system now employ school psychologist and child guidance specialist these specialist perform valuable service by help teacher learn to identify child who need special attention by suggest way of meet the need of individual child in the regular classroom and by provide clinical service for severely maladjusted child it be the classroom teacher however who have daily contact with pupil and who be in a unique position to put sound psychological principle into practice indeed a study of the individual child be an integral part of the work of the elementary school teacher rather than merely an additional chore teacher and administrator in many elementary school have assume that divide the pupil in any grade into group on the basis of test score solve the problem of meet the need of individual what they should recognize be that child who have be place in one of these group on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attribute that influence success and that they still must be treat a individual although the teacher must be concern with maintain standard he must also be concern about understand difference in ability background and experience factor that inhibit learn and lead to maladjustment study conduct in various section of the unite state indicate that many child in elementary school be maladjusted emotionally and that many of them be fail to make satisfactory progress in school subject one study which involve pupil in grade one to six find that percent of the pupil be seriously maladjusted and that percent be read a year below capacity it be apparent therefore that the teacher need to know what factor have a vital bear on the learn and adjustment of child when a child fail to meet the standard of the school in his rate of learn insecurity unhappiness and other form of maladjustment frequently follow these maladjustment in turn inhibit learn and a vicious cycle be complete it be easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who be not achieve in accordance with his know ability be just plain lazy or that the child who lack interest in school who dislike the teacher or who be overaggressive be a hopeless delinquent the cause of retardation and maladjustment may be find in physical factor such a defective speech or hearing impair vision faulty motor coordination a frail constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunction they may be cause by poor health habit such a faulty eat and sleeping habit they may be relate to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain type of school work the curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others teaching method learn material and promotion policy may inhibit learn and lead to maladjustment for some child unwholesome family relation break home and undesirable community influence may also be contribute factor this be only a minimum list of the factor that inhibit learn and contribute to maladjustment among child moreover these condition do not influence all child in the same manner a vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and read disability for one child may spur another child on to even great achievement in read an impoverish home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation cause another to work hard for successful achievement in school at any rate the teacher who recognize common cause of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the cause of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment source of information about child successful teaching involve get enough information about each pupil to understand why he behave a he do in certain situation and how his achievement in school be be influence by various factor in his environment the classroom teacher can not be expect to be a proficient in the use of the technique of child study a the clinical psychologist he can not be expect to administer all the test and gather all the information need about each child in his classroom he can be expect however to examine and interpret the information already available to refine and extend his own technique for study individual child and to utilize opportunity arise in connection with regular classroom activity for gain a well understand of his pupil this section deal with some of the source of information that can be tap by the classroom teacher chapter provide more detail information about specific technique use in evaluate pupil progress cumulative record most school system today maintain a system of cumulative record of pupil these record when systematically maintain provide much information about the child which the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and report to parent each teacher have in his classroom a metal file equip with a lock which be use to store cumulative record folder during summer vacation period these record be store in the office of the principal only the teacher and other professional personnel be permit to see or use these record each new teacher to whom the pupil go be expect to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date some school system provide write instruction to principal and teacher designate when certain information be to be record on cumulative record form and

include the old dominion state in spite of it stern resistance the record be clear that increase in school desegregation last year come largely a a result of a court order that on the immediate horizon if far large scale relatively speak desegregation come it will result from court order on suit file in several middle south state knowledge that thousand of school district be involve and observation that school desegregation have occur in only a handful in lead to a conclusion that desegregation from court order be slow before turn to my view a to the problem and issue before u at this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary report a it refer to the district of columbia that reference in the report be continuation of the trend toward an all negro school system a remark apparently occasion by the increase of negro school population from per cent to per cent i see no real prospect for an all negro school population west of rock creek park be still monolithically white and be in fact increasingly white a a result of georgetown s conversion by renovation housing program nearby foggy bottom be oust negro the large acreage in the southwest redevelopment area beckon white people what with high price town house and elevator apartment the capitol hill rehabilitation like foggy bottom replace negro with white but also replace some white with other white the sharp break with tradition the past and present of white ring around a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery county suburb to negro resident and presumably the consequent conclusion of some white that they can not escape the negro by flee to the suburb in fact short of flee to warrenton virginia or rockville maryland white people may have to live with negro all of this must be take into account before the image of an all negro d c public school system be conjure up problem to solve from the summary report before u at this conference a number of problem be apparent they vex u and perplex u but generally do not divide u like the issue which follow the problem first how can we step up the desegregation movement it be slow i believe we all want more school where white and negro together can and do attend i believe we all want no child deny admission to a school on account of his color in general member of nairo would certainly want a child admit to a school near his residence or within his residence zone how to achieve this objective be a problem but we be not divide on what we want second a we increase the number of desegregate school district and school themselves how can we achieve this action through school board action it may be county school board or state school board action a well a that of municipal school board correlatively can we reduce the role of the district court so that the action be that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court this be a problem and i believe there be little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation third how can we insure a systematic and continue group relation education in the school not simply a brief program when the school be actually desegregate but a continue program that also promote integration that encourage the child and teacher not to look at each other a white or negro but a human be again the problem be how to get it do and in what form to offer the group relation education not whether it should be do fourth in the segregate school system during the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity in fact in the desegregate school system which may have a good many school with all negro population how can we assure equal opportunity this be a problem but we be not divide over it importance or by it existence fifth in the segregate school system or in the all negro or all white school how can we encourage well group relation or an improve attitude toward people who do not belong to the group can we help child adjust to image of other child when the latter be not actually present now the issue if we have five problem whose solution we seek in relatively unite fashion then there be twice a many issue which i judge sharply divide u intergroup relation practitioner and lay people issue no pupil assignment since on the one hand school desegregation have come in virginia hand in glove with pupil assignment shall we support the plan on the basis of pupil assignment criterion judge albert bryan have assign negro child to formerly white school in arlington and alexandria virginia shall we support pupil assignment on the other hand look at the large picture be it true that pupil assignment have effectively cut off block or reduce school desegregation to a trickle shall we therefore oppose the plan this question be an issue because it likely divide u into two camp those for or against pupil assignment issue no teacher assignment in order to desegregate in large city like baltimore louisville and washington d c should school desegregation be extend to all negro and all white school by assign white and negro teacher respectively on the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision require only that a child not be deny admission to a school on account of his race or should we argue that if we want adjustment of child to child of different race and that that be impossible in an all something or the other school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another race we can argue that where residence make pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregate situation issue no the plaintiff in school desegregation case the early part of my statement deal with the court order that result in desegregation in each instance the plaintiff be a private citizen in thousand of school district indeed in the entire state of mississippi no plaintiff have come forth and i have establish that the action of municipal county or state school board or board of education be small infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of district be the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually deny admission to a school a sound requirement should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he be deny entrance even though in civil right legislation in and the provision for the attorney general to act be eliminate should we nevertheless support such a clause this be an issue for it divide people rather sharply issue no withholding of fund to school that deny child on account of race this be the powell amendment which in divide even a liberal group like the american veteran committee avc should we support a clause in federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny federal fund to a school district that deny admission to a child on account of his race this be soft than early powell amendment which would have deny fund to all segregate school district there be nonetheless considerable argument against the clause soften though it be on the ground that federal aid be so necessary to the public school the federal fund limitation enlist the support of many the opposition of quite a few issue no require public education should a political subdivision state or county or municipality be require to furnish public education for the school year the prince edward county virginia board of supervisor vote not to provide fund for public education and the school board therefore could provide no public education for white or negro child be public education in this american democracy of such importance that no child should be deny public education or be this subject a matter of self determination a matter of state right or county right if people don t want to provide public education should they be force to do so even if we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education we likely can not expect that all the state will enact the legislation should the requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be legislate by the unite state congress or must it become law by amendment of the unite state constitution we actually have two issue in this question goal and method issue no federal responsibility for education of the citizen if the above issue be settle by require public education for all citizen issue no may be moot if on the other hand it be not settle or while it be be debate and resolve do the federal government have a responsibility in situation like that in prince edward county nearly half the child still receive no education must or should the federal government help should the government directly provide education for the child who want public education
cj49,cj49,informative,learned,2189,the next question be whether board member favor their own social class in their role a educational policy maker on the whole it appear that they do not favor their own social class in an explicit way seldom be there an issue in which class line can be clearly draw a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already be a good private college which serve the middle class youth adequately but be too expensive for work class youth in situation of this sort the board generally favor the expansion of free education campbell study the record of school board member in twelve western city over the period of and find little or no relationship between certain social and economic factor and school board competence a judge by a panel of professional educator who study the vote record on educational issue the few case of clear favoritism along social class line be a likely a not to involve representative of the work class on the school board who favor some such practice a high wage for janitor rather than pay increase for teacher and such issue be not issue of educational policy in general it appear that trustee and board member attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy and this be make easy by the fact that the dominant value of the society be middle class value which be generally think to be valid for the entire society there have be very few case of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy if there be more such case it would be easy to answer the question whether the policy maker favor their own social class there be currently a major controversy of public education in which group interest and value be heavily engage this be the issue of segregate school in the south in this case it be primarily a matter of conflict of racial group rather than social class group thus the white middle and lower class be array against the negro middle and lower class this conflict may be resolve in a way which will suit white middle class people well than it suit white lower class people if this happen there may be some class conflict in the south with school board and school teacher take the middle class position the educational profession the member of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position be strong in the university they be mostly upper middle and lower middle class people with a few in the upper class do they make class bias decision in a society dominate by middle class value and work in an institution which transmit and strengthen these social value it be clear that the educational profession must work for the value which be characteristic of the society there be no problem here the problem arise if it do arise when the educator have to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence but which bear some relation to the social structure for instance in give school grade or in make recommendation for the award of a college scholarship do he consciously or unconsciously favor student of one or another social class again in decide on the content and method of his teaching do he favor a curriculum which will make his student strong competitor in the race for high economic status or do he favor a curriculum which strengthen student in other way the answer to question such a these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator s own social class position and also upon his social history a well a upon his personality and what he conceive his mission to be a an educator in a set of case study of teacher with various social class background wattenberg illustrate a variety of approach to student and to teaching which depend upon the teacher s personality a well a on his social class background one upward mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower class pupil because she want them to develop the attitude and skill that will enable them to climb while another upward mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower class pupil because he know their disadvantage and deprivation at home and he hop to encourage them by friendly treatment one social class factor which play a large part in educational policy today be the fact that a great many school and college teacher be upward mobile from urban lower class and lower middle class family their own experience in the social system influence their work and attitude a teacher while this influence be a complex matter depend upon personality factor in the individual a well a upon his social class experience there probably be some general statement about social class background and educational policy that can be make with a fair degree of truth teacher who have be upward mobile probably see education a most valuable for their student if it serve student a it have serve them that be they be likely to favor a kind of education that have vocational advancement value this do not necessarily mean that such teacher will favor vocational education a contrast with liberal education but they be likely to favor an approach to liberal education which have a maximal vocational advancement value a against a kind of pure liberal education that be not design to help people get well job there be no doubt that high education since world war have move away from pure liberal education toward great emphasis on technology and specialization there be several cause for this one be rapid economic development with increase number of of middle class position require engineering or scientific train but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty member with their own use of education a a mean of social advancement compare with the college and university faculty member of the period from to the new postwar faculty member consist of more child of immigrant and more child of urban work class father their experience be quite in contrast with that of child of upper and upper middle class native bear parent who be more likely to regard education a good for it own sake and to discount the vocational emphasis in the curriculum the public interest group educational policy be form by several group who be officially or unofficially appoint to act in the public interest legislator be one such group and state legislator have major responsibility for educational legislation they generally vote so a to serve their own constituency and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might be expect to vote and work for middle or for lower class interest in education however there be relatively few such political constituency and a have be point out there be seldom a clear cut distinction between the educational interest of one social class and those of another another public interest group be the commission of layman or educator which be appoint to study an educational problem and to make recommendation generally these commission work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society a they conceive it nevertheless their conclusion and recommendation can not please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view for instance there have be two presidential commission on high education since world war president truman s commission on high education tend to take a liberal expansionist position while president eisenhower s committee on education beyond the high school be slightly more conservative both commission consist of upper middle and upper class people who attempt to act in the public interest an example of a more definite class bias be note in proceed of the commission on the finance of high education sponsor by the association of american university and support by the rockefeller foundation and the carnegie corporation this commission recommend against the use of federal government fund for the assistance of private university and against a broad program of government support scholarship this might be say to be an upper or an upper middle class bias but the commission publish a one of it staff study a book by byron s hollingshead entitle who should go to college which recommend a federal government scholarship program furthermore the commission set up the council for financial aid to education a a mean of encourage private business to increase it support of private high education thus the commission act with a sense of social responsibility within the area of it own conviction about the problem of government support to private education then there be the trustee and officer of the great educational foundation who inevitably exert an influence on educational decision by their support or refusal to support various educational program experiment and demonstration these people be practically always upper or upper middle class person who attempt to act in what they regard a the interest of the entire society finally there be the parent organization and the layman s organization such a the national association of parent and teacher and the citizen committee on public school these have an upper middle class leadership and a middle class membership with rare exception where work class parent be active in local p t a matter like the other policy make group these be middle class in their educational attitude and they attempt to act in the general public interest a they see it in general it appear that educational decision and educational policy be make by people who intend to act in the interest of the society a a whole they be predominantly middle and upper class people and undoubtedly share the value and attitude of those class they may be unaware of the existence of lower class value and consequently fail to take them into account but there be very little frank and conscious espousal of the interest of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decision in education they think of themselves a trustee for the entire society and try to serve the entire society attempt to influence social structure through education educational policy in the unite state have a an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity in so far a this goal be achieve the society become more fluid artificial barrier to social mobility be reduce and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural good of society on the other hand there be a counterbalance purpose in education which be to pass on the advantage of the parent to their child this lead to effort at exclusiveness through private school and to the maintenance of social stratification in the school both of these purpose exist side by side without much overt conflict under present condition maximize economic and cultural opportunity the broad expansion of free education result both in raise the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promote fluidity within the social structure fifty year ago the general raise of the school leave age to sixteen be an example of this movement during the past decade the program have be carry on through expansion of free high education in state university state college and community college the reaffirmation of american faith in the comprehensive high school a express in the conant study be another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of maximize opportunity through the equalize of educational opportunity the recent federal government s student loan program be another step in the direction of make high education more available to lower status youth it be probably more effective than the expand scholarship program of the past decade because the scholarship program mainly aid the student with the best academic record who be usually middle class and these student tend to use the scholarship fund to go to more expensive college meanwhile the private college have increase their tuition rat so much that they have raise an economic barrier which dwarf their scholarship fund the gain in educational opportunity during the past decade have take place largely in the publicly support institution
cj50,cj50,informative,learned,2319,unfortunately however and for reason to be discuss in the follow chapter no rate relationship can be make completely nondiscriminatory a long a all or some of the rat must be set above marginal cost in order to yield adequate revenue and this fact may explain some of the disagreement among the expert a to the more rational formula for the apportionment of total cost among different unit of service one such disagreement which will receive attention in this next chapter concern the question whether rat for different kind of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must be make directly proportional to marginal cost or whether they should be base instead on difference in marginal cost here the choice be that between the horn of a dilemma two major type of fully distribute cost analysis the double step type despite an ambiguity due to it failure clearly to define relative cost the above exposition of fully distribute cost go about a far a one can go toward express the basic philosophy of the practice for more explicit exposition one must distinguish different type of analysis by all mean the most important distinction be that between those total cost apportionment which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residue on estimate of incremental or marginal cost and those other apportionment which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total cost distribution the first or double step type might also be call the railroad type because of it application to railroad and other transportation agency by the cost section of the interstate commerce commission the cost section distinguish between directly variable cost and constant cost in a manner note in the precede chapter the variable cost alone be assign to the different unit of freight traffic a represent long run out of pocket cost a term with a mean here not distinctly different from that of the economist s long run marginal cost there remain a residue of total cost or total revenue requirement which since it be find to behave a if it be constant over substantial variation in traffic density be strictly unallocable on a cost find basis nevertheless because the cost section have felt impel to make some kind of a distribution of total cost it have apportion this residue which it sometimes call burden among the unit of carload traffic on a basis partly ton partly ton mile which be concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination in recent year this burden which include allowance for revenue deficiency in the passenger business and in less than carload freight traffic have amount to about one third of those total revenue requirement which the carload freight business be suppose to be call upon to meet since this book be concern only incidentally with railroad rat it will not attempt to analyze the method by which the staff of the interstate commerce commission have estimate out of pocket cost and apportion residue cost suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment be questionable but in any event full credit should be give to the cost section for it express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignore in utility cost analysis namely that between a cost allocation design to reflect the actual behavior of cost in response to change in rat of output of different class of utility service and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spread among the class and unit of service even those cost that be strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination the single step type we turn now to a type of fully distribute cost analysis which unlike the railroad type draw no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment the single step type it might be call the public utility type because of the considerable use to which it have be put in gas and electric utility rate case here no attempt be make first to determine out of pocket or marginal cost and then to superimpose on these cost reasonably distribute residue of total cost instead all of the total cost be treat a variable cost although these cost be divide into cost that be deem to be function of different variable moreover whereas in interstate commerce commission parlance variable cost mean a cost deem to vary in direct proportion to change in rate of output in the type of analysis now under review variable cost have be use more broadly so a to cover cost which while a function of some one variable such a output of energy or number of customer be not necessarily a linear function a already note in an early paragraph the more familiar cost analysis of utility enterprise or utility system divide the total cost among a number of major class of service such a residential commercial industrial power street light etc this grand division permit many cost to be assign in their entirety to some one class such a street light or at least to be exclude completely from some important class or class high tension industrial power service for example would not be charge with any share of the maintenance cost or capital cost of the low tension distribution line but the major portion of the total cost of a utility business be common or joint to all or nearly all class of customer and these cost must somehow be apportion among the various class and then must somehow be reapportion among the unit of service in order to report unit cost that can serve a tentative measure of reasonable rat the general basis on which these common cost be assign to differently measure unit of service will be illustrate by the follow highly simplify problem of an electric utility cost analysis but before turn to this example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong to the single step type rather than to the double step type in the first subtype the analyst follow the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect distribute both total operate cost and total annual capital cost include an allowance for cost of capital or fair rate of return among the different class and unit of service here an apportionment say of of the total cost to residential service a a class would include an allowance of perhaps per cent a the cost of whatever capital be deem to have be devote to the service of the residential consumer but in the second subtype which i take to be the one more frequently apply only the operate expense and not the cost of capital or fair return be apportion directly among the various class of service to be sure the capital investment in or alternatively the estimate fair value of the plant and equipment be apportion among the different class a be also the gross revenue receive from the sale of the different service but any result excess of revenue receive from a give class of service over the operate cost impute to this class be report a a return realize on the capital investment attribute to the same service thus during any give year a if the revenue from the residential service be b if the operate expense impute to this class of service come to and c if the net investment in or value of the plant and equipment deem devote to this service amount to the cost analyst will report that residential service in the aggregate have yield a return of or per cent other service will show different rat of return some probably much lower and some high there be obvious reason of convenience for this practice of exclude cost of capital from the direct apportionment of annual cost among the different class of service notably the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be hold to constitute cost of capital or fair rate of return but the practice be likely to be mislead since it may seem to support a conclusion that a long a the revenue from any class of service cover the impute operate expense plus some return on capital investment however low the rat of charge for this service be compensatory needle to say any such inference would be quite unwarranted for the reason just suggest i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distribute cost apportionment in the follow simplify example that be to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assume to be include directly in the cost apportionment three part analysis of the cost of an electric utility business in order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportion cost analysis let u assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supply a single city with power generate by it own steam generation plant let u also assume the existence of only one class or type of service all of which be supply at the same voltage phase etc to residential commercial and industrial customer this latter assumption will permit u to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis the distinction among cost that be function of output of the same service measure along different dimension since the company under review be supply what we be here regard a only one kind of service we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple indeed that it would be limit to a find of the total annual operate and capital cost of the business follow by a calculation of this total in term of annual cost per kilowatt hour of consumption in fact however the problem be not so simple for a statement of cost per kilowatt hour would ignore the fact that many of these cost be not a function of kilowatt hour output or consumption of energy a recognition of multiple cost function be therefore require the simple division and the one most frequently use with subdivision in gas and electric rate case be a threefold division of the total operate and capital cost into customer cost energy or volumetric cost and demand or capacity cost if this threefold division of cost be to have it counterpart in the actual rat of charge for service a it actually do have in some rat there would result a three part rate for any one class of service for example the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a customer charge a charge for kilowatt hour of energy at per kilowatt hour and a charge for a maximum demand of kilowatt during the month at the rate of per kilowatt a total bill of for that month but our present interest lie in the measurement of cost of service and only indirectly in rat that may or may not be design to cover these cost let u therefore consider each of the three type of cost in turn recognize that this simplify classification be use only for illustrative purpose cost actually vary in much more complex way the customer cost these be those operate and capital cost find to vary with number of customer regardless or almost regardless of power consumption include a a minimum be the cost of meter and bill along with whatever other expense the company must incur in take on another consumer these minimum cost may come to per month more or less for residential and small commercial customer although they be substantially high for large industrial user who require more costly connection and meter device while cost on this order be sometimes separately charge for in residential and commercial rat in the form of a mere service charge they be more frequently wholly or partly cover by a minimum charge which entitle the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no far payment but the really controversial aspect of customer cost imputation arise because of the cost analyst s frequent practice of include not just those cost that can be definitely earmark a incur for the benefit of specific customer but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital cost of the secondary low voltage distribution system a fraction equal to the estimate annual cost of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity
cj51,cj51,informative,learned,2257,the precondition of sociology have remain largely unexamined by the sociologist like primitive number in mathematics the entire axiological framework be take to rest upon it operational worth but what be the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduce the idea of physical model be it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible mean can be assign to the most sacred canon in social science it have become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of value by erect mathematical and physical model be itself a condition response to a world which pay a premium price for technological manipulation this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurement of parameter involve in differential equation have lead sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to mean a small group in which certain relation between all pair of individual in such a group can be study cf rapoport ch here i think the role of the philosopher become apparent the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small group need to be question for if the small group notion involve the implicit claim that the phenomenon of sociological investigation be of atomic or subatomic proportion the philosopher need to know the extent to which such entity be valid the mere exploration of the unconscious grind of present day sociology offer a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation cf brodbeck ch a parallel function for philosophy be the study of the relation between perception experientially receive and conception logically form philosophy can supply adequate criterion of mean in the selection of socially viable category this involve a sift of the empirical and rational element enter into each social science statement merton s functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different culture yet it be perfectly clear a nagel and hempel indicate that the concept of function in sociology have be build up from physiological and biological model in which the notion of teleology i e metaphysical purpose be central cf chapter functionalism a a sociological credo be therefore not a direct consequence of observation but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment the purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology be not to tyrannize but to clarify the principle of social science it be absurd to speak of philosophy a a superior enterprise to sociology since the former be a logical rational discipline where sociology be essentially descriptive and empirical such a position entail the negation of philosophy in it platonic form a something soar above and embrace the empirical and mathematical science but contrary to whitehead philosophy be not a synonym for plato the us of philosophy a a logical clear house be manifest to any approach that do not descend to pure sensationalism however when philosophy attempt to stand above the science to dictate the condition of empirical research it become formal metaphysics shape the contour of life to fit the need of legend the notion of philosophy a queen bee may fit well with authoritarian mode of political ideology but it have be note that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy be the frustration and flagellation of the social science cf wet pt ch horowitz b metaphysics be no long a direct grappling with nature a it be in antiquity it have surrender any claim of description in favor of psychological account of nothingness a in heidegger s system science be mock for wish to know nothing of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the god at the expense of men it be not positivism which have isolate metaphysics from reality by distinguish between description and prescription it be simply reveal the state to which metaphysical think have fall during this century consider the traditional four field of philosophy logic ethic epistemology and esthetic it be a commonplace that to the degree these special preserve of past philosophic hunt ground establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criterion they move away from philosophy a such what be leave to traditional system of philosophy be in effect only the history of these field prior to their become rigorous enough to abide by the canon of scientific method in this situation philosophy have survive by separate itself from metaphysics by show the ultimate question to be the meaningless question the relinquish by philosophy of pretentious claim to empirical priority give it an ability to treat problem of mean and truth which in the past it be unable to examine because of it missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sort in the new situation philosophy be able to provide the social science with the same guidance that mathematics offer the physical science a reservoir of logical relation that can be use in frame hypothesis have explanatory and predictive value beyond this philosophy may urge the social science forward by ask the type of question that fall outside the present scope of social inquiry but within it potential domain of relevance in this connection it might be note that the theory of game be a mathematical discovery long before it us in political science be exploit likewise kant formulate the nebular hypothesis accord to which the solar system be evolve from a rotate mass of incandescent gas nearly a half century before it scientific value be make plain by laplace in his systeme du monde this do not mean that philosophy resolve the problem it generate any more so than riemann s geometry settle the physical status of the space time continuum but the forceful presentation of new issue for the science to work on be itself a monumental task to those raise on marcel s homo viator and heidegger s da nichtige this may seem a modest role for philosophy however modesty and triviality be different quality philosophy conceive of a servant to the science might appear a less dramatic than philosophy which jeer a the science evolve the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind have traverse since it primitive anthropological status offer a more durable sort of drama by clarify fundamental premise in the social science and define the logical problem emergent at the borderland of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understand philosophy can prevent the work scientist from become slothful and self content by note the assumption and level at which a hypothesis or theory be frame the dissection of scientific theory the examination of a theory from the vantage point of language epistemology and ethic be itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less so because of it removal from empirical research the realm of science whatever the degree of precision in formulation cover the range of prediction and explanation cf hempel and oppenheim whatever philosophy be conceive to be it rationalist logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it be something other than science for some form of philosophy this very division between the empirical and the rational become a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter bergson and leroy announce that the secret be the center of a philosophy and thereafter a hundred follower declare secrecy a high verity this be simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruce up to look virtuous for a merleau ponty indicate it be not the secret which be important but the removal of secrecy in this philosophy and science share a common goal the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantee that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophy shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument for this division be but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science the mystification of metaphysical system do not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic age which demand metaphysics to be rational and logical the tenacity with which present metaphysical attitude fetishize private intuition offer the strong evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic way of philosophizing be build into the present conflict over the limit and purpose of science religion and ideology cf mcglynn scientific system and this include even the relation of mechanist to relativist physic be build upon refine and correct philosophic system by the very nature of their completeness be overthrow by rival system in addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ in that science be essentially descriptive while philosophy in it inherit form tend to be goal orient teleological and prescriptive the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour be not subject to objective analysis have place intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge since it be precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat belief a social fact no less viable than social behaviour when deal with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or well the role of philosophy in assist research on the social source of idea one have to become necessarily selective certain feature we have touch upon philosophy a a logical deductive system from which a social science methodology can be build up philosophic analysis of the assumption and presumption of the social science and philosophy a a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigation the objection will be raise that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science have be omit namely the status of ultimate value question and norm operative in the social science specifically it will be ask whether the real question people ask be not the ultimate question that social science find itself impotent in the face of what then be the status of such question a be society the grind of human existence or a mean to an individual goal do society develop accord to cosmic pattern or be they subject only to the free choice of individual do society really exist a an entity over and above the agglomeration of men i think it must be say that contrary to metaphysical insistence these be question so frame a to defy either empirical exploration or rational solution a simmel and dilthey indicate question of whether the value of life be individual or social be not question but assertion of faith make to appear a legitimate question such pseudo question assume that answer of concrete significance can be supply to statement involve undefined universal social theory have no more right to expect result from meaningless question than physic have the right to expect a theological solution to the wave particle controversy it be not that such question be not ask it be rather that introduce them into social analysis reflect not so much a search for truth a for certainty an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty since it be certainty which every new discovery in science either replace or reshape to raise the add objection that men require certainty on psychological ground answer to ultimate question have an irrational rather than scientific basis be in a real sense to undermine the objection itself for what concern all scientific discipline be precisely that which can be capture for the rational i e for the scientific determination of what in past age be consider ultimate and irrational a philosophy which attempt to supply ultimate answer in an ultimate way reveal it acquiescence in the shortcoming of men an impatience with partial tentative solution men have always live in a tentative world and in suspension of ultimate judgment where and when necessary uncertainty overcome itself be the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world without such uncertainty we be leave with a set of dogma and myth the functional interplay of philosophy and science should a a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to myth make a degree of indefiniteness be a salutary condition for the growth of science
cj52,cj52,informative,learned,2255,but neither be the statement empirical for goodness be not a quality like red or squeaky that could be see or hear what be they to do then with these awkward judgment of value to find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically and yet that theory be what they regard a their most important discovery it appear that the theory could be save in one way only if it could be show that judgment of good and bad be not judgment at all that they assert nothing true or false but merely express emotion like hurrah or fiddlestick then these wayward judgment would cease from trouble and weary head could be at rest this be the course the positivist take they explain value judgment by explain them away now i do not think their view will do but before discuss it i should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have state their case it have be say of john stuart mill that he write so clearly that he could be find out this theory have be put so clearly and precisely that it deserve criticism of the same kind and this i will do my best to supply the theory claim to show by analysis that when we say that be good we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we be think i shall argue that we do mean to do just that let u work through an example and the simple and common the well there be perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain be bad let u take a set of circumstance in which i happen to be interest on the legislative side and in which i think every one of u might naturally make such a statement we come upon a rabbit that have be catch in one of the brutal trap in common use there be sign that it have struggle for day to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it have all but eat off it own leg the attempt fail the animal be now dead a we think of the long and excruciate pain it must have suffer we be very likely to say it be a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so the positivist tell u that when we say this we be only express our present emotion i hold on the contrary that we mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it be bad bad when and a it occur consider what follow from the positivist view on that view nothing good or bad happen in the case until i come on the scene and make my remark for what i express in my remark be something go on in me at the time and that of course do not exist until i do come on the scene the pain of the rabbit be not itself bad nothing evil be happen when that pain be be endure badness in the only sense in which it be involve at all wait for it appearance till i come and look and felt now that this be at odds with our mean may be show a follow let u put to ourselves the hypothesis that we have not come on the scene and that the rabbit never be discover be we prepare to say that in that case nothing bad occur in the sense in which we say it do clearly not indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident of our late discovery make no difference whatever to the badness of the animal s pain that it would have be every whit a bad whether a chance passer by happen late to discover the body and feel repugnance or not if so then it be clear that in say the suffer be bad we be not express our feel only we be say that the pain be bad when and a it occur and before anyone take an attitude toward it the first argument be thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference it remove our present expression and show that the badness we mean would not be affect by this whereas on positivist ground it should be the second argument apply the method in the reverse way it ideally remove the past event and show that this would render false what we mean to say whereas on positivist ground it should not let u suppose that the animal do not in fact fall into the trap and do not suffer at all but that we mistakenly believe it do and say a before that it suffer be an evil thing on the positivist theory everything i seek to express by call it evil in the first case be still present in the second in the only sense in which badness be involve at all whatever be bad in the first case be still present in it entirety since all that be express in either case be a state of feel and that feel be still there and our question be be such an implication consistent with what we mean clearly it be not if anyone ask u after we make the remark that the suffer be a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we say to learn that the incident have never occur and no pain have be suffer at all we should say that it make all the difference in the world that what we be assert to be bad be precisely the suffer we think have occur back there that if this have not occur there be nothing leave to be bad and that our assertion be in that case mistake the suggestion that in say something evil have occur we be after all make no mistake because we have never mean anyhow to say anything about the past suffer seem to me merely frivolous if we do not mean to say this why should we be so relieve on find that the suffer have not occur on the theory before u such relief would be groundless for in that suffer itself there be nothing bad at all and hence in it nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieve about the positivist theory would here distort our mean beyond recognition so far a i can see there be only one way out for the positivist he hold that goodness and badness lie in feel of approval or disapproval and there be a way in which he might hold that badness do in this case precede our own feel of disapproval without belong to the pain itself the pain in itself be neutral but unfortunately the rabbit on no ground at all take up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that make it for the first time and in the only intelligible sense bad this way of escape be theoretically possible but since it have grave difficulty of it own and have not so far a i know be urge by positivist it be perhaps best not to spend time over it i come now to a third argument which again be very simple when we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about it suffer be a bad thing we presumably make it with some feel the positivist be plainly right in say that such remark do usually express feel but suppose that a week late we revert to the incident in think and make our statement again and suppose that the circumstance have now so change that the feel with which we make the remark in the first place have fade the pathetic evidence be no long before u and we be now so fatigue in body and mind that feel be a we say quite dead in these circumstance since what be express by the remark when first make be on the theory before u simply absent the remark now express nothing it be a empty a the word hurrah would be when there be no enthusiasm behind it and this seem to me untrue when we repeat the remark that such suffer be a bad thing the feel with which we make it last week may be at or near the vanish point but if we be ask whether we mean to say what we do before we should certainly answer yes we should say that we make our point with feel the first time and little or no feel the second time but that it be the same point we be make and if we can see that what we mean to say remain the same while the feel vary from intensity to near zero it be not the feel that we primarily mean to express i come now to a fourth consideration we all believe that toward act or effect of a certain kind one attitude be fit and another not but on the theory before u such a belief would not make sense broad and ross have lately contend that this fitness be one of the main fact of ethic and i suspect they be right but that be not exactly my point my point be this whether there be such fitness or not we all assume that there be and if we do we express in moral judgment more than the subjectivist say we do let me illustrate in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky tell of his experience in a siberian prison camp whatever the unhappy inmate of such camp be like today dostoevsky s companion be about a grim a lot a can be imagine i have hear story he write of the most terrible the most unnatural action of the most monstrous murder tell with the most spontaneous childishly merry laughter most of u would say that in this delight at the kill of others or the cause of suffer there be something very unfit if we be ask why we think so we should say that these thing involve great evil and be wrong and that to take delight in what be evil or wrong be plainly unfit now on the subjectivist view this answer be rule out for before someone take up an attitude toward death suffer or their infliction they have no moral quality at all there be therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fit they be in themselves neutral and so far a they get a moral quality they get it only through be invest with it by the attitude of the onlooker but if that be true why be any attitude more fit than any other would applause for example be fit if apart from the applause there be nothing good to applaud would condemnation be fit if independently of the condemnation there be nothing bad to condemn in such a case any attitude would be a fit or unfit a any other which mean that the notion of fitness have lose all point indeed we be force to go much far if goodness and badness lie in attitude only and hence be bring into be by them those men who greet death and misery with childishly merry laughter be take the only sensible line if there be nothing evil in these thing if they get their moral complexion only from our feel about them why shouldn t they be greet with a cheer to greet them with repulsion would turn what before be neutral into something bad it would needlessly bring badness into the world and even on subjectivist assumption that do not seem very bright on the other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before be neutral into something good it would bring goodness into the world
cj53,cj53,informative,learned,2327,the injure german veteran be a former miner twenty four year old who have be wound by shrapnel in the back of the head this result in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the leave side of the cerebellum also in any event the extraordinary result of this injury be that he become psychically blind while at the same time apparently the sense of touch remain essentially intact psychical blindness be a condition in which there be a total absence of visual memory image a condition in which for example one be unable to remember something just see or to conjure up a memory picture of the visible appearance of a well know friend in his absence this circumstance in the patient s case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remain basically in sound work order constitute it exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence present by the author be overwhelm that when the patient close his eye he have absolutely no spatial that be third dimensional awareness whatsoever the necessary inference a the author themselves interpret it would seem to be this spatial quality be not among those grasp by the sense of touch a such we do not arrive at spatial image by mean of the sense of touch by itself spatiality become part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representation that be there be in the true sense only a visual space the underlie assumption of course be that only sight and touch enable u in any precise and fully dependable way to locate object in space beyond u the other sens be decidedly inferior if not totally inadequate in this regard this be an assumption with which few would be dispose to quarrel therefore if the sense of touch be function normally and there be a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eye be close and an object be handle the conclusion seem unavoidable that touch by itself can not focus and take possession of the third dimensionality of thing and that actual sight or visual representation be necessary the force of the author analysis if indeed it have any force can be felt by the reader i believe only after three question have be successfully answer what allow u to think that the patient have no third dimensional representation when his eye be close what evidence be there that he be psychically blind how can we be sure that his sense of touch be not profoundly disturb by his head injury we shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation obviously a satisfactory answer to the third question be imperative if the argument be to get under way at all for if there be any possibility of doubt whether the patient s tactual sensitivity have be impair by the occipital lesion any find whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course a evidence to establish the desire conclusion the answer the author give to it therefore be of supreme importance it be a follow the usual sensitivity test show that the specific quality of skin perceptiveness pressure pain temperature a well a the kinesthetic sensation muscular feel feel in the tendon and joint be a such essentially intact although they seem in comparison with normal reaction to be somewhat diminish over the entire body the suppose tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member a well a the direction and scope of a movement passively execute with one of his member prove to have be on the contrary very considerably affect the author insist however that these abnormality in the sense of touch be due absolutely to no organic disorder in that sense faculty but rather to the injury which the patient have sustain to the sense of sight first of all what be their evidence that the tactual apparatus be fundamentally undamaged when an object be place in the patient s hand he have no difficulty determine whether it be warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth flexible soft or hard and he could tell simply by the feel of it whether it be make of wood iron cloth rubber and so on and he could recognize by touch alone article which he have handle immediately before even though they be altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identify by him that be he be unaware what kind of object they be or what their use be the patient attain an astonish efficiency in a new trade because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffer to his sight the patient have to train himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio maker an occupation require a great deal of precision in the make of measurement and a fairly well develop sense of form and contour it seem clear when one take into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question the one concern the psychical blindness of the patient that he have to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty be most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision and so the author conclude the conduct of the patient in his every day life and in his work even more than the forego fact mention above under leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word be unaffected or to put the same thing in physiological term that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to the tactual center in the brain that be from one end to the other be unimpaired if the argument be accept a essentially sound up to this point it remain for u to consider whether the patient s difficulty in orient himself spatially and in locate object in space with the sense of touch can be explain by his defective visual condition but before we can do this we must first find answer to our original question and then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand in what way then do the patient s psychical blindness manifest itself he could not see object a unify self contain and organize figure a a person do with normal vision the mean of this a we shall see be that he have no fund of visual memory image of object a object and therefore he could not recognize even long familiar thing upon see them again instead he constantly become lose in part and component of them confuse some of their detail with those of neighbor object and so on unless he allow time to trace the object in question through minute movement of the head and hand and in this way to discover it contour accord to his own testimony he never actually saw thing a shape but only a generally amorphous blot of color of a more or less indefinite size at their edge they slip pretty much out of focus altogether but by the trace procedure he could in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form could piece a it be the jumble mass together into an organize whole and then recognize it a a man or a triangle or whatever it turn out to be if however the figure to be discern be complicate compose of several interlock subfigure and so on even the trace process fail him and he could not focus even relatively simple shape among it part this mean concretely that the patient could not read at all without make write like movement of the head or body become easily confuse by hasher mark insert between hand write word and thus confuse the mark for one of the letter and could recognize a simple straight line or a curve one only by trace it the patient himself deny that he have any visual imagery at all and there be ample evidence of the follow sort to corroborate him after a conversation with another man he be able to recount practically everything that have be say but could not describe at all what the other man look like nor could he call up memory picture of close friend or relative in short both his own declaration and his figural blindness when he look at object seem to present undeniable evidence that he have simply no visual memory at all he be oblivious of the form of the object actually be view precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learn and hold in visual memory a person of normal vision do he could not recognize it he be absolutely unfamiliar with it because he have no visual memory at all therefore his only recourse be to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object and this he could do only by go over it mass with the trace procedure then he might finally recognize it apparently by combine the visual blot actually be see with tactual feel in the head or body accompany the trace movement this would mean it can readily be see that again for each new visual experience the trace motion would have to be repeat because of the absence of visual imagery a one would surmise the procedure however could be repeat with the same object or with the same type of object often enough so that the correspond visual blot and the merest begin of the trace movement would provide clue a to the actual shape which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference men tree automobile house and so on object continually confront in everyday life have each it characteristic blot appearance and become easily recognizable at the very begin of trace by an inference a to what each be dice for example he infer from black dot on a white surface he evidently could not actually see the corner of these object but their size and the dot give them away and the author give numerous instance of calculate guess on the patient s part to show how large a role it play in his process of readapt himself and how proficient he become at it often he seem even to have be able to guess correctly without the trace motion solely on the basis of qualitative difference among the blot like thing which appear in his visual experience perhaps the very important question what be then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensation in the patient s ability to recognize form and shape by mean of the trace movement when he be actually look at thing have now be raise in the reader s mind and in the follow form if the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he can not perceive it visually then it would seem the sense of touch have immediate contact with the spatial aspect of thing in independence of visual representation at least in regard to two dimension and a we shall see even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch be deny by the author how then do the kinesthetic sensation function in all this the author set about answer this fundamental question through a detail investigation of the patient s ability tactually to perceive figure and to locate object in space with his eye close or turn away from the object concern quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibit the patient from make any movement at all and then late by repeat it and allow the patient to move in any way he want to when the patient be not allow to move his body in any way at all the follow strike result occur
cj54,cj54,informative,learned,2255,whenever artist indeed turn to actual representation or mold three dimensional figure which be rare down to b c they tend to reflect reality see plate a b a schematic abstract treatment of men and animal by intent rise only in the late eighth century to speak of this underlie view of the world be to embark upon matter of subjective judgment at the least however one may conclude that geometric potter sense a logical order their principle of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epic and the hexameter line their world again be a still simple traditional age which be only slowly begin to appreciate the complexity of life and perhaps an observer of the vas will not go too far in deduce that the outlook of their maker and user be basically stable and secure the storm of the past have die away and the great upheaval which be to mark the follow century have not yet begin to disturb men s mind throughout the work of the late ninth century a calm severe serenity display itself in the vas this spirit may perhaps at time bore or repel one in it internal self satisfaction but the best of the geometric pin have rightly be consider among the most beautiful ever make in the greek world the ninth century be in it artistic work the spiritually free and most self sufficient between past and future and the love skill spend by it artist upon their product be a testimonial to their sense that what they be do be important and be appreciate the aegean in b c geometric pottery have not yet receive the thorough detail study which it deserve partly because the task be a mammoth one and partly because some of it local manifestation a at argo be only now come to light from even a cursory inspection of it many aspect however the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusion about the progress of the aegean world down to b c the general intellectual outlook which have appear in the eleventh century be now consolidate to a significant degree much which be in embryo in have become reasonably well develop by in this process the minoan mycenaean inheritance have be transmute or finally reject the aegean world which have exist before differ from that which rise more clearly in our vision after those modern scholar who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from early time grant occasional irruption of people and idea from outside be correct but all too many observer have be mislead by this fact into minimize the degree of change which take place in the early first millennium the focus of novelty in this world now lay in the south eastern district of the greek mainland and by virtually the entire aegean always except it northern shore have accept the geometric style of pottery while protogeometric vas usually turn up especially outside greece proper together with a many or more example of local stamp these non greek pattern have mostly vanish by the late ninth century in their place come local variation within the common style tentative a it be in protogeometric product but truly distinct and sharply define a the geometric spirit develop attica though important be not the only teacher of this age one can take a vase of about b c and without any knowledge of it place of origin venture to assign it to a specific area imitation and borrowing of motif now become ascertainable the potter of the aegean island thus stand apart from those of the mainland and in greece itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric sequence have each their own hallmark these local variation be to become ever sharp in the next century and a half the same conclusion can be draw from the other physical evidence of the dark age from linguistic distribution and from the survival of early social political and religious pattern into late age by b c the aegean be an area of common tongue and of common culture on these pillar rest that solid basis for life and think which be soon to be manifest in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad everywhere within the common pattern however one find local diversity greek history and culture be enduringly fertilize and plague by the interplay of these conjoin yet oppose factor far we can not go for the dark age deserve their name many aspect of civilization be not yet sufficiently crystallize to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundation of this world support a lofty structure the epic poem the consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise of firm political unit the self awareness which could permit paint and sculpture representation of men all these have to await the progress of follow decade what we have see in this chapter we have see only dimly and yet the result however general be worth the search these be the century in which the inhabitant of the aegean world settle firmly into their mind and into their institution the foundation of the hellenic outlook independent of outside force to interpret indeed the era from to a a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect bear of our lack of detail information if we could see more deeply we probably would find many side issue and wrong turn which come to an end within the period the historian can only point out those line which be major enough to find reflection in our limit evidence and must hope that future excavation will enrich our understand throughout the dark age it be clear the greek world have be develop slowly but consistently the pace could now be accelerate for the inhabitant of the aegean stand on firm grind chapter the early eighth century the landscape of greek history broaden widely and rather abruptly in the eighth century b c the age of homer s rosy finger dawn the first slant ray of the new day can not yet dispel all the dark shadow which lie across the aegean world but our evidence grow considerably in variety and show more unmistakably some of the line of change for this period a for early century pottery remain the most secure source the ceramic material of the age be more abundant more diversify and more indicative of the hop and fear of it maker who begin to show scene of human life and death figurine and simple chapel presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece object in gold ivory and bronze grow more numerous since write be practice in the aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the detail of tradition will now be occasionally useful though it be not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous product of the epic tradition have certainly take definitive shape by the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad be amaze manifestation of the inherent potentiality of greek civilization but both be among the last product of a phase which be ending greek civilization be swirl toward it great revolution in which the develop quality of the hellenic outlook be suddenly to break forth the revolution be well under way before b c and premonitory sign go back virtually across the century the era however be janus face while many token point forward the main achievement stand a a culmination of the simple pattern of the dark age the dominant pottery of the century be geometric political organization revolve about the basileus trade be just begin to expand the god who protect the greek countryside be only now put on their sharply anthropomorphic dress the modern student who know what be to come next be likely to place first the factor of change which be visible in the eighth century not all men of the period would have accept this emphasis many potter cling to the past the more determinedly a they be confront with radically new idea the poet of the iliad deliberately archaize although it be not possible to sunder old and new in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decade of the eighth century and shall interpret them a an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture society and politics for the development in these area make sense only if they be connect to the age of revolution itself the grow contact between aegean and orient be also a phase which should be link primarily to the remarkable broaden of hellenic culture after we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connection to the east a we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece the important point however be that these magnificent achievement unlike those of late decade be only incidentally influence by oriental model the antecedent of dipylon vas and of the iliad lie in the aegean past dipylon pottery the pottery of the first half of the eighth century be commonly call ripe geometric the severe yet harmonious vas of the previous fifty year the strong geometric style of the late ninth century display a firm a mastery of the principle underlie geometric pottery but artist now be ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance the vas which result have different shape far more complex decoration and a large sense of style beyond the aesthetic and technical aspect of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broad line in early century men have have enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos they have have to work on very simple foundation and have not dare to give rein to impulse the potter in particular have virtually eschew freehand draw elaborate motif and the curve line of nature while yet express a belief that there be order in the universe in their vas be embody the basic aesthetic and logical characteristic of greek civilization at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently in the initial stage of the geometric style by social and cultural security have be achieve at least on a simple plane it be time to take big step to venture on experiment ripe geometric potter continue to employ the old syntax of ornament and shape and make use of the well define though limit range of motif which they have inherit in these respect the vas of the early eighth century represent a culmination of early line of progress to the ancestral lore however new material be add painter leave less and less of a vase in a plain dark color instead they divide the surface into many band or cover it by all over pattern into which freehand draw begin to creep wavy line feather like pattern rosette of indefinitely floral nature bird either singly or in stylize row animal in solemn frieze band see plate all these turn up in the more develop fabric a preliminary sign that the potter be broaden their gaze the row of animal and bird in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal frieze transmit perhaps via syrian silver bowl and textile but the specific form of these row on local vas and metal product be nonetheless greek though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean have not yet be precisely determine it seem to appear first in the cyclades which be among the lead exporter of pottery throughout the century a the material at the command of the potter grow and the volume of their production increase the local variation within a common style become more evident plate illustrate four example which be ripe or late geometric work of common spirit but of different school

cj57,cj57,informative,learned,2239,some who have write on utopia have treat it a a learn diversion of a learn world a phantasy with which more amuse himself a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirit a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention with respect to this view two point be worth make first it appear to be base on the fact that on it title page utopia be describe a festivus gay it overlook the other fact that it be describe a nec minus salutaris quam festivus no less salutary than gay it also overlook the fact that in a rational lexicon and quite clearly in more s lexicon the opposite of serious be not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay be not serious but solemn more believe that a man could be both serious and gay that a writer who be gay can not be serious be a common professional illusion sedulously foster by all too many academic who mistakenly believe that their frivolous effort should be take seriously because they be express with that dreary solemnity which be the only mode of expression their author be capable of secondly to find a learn diversion and a please joke in more s account of the stupid brutality of early sixteenth century war of the anguish of the poor and dispossess of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful require a callousness toward suffer and sin that would be surprise in a moral imbecile and most surprise in more himself indeed it be even surprise in the canon of christ church and regius professor of ecclesiastical history who father this most peculiar view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance english at cambridge who inherit it and be now it most eminent proponent but to return to the main line of our inquiry it be doubtful that utopia be still widely read because more be medieval or even because he be a martyr indeed it be likely that these day many who read utopia with interest do not even know that it author be a martyr utopia be still widely read because in a sense more stand on the margin of modernity and if he do stand on the margin of modernity it be not in die a martyr for such unity a papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom it be not even in write latin epigram sometimes bawdy one or in translate lucian from greek into latin or in defend the study of greek against the attack of conservative academic or in attack the conservative theologian who oppose erasmus s philological study of the new testament similar literary exercise be the common do of a christian humanist of the first two decade of the sixteenth century have more s write be wholly limit to such exercise they would be almost a dimly remember a those of a dozen or so other author live in his time whose work tenuously survive in the mind of the few hundred scholar who each decade in pursuit of their very specialize occasion read those work more stand on the margin of modernity for one reason alone because he write utopia and the evidence that he do indeed stand there derive quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual reader have respond to that book for the past century or so only one other contemporary of more s evoke so immediate and direct a response and only one other contemporary work niccolo machiavelli and the prince can we discover what it be in utopia that have evoke this response remember that in seek the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there we do not even need to commit ourselves to assess on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval the renaissance and the modern the medieval be the most important to chamber because he seek to place thomas more the author of utopia in some intelligible relation with st thomas more the martyr to others whose concern it be to penetrate the significance of christian humanism the renaissance element be of primary concern but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation we want to know why that book have keep on sell the way it have we want to know what be perennially new about utopia what be new about it to that question the answer be simple it can be make in two word utopian communism but it be an answer which open the door wide to an onrush of objection and denial surely there be nothing new about communism we find it in plato s republic and in utopia more acknowledge his debt to that book we find it in that common way of life please to christ and still in use among the true society of christian that be the well monastery which make it easy to convert the utopian to christianity we find it in the late stoic conception of man s natural condition which include the community of all possession this conception be take up by the early church father and by canon lawyer and theologian in the middle age and more be far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the form thus give it but although the idea of communism be very old even in more s day and do not spring full clothe from his imagination in it be not communism a such that we be concern with we be concern not with the genus communism nor with other specie of the genus platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological communism we be concern with utopian communism that be simply communism a it appear in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia a more conceive it perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of utopian communism be to contrast it with the principal early type of communistic theory we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it be by realize what it be not in plato s republic communism be to speak anachronistically a communism of janissary it function be to separate from the base rule mass among whom private ownership prevail the govern warrior elite moreover it be too readily forget that in the republic what give the initial impetus to plato s excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with it rule class communism of good wive and child be his quest for a canon for the proper order of the individual human psyche and it be to this problem that the republic ultimately return in more s utopia communism be not a mean of separate out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass utopian communism apply to all utopian and in the economy of the book it be not peripheral but central the concern of utopia be with the optimo reipublicae statu the best order of a civil society and it be again and again make clear that utopian communism provide the institutional array indispensible to that best order to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community of the apostolic age or from it medieval successor in spirit the monastic community be with an appropriate shift of adjective mislead in the same way a to derive it from plato s republic in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athlete in the apostolic and monastic community with an elite of spiritual and religious athlete the apostolic community be literally an elite chosen by christ himself and the monastic community be suppose to be make up of volunteer select only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigor their spiritual athleticism finally the conception of the natural community of all possession which originate with the stoic be firmly fix in a tradition by more s time although it be not accept by all the theologian philosopher of the middle age in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man it do not serve to contrast the exist order of society with a possible alternative order because the age of innocence be not a possible alternative once man have sin the actual function of patristic communism be adequately set forth by st gregory almost a millenium before more write utopia the soil be common to all men when we give the necessity of life to the poor we restore to them what be already theirs we should think of it more a an act of justice than compassion because community not severalty of property be the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what be his indeed of all that be his every man be by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligate to regard himself a a custodian he be a trustee for the common good however feeble the safeguard which the positive or municipal law of property provide against his misuse of that share of the common fund wisely or unwisely entrust to his keep in contrast to this stoic patristic view utopia imply that the nature of man be such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiency of municipal law be to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve the utopian brace conscience with legal sanction in a properly order society the massive force of public law perform the function which in natural law theory ineptly be leave altogether to a small voice so often still in all the respect just indicate utopian communism differ from previous conception in which community of possession and live play a role neither from one of these conception nor from a combination of them can it be deduce we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus find the tale of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greek in a like sense whatever bit or shred of previous conception one may find in it utopian communism remain a an integral whole original a new thing it be not merely a new thing it be one of the very few new thing in utopia most of the rest be medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism but to say that at a moment in history something be new be not necessarily to say that it be modern and for this statement the best evidence come within the five year follow the publication of utopia when martin luther elaborate a new perception of the nature of the divine s encounter with man new indeed be luther s perception but not modern a anyone know who have ever try to make intelligible to modern student what luther be get at although utopian communism be both new in and also modern it be not modern communism or even modern socialism a they exist or have ever exist in theory or in practice consider the feature of utopian communism generous public provision for the infirm democratic and secret election of all officer include priest meal take publicly in common refectory a common habit or uniform prescribe for all citizen even house change once a decade six hour of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrate and scholar and careful measure to prevent anyone from shirk no private property no money no sort of price at all for any good or service and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term whatever the merit of it intent utopian communism be far too naive far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist it be not the detail of utopian communism that make utopia modern it be the spirit the attitude of mind that inform those detail what that spirit and attitude be we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrast with the communist tradition with the long continuous history the one which reach christianity by the way of stoicism through the church father of late antiquity

painting on canvas it be true that his first collage look more analytical than braque s which would confirm the date he assign it but it be also true that braque be the consistent pioneer in the use of simulate texture a well a of typography and moreover he have already begin to broaden and simplify the facet plan of analytical cubism a far back a the end of when we examine what each master say be his first collage we see that much the same thing happen in each it make no real difference that braque s collage be on paper and eked out in charcoal while picasso s be on canvas and eked out in oil by it great corporeal presence and it great extraneousness the affix paper or cloth serve for a seem moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulate printing or simulate texture have ever do but here again the surface declare device both overshoot and fall short of it aim for the illusion of depth create by the contrast between the affix material and everything else give way immediately to an illusion of form in ba relief which give way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seem to contain both or neither because of the size of the area it cover the paste paper establish undepicted flatness bodily a more than an indication or sign literal flatness now tend to assert itself a the main event of the picture and the device boomerang the illusion of depth be render even more precarious than before instead of isolate the literal flatness by specify and circumscribe it the paste paper or cloth release and spread it and the artist seem to have nothing leave but this undepicted flatness with which to finish a well a start his picture the actual surface become both grind and background and it turn out suddenly and paradoxically that the only place leave for a three dimensional illusion be in front of upon the surface in their very first collage braque and picasso draw or paint over and on the affix paper or cloth so that certain of the principal feature of their subject a depict seem to thrust out into real ba relief space or to be about to do so while the rest of the subject remain imbed in or flat upon the surface and the surface be drive back in it very surfaceness only by this contrast in the upper center of braque s first collage fruit dish in douglas cooper s collection a bunch of grape be render with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect a to lift it practically off the picture plane the trompe l oeil illusion here be no long enclose between parallel flatness but seem to thrust through the surface of the draw paper and establish depth on top of it yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strip paste to the paper and the only less immediacy of block capital that simulate window letter manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it do not jump at the same time the wallpaper strip themselves seem to be push into depth by the line and patch of shade charcoal upon them and by their place in relation to the block capital and these capital seem in turn to be push back by their place and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining thus every part and plane of the picture keep change place in relative depth with every other part and plane and it be a if the only stable relation leave among the different part of the picture be the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each have with the surface and the same thing more or less can be say of the content of picasso s first collage in late collage of both master a variety of extraneous material be use sometimes in the same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye deceive and eye undeceive device they can think of the area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affix material or simply of a paint in form will be shade to pry that edge away from the surface while something will be draw paint or even paste over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth plan define a parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth be suggest optically which be great than that establish pictorially all this expand the oscillation between surface and depth so a to encompass fictive space in front of the surface a well a behind it flatness may now monopolize everything but it be a flatness become so ambiguous and expand a to turn into illusion itself at least an optical if not properly speak a pictorial illusion depict cubist flatness be now almost completely assimilate to the literal undepicted kind but at the same time it react upon and largely transform the undepicted kind and it do so moreover without deprive the latter of it literalness rather it underpin and reinforce that literalness re create it out of this re create literalness the cubist subject reemerged for it have turn out by a far paradox of cubism that the mean to an illusion of depth and plasticity have now become widely divergent from the mean of representation or imaging in the analytical phase of their cubism braque and picasso have not only have to minimize three dimensionality simply in order to preserve it they have also have to generalize it to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief become abstract from specific three dimensional entity and be render largely a the illusion of depth and relief a such a a disembody attribute and expropriate property detach from everything not itself in order to be save plasticity have have to be isolate and a the aspect of the subject be transpose into those cluster of more or less interchangeable and contour obliterate facet plan by which plasticity be isolate under the cubist method the subject itself become largely unrecognizable cubism in it phase which the french with justice call hermetic be on the verge of abstract art it be then that picasso and braque be confront with a unique dilemma they have to choose between illusion and representation if they opt for illusion it could only be illusion per se an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstract a to exclude the representation of individual object if on the other hand they opt for representation it have to be representation per se representation a image pure and simple without connotation at least without more than schematic one of the three dimensional space in which the object represent originally exist it be the collage that make the term of this dilemma clear the representational could be restore and preserve only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation have become for the first time mutually exclusive alternative in the end picasso and braque plump for the representational and it would seem they do so deliberately this provide whatever real justification there be for the talk about reality but the inner formal logic of cubism a it work itself out through the collage have just a much to do with shape their decision when the small facet plan of analytical cubism be place upon or juxtapose with the large dense shape form by the affix material of the collage they have to coalesce become synthesize into large planar shape themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane leave in their previous atom like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly into depth and the broad opaque shape of paste paper would have be isolate in such a way a to make them jump out of plane large plan juxtapose with other large plan tend to assert themselves a independent shape and to the extent that they be flat they also assert themselves a silhouette and independent silhouette be apt to coincide with the recognizable contour of the subject from which a picture start if it do start from a subject it be because of this chain reaction a much a for any other reason that be because of the grow independence of the planar unit in collage a a shape that the identity of depict object or at least part of them re emerge in braque s and picasso s papiers colles and continue to remain more conspicuous there but only a flatten silhouette than in any of their painting do wholly in oil before the end of analytical cubism come to an end in the collage but not conclusively nor do synthetic cubism fully begin there only when the collage have be exhaustively translate into oil and transform by this translation do cubism become an affair of positive color and flat interlock silhouette whose legibility and placement create allusion to if not the illusion of unmistakable three dimensional identity synthetic cubism begin with picasso alone late in or early in this be the point at which he finally take the lead in cubist innovation away from braque never again to relinquish it but even before that picasso have glimpse and enter for a moment a certain revolutionary path in which no one have precede him it be a though in that instant he have felt the flatness of collage a too constrict and have suddenly try to escape all the way back or forward to literal three dimensionality this he do by use utterly literal mean to carry the forward push of the collage and of cubism in general literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane some time in picasso cut out and fold a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar to this he glue and fit other piece of paper and four taut string thus create a sequence of flat surface in real and sculptural space to which there cling only the vestige of a picture plane the affix element of collage be extrude a it be and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a ba relief
cj60,cj60,informative,learned,2276,los angeles in finally bow to the skyscraper and without high density in the core rapid transit system can not be maintain economically let alone build from scratch at today s price however the build of freeway and garage can not continue forever the new interchange among the four los angeles freeway include the grade construct access occupy by itself no less than eighty acre of downtown land one eighth of a square mile an area about the size of rockefeller center in new york it be hard to believe that this mass of intertwine concrete constitute what the law call the high and best use of centrally locate urban land a it affect the city s fiscal situation such an interchange be ruinous it remove forever from the tax roll property which should be tax to pay for the city service subway improve land value without take away land freeway boost valuation less because the garage they require be not prime build by a long shoot and reduce the acreage that can be tax downtown los angeles be already two third freeway interchange street parking lot and garage one of those preposterous if statistic have already come to pass the freeway with narrowly space interchange concentrate and mitigate the access problem but it also act inevitably a an artificial isolate boundary city planner do not always use this boundary a effectively a they might less ambitious freeway plan may be more successful especially when the roadway and interchange be raise allow for cross access at many point and provide parking area below the ramp meanwhile the automobile and it friend the truck have cost the central city some of it industrial dominance in ever great number factory be locate in the suburb or in industrial park remove from the city s political jurisdiction the appeal of the suburb be particularly strong for heavy industry which must move bulky object along a lengthy assembly line and want enough land area to do the entire job on one floor to light industry the economy of be on one floor be much slight but efficiency engineer usually believe in them and manufacturer look for way to cut cost can not be prevent from turn to efficiency engineer this movement of industry away from the central city be not so catastrophically new a some prophet seem to believe it be merely the late example of the leapfrog growth which form the pattern of virtually all american city the big factory which be relatively near the center of our city the rubber factory in akron chrysler s detroit plant u s steel s pittsburgh work often begin on these sit at a time when that be the edge of the city yet close to transport river storage pier and power river the leapfrog be a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine and the time when the belt of residence surround the old factory area be not yet blight the truck and the car give the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in select his plant site until internal combustion become cheap he have to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an exist large community of lower class home the railroad siding be still important it be usually though not always true that long haul shipment by rail be cheap than trucking but anybody who promise a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these day and many business can live without the railroad and there be now many million of worker for whom the factory with the big parking lot which can be reach by drive across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille route bus line be actually more convenient than the walk to factory willow run general electric s enormous installation at louisville and syracuse the pentagon boeing in seattle douglas and lockheed in los angeles the new automobile assembly plant everywhere none of these be substantially serve by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit they be all suburban plant rely on the road to keep them supply with worker and wherever the new thruway go up their bank be line by neat glass and metal and color brick light industry the drive along massachusetts route the by pass which make an arc about twenty mile from downtown boston may be a vision of the future the future could be bad the plant along route be mostly well design and nicely set against the new england rock and tree they can even be rather grand like edward land s monument to the astonish success of polaroid but they deny the value of the city the crowd competitive tolerant city the melt pot which give off so many of the most admirable american quality they be segregate business combine again on one site the factory and the office draw their work force from segregate community it be interest to note how many of the plant on massachusetts route draw most of their income either from the government in non competitive cost plus arrangement or from the exploitation of patent which grant at least a partial monopoly while the factory be always the center of the labor market they be often on the city s periphery in spread the factory even far the automobile may not have change to any great extent the growth pattern of the city even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt s motel have be relatively painless the hotel motel demarcation be become hard to find every year what hurt most be the damage the automobile have do to central city retail especially in those city where public transit be feeble some retail of course always spread with the population grocery store drugstore local haberdashery and dress shop candy store and the like but whenever a major purchase be contemplate forty year ago a new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter bonnet a bicycle for junior the family set off for the downtown department store where the selection would be greatest department store congregate in the one hundred per cent location where all the transit line converge these store be still there but the volume of the downtown store have be on a relative decline while in many city the suburban branch sell more and more dry good if the retailer and hotelman s downtown unit sale have be decrease however his dollar volume continue to rise and it be dollar which you put in the bank in most discussion of this phenomenon the figure be substantially inflate no suburban shop center branch not even hudson s vast northland outside detroit do anything like the unit volume of business or carry anything like the variety of merchandise to be find in the home store telephone order distort the picture the suburbanite naturally call a local rather than a central city number if both be list in an advertisement especially if the local call eliminate city sale tax the suburban branch be thereby credit with a sale which would have be make even if it glass door have never open accounting procedure which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branch seem more profitable than they be in many case that statement we break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branch would be turn around if the cost analysis be recalculate on term less prejudicial to the old store fear of the competition always a great motivating force in the american economy make retailer who do not have suburban operation exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival s shiny new branch the fact seem to be that very many large branch store be uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburb be a important a it be downtown and that even highly suburbanize city will support only so many big branch moreover the cost of operation be always high in any new store a the conservative banker who act a controller for retail giant be begin to discover when all have be say however the big branch store remain a major break with history in the development of american retail just a the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car the trip to the shop center may seem far easy than to the downtown department store though both be the same distance from home indeed there be some city where the suburban shop pull customer who be geographically much near to downtown raymond vernon report that resident of east st louis have be drive across the mississippi through the heart of downtown st louis and out to the western suburb for major shop simply because parking be easy at the big branch than it be in the heart of town to the extent that the problem be merely parking an aggressive downtown management like that of lazarus brother in columbus ohio can fight back successfully by build a garage on the lot next door if the distant patron of the suburban branch have be frighten away from downtown by traffic problem however the city store can only pressure the politician to do something about the highway or await the completion of the federal highway program and if the affection for the suburban branch reflect a desire to shop with nice people rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which support the downtown department store the central location may be in serious trouble today accord to land economist homer hoyt shop center and their associate parking lot cover some acre of land which be almost exactly the total land area in all the nation s central business district put together the downtown store continue to offer the great inducement of variety both within it gate and across the street where other department store be immediately convenient for the shopper who want to see what be available before make up her mind if anything may be predict in the quicksilver world of retail it seem likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate child s clothe take the kid downtown be too much of a production household gadgetry and the discount business in big ticket item department store be build on dry good especially lady fashion and in this area in the long run the suburban branch will be hard put to compete against downtown if this analysis be correct the suburban branch will turn out to be what management s cost accountant refuse to acknowledge marginal operation rather than major factor historically in america the appeal of city have be their color and life the variety of experience they offer how ya gon na keep em down on the farm be a question that have to be ask long before they saw paree though american usually live in group segregate by national origin or religious belief they like to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change gloomily foresee by so many urban diagnostician be actually upon u suburb and negro in their book american skyline christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt s new deal be what make the modern suburb a possibility a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanite tend to vote the first superhighway new york s henry hudson and chicago s lake shore san francisco s bay bridge and it approach a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike be build a part of the federal work program which be go to cure the depression at the same time roosevelt s federal housing administration couple with henry morgenthau s cheap money policy permit ordinary lower middle class family to build their own home banker who have be reluctant to lend without well security than the house itself get that security from the u s government householder who have be unable to pick up the burden of short term high interest mortgage find they could borrow for twenty five year at per cent under government aegis
cj61,cj61,informative,learned,2331,before lose itself in the sand of the th century the grand stream of italian renaissance architectural decoration make a last appearance in the brumidi fresco of the capitol rotunda in washington the artistic generation after brumidi be train in the paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tend to overlook greatness of conception where fault and weakness be easy to find but it be a great conception the open ceiling with allegorical and classical figure throw in mass against the sky the close frieze formally divide into historical scene and tightly tie to the stone wall belong in their large order to the line of correggio and his baroque follower the descent may be remote but this be surely the only full scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the unite state constantino brumidi design the decorative scheme a a whole in collaboration with the architect charles u walter at the time when plan be be make to replace the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much large iron structure after many year and many interruption he be able to finish the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze begin with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william penn all but one leg when a tragic accident end his career he leave at his death sketch draw to scale for the rest of the circle these be carry out not too faithfully by filippo costaggini who begin by supply the miss member to the founder of pennsylvania and note in pencil in italian that he begin at this point when costaggini have use up all the sketch thirty six foot of empty frieze be leave over a blank undecorated void plaster in roughcast disfigure the wall of the rotunda until then advise by the architect of the capitol the joint committee for the library traditionally responsible for the work of art in the build order the space clear and paint in fresco to show the peace after the civil war the spanish american war and the birth of aviation to match a nearly a feasible brumidi s technique and composition late the clean and restoration be order first of the old part of the frieze finally of the canopy what follow be therefore a description of three separate undertake the new fresco of the gap and the successive essay in conservation with some discussion of problem that arise in connection with each for the use of student and future restorer a full day by day record be keep of all three undertake complete technical report on what we find and what we do these may be consult in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library of congress the first preliminary be inspect the unfinished length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coat all in bad condition it be decide to strip the whole area down to the brick and to replace the rough coat up to one inch thickness to agree with the old artist preparation with a mortar one part slake lime three part sand to be put on in two layer cartoon be draw full size after sketch have be make to satisfy all the authority there be some difficulty here one have to manage the give subject three diverse recent event so a to make them part of a classical frieze that be a pattern of large figure fill the space with not much else against a blank background moreover all three representation must be squeeze comfortably into little more than the length brumidi allow for each one of his when it be all arrange to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze the cartoon be try in place the scaffolding a confusion of heavy beam hang from the gallery above be strong and safe but obscure visibility nothing could be see from the floor but by move around the gallery one could get glimpse and we be able to decide on some amplification of scale to be sure of match color a well a form piece of cartoon be trace on the roughcast and large sample paint in fresco then leave two month to dry out to their final key late it be gratify to note that they have set so solidly a to be hard to remove when the time come the scaffold be the length of the space to be paint what bit of brumidi and costaggini could be reach at either end seem in good order though the roughish sandy surface be thick with dust wash they come out surprisingly clear and bright it could be see that both artist use a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch and that both follow the traditional italian fresco technique a describe by cennino cennini in the th century and current in italy to this day that be they use opaque color throughout get solid highlight with active lime white painting a secco be much in evidence a brown hatch reinforce and broaden shadow and much of the background be solidly cover with a dark coat this brown be sometimes so rich in medium a to appear to be oil paint in our own practice to have the last intonaco plaster coat thick enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine crack in dry we find that it have to be put on in two layer let the first set awhile before apply the second the mortar be three part sand to two of lime some of the lime that be always on hand in the capitol basement for plaster repair be slake several month for u but to make it stiff of a really putty like consistency to avoid crack we add a little hydrate lime hard on the hand but we could see no other disadvantage i be tell that a mortar long slake might have remain long in condition for painting a it be it take the pigment well for six hour enough for our purpose and hold it firmly in set it be obvious that to match brumidi white must be mix with all but the dark tone lime white hard and brilliant have a tendency to jump away from the other color in dry and also by it capacity to set to preclude the use of ready make gradation so useful in decorative work in old italian practice lime dry and reground bianco sangiovanni enter into such prepare shade for convenience we choose a strong pigment unknown to the early italian or to brumidi titanium oxide reserve the active lime white for high light put on at the end of the day s stint other pigment be mostly raw umber some burn umber and a little yellow ochre this last be probably not in brumidi s palette but be need to take the chill bluish look off the new work next to the old where soften effect of time be see even after thorough clean the use of secco we try to restrict to cover joint experience show however that it be very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven late brumidi and costaggini will be see cop with this same problem we be force a they be to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark area we make it by doerner s recipe five part thoroughly wash cheese curd to one of lime putty grind together they make a strong adhesive which become waterproof in dry figure be take in the new part be finish on the right be the brumidi liberty group a it look after clean operation which have not yet come around to the other end where of costaggini only some foliage have be wash at the point where his work stop one be lead to speculate a to why the empty space be there leave for our century to finish costaggini say it be brumidi s fault in not provide enough material to fill the circle brumidi s son late maintain that costaggini have compress and mutilate his father s design ambitiously covet a bit he could claim for his very own this question might be settle by compare the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimension note presumably in brumidi s hand above the various section of his long preparatory draw which have be keep whosever fault it be evident that brumidi intend to fill out the whole frieze with his history and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of california gold in painting a fresco the handle of wet mortar compel one always to move from top to bottom and from leave to right not to spoil yesterday s work with today s plaster at the very first then brumidi be require by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group to fill in the triangular space above the seat girl on liberty s right before start on the allegorical figure themselves here he put a small man whose miss hand might have leave his function doubtful until comparison with the first sketch show that when the artist come back to the begin this be to be the close figure of the party of forty niner and be to hold a basket one see costaggini s render of the same figure more than thirty foot away the photograph figure of the complete frieze show how have be separate from his fellow in useless isolation for eighty year he have now be give a hand and by juxtaposition and the permission of the committee give a new job to represent the witness of the first flight at kitty hawk in the startlingly bright effect of the first wash lead the committee to order the rest of the brumidi costaggini cycle clean and restore to go with them the fix wooden scaffold be remove and so a to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheel build up from the floor every few day in the early morning a the work progress twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distribute it weight widely on the rotunda pavement support a it be by ancient brick vaulting on this giddy and oscillate platform over fifty foot from the floor after a first dust we begin to wash a most useful tool for wetting the surface without run down be make from a greenhouse mist spray nozzle weld to a hose connection to be use at low water pressure a valve in the handle let u cut the pressure still lower one man spray with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting a second assistant mop with two sponge in part a repeat sponge be need but everywhere we find that water alone be enough to restore the original brightness no soap or other clean agent be use that might bring in unwanted chemical reaction the painting a fresco stand up superbly a little of the secco come off necessary retouch be put on at once altogether we find the craftsmanship first rate especially brumidi s we be greatly help by there be no trace of former restore apparently not more than dust have ever be do and not much of that the plaster be sound the intonaco firmly attach all over and the pigment solidly incorporate with it in all but a few unimportant place the greatest source of trouble be rain which have repeatedly flow from opening above soak the surface and leave streak of dissolve lime very conspicuous even after clean particularly in the land of columbus oglethorpe and the indian and yorktown here the architect refer to the use of the capitol a a public build not a museum request some repaint to maintain decorative effect rather than leave blank unsightly patch these fresco have have no care for eighty year with naked gas jet below and leaky window above enough to ruin wall painting in any medium they have survive in a build long unheated in winter hot and damp under the iron dome in summer
cj62,cj62,informative,learned,2206,those whom i wish to address with this letter be for the most part unknown to me it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i visit your country last spring you be live and work close to the place we saw and the street we walk a american artist it be natural that we would want to meet a many soviet artist a possible this letter might not have be necessary have our effort to meet and talk with you be more successful even though we do not see many of your face it appear now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession hear from those whom we have the fortune to encounter that we have be in your midst i be very please that quite a number of you find way to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reaction and experience in the u s s r i can well understand your curiosity we ourselves be always eager to know how others feel about u and the way in which we live it be my hope that this write message and report will reach you through the good office of the union of soviet artist there should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter pozzatti and i endeavor earnestly to record our impression without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provoke the time span of little more than a month can not entitle me to pose a an expert on anything i saw too much damage be do by expert who have spend even less time if any at all in the u s s r nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment a an artist to assume that the right and responsibility of creative individual be relate to humanity a a whole rather than to specific geo political interest if this attitude be seriously question in the soviet union it do not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which i live be too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical a well a aesthetic point of view it be a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countryman be too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority such a artist in any social order i encounter many question and great interest upon my return from the soviet union about my reaction to that experience that which i find most profound and most disturb appear to evoke a curiously mute reaction almost a if i be talk about something quite unreal apparently this be not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impression of a subject which preoccupy a good deal of their wake moment personal predisposition tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice a well i can not be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue i be equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder shake of the head of those who no long care because they have know it for so long the aggressive disbelief of those who be romantically lose in a semantic jungle of the word revolution the belligerent denunciation by the sick fanatic of ignorance who try to build a papier mache wall of pseudo patriotism on our physical horizon difficult a it may have be at time pozzatti and i saw enough talk to enough artist historian and others to realize that the issue be quite clear artist and poet be the raw nerve end of humanity they be small in number and their contribution be not immediately decisive in everyday life by themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would be very little leave worth save it can not be say that our very first day in the soviet union turn out to be an ordinary one on that cold but bright april day we be guest of your government in the review stand of red square to witness the poeple s celebration for yuri gagarin and late on that day we attend the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palace of the kremlin if we thus spend our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honor a new hero and a great national achievement our last day to u at least be equally impressive and very move even though the crowd be absent and there be almost complete silence we stand under a gigantic tree in the roll country just outside of moscow look at silent flower on the grave of a russian poet and writer who cherish the love for his country to the point of forego the high international honor the grave about half way between his home and the blue turret of a small church rise above the form and space of gently undisciplined pasture of green the sound of bird the silence of other graf and the casual path through small forest just yesterday we have meet and talk with a live writer a contemporary of the dead poet who be know for his ability of manipulate his idea and his craft more advantageously but today we be aware of only two men one have take a flight into uncharted space in the service of science to return a a live hero the other have assume the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit the flower on his grave attest to the fact that he a well be somebody s hero these two recollection form the frame around a series of experience and sight which to me at least symbolize the extreme in the aesthetic a well a ethical conflict between materialism and humanism a struggle that be be wag all over the world in the half light of disinterest the prevalent opinion which we encounter in a variety of expression in your country deny not only the existence of this conflict but it be elaborate even far with an incredible semantic dexterity the socialist environment it be state have cross fertilize these two extreme seed and be about to produce a new plant and fruit when i speculate on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutation might be unable to propagate i be immediately accuse of preaching racial prejudice i could not bring myself to answer that some of my best friend be non propagate mule this kind of reason and logic take a little time to get use to after a while we be perhaps less surprise but still puzzle when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and illogical comparison a chance remark about lenin s seal train bring the rejoinder that this be a myth akin to george washington s cherry tree theory of the behavior pattern of population mass be compare to scientific discovery concern the motion pattern of gaseous mass no wonder that pozzatti and i have at time difficulty in remember the real purpose of our presence namely cultural exchange typical of such an experience be the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the office of the union of soviet artist we have look forward to what we hop to be our first informal meet with a number of moscow s artist instead we become involve in a series of friendly but overly formal welcome address to which we have no choice but to reply in kind the term of friendship understand cooperation etc tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use i can only hope that the continue exchange of group and individual between our country will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion the preside female functionary of massive proportion and forbid appearance initially do not contribute to the expression of friendship and welcome by a number of dignify gentleman represent the art it be only after we have respond with what i fear be similar cliche that she go into action by question our desire for friendship and understand with a challenge about aggressive and warlike action by the u s government in cuba and lao she retreat by leave the room when we suggest that our meet might well terminate right then and there unfortunately she return late just a i have take advantage of the friendly atmosphere in the room by state that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange program would be the re emergence of abstract art in russia with social realism regain dominance in the u s this give her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on abstraction she do not go so far a to say a be do on other occasion that abstraction a well a impressionism be a russian invention that have be discard a unwanted by the people of the u s s r pozzatti and i could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere we be to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with u the impression that in contrast to other soviet region moscow s atmosphere be depressingly subdue and official to have one s intention deliberately or unintentionally misunderstand be always a waste of time until our moscow experience i have not consider it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally artist simply do not talk to each other in that fashion and furthermore i could not presume the implication that i speak for american artist a a group to save time some clarification seem necessary the follow be a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artist in leningrad we have come to your land with the express intention of understand and respect your idea and your way our presence here should also be consider far sincere evidence of the attempt by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible way to effect close peaceful tie among all people we be quite convince that one of the main hop for the future depend upon the informal contact and exchange of idea between individual in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experience among you we have already see many indication of your character and spirit we be acutely aware that yours be a society which in spite of several war and many privation have develop itself into one of the foremost nation of the world your past history be resplendent with the fruit of the intellect your present history be equally admirable for it industrial and scientific achievement we have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempt to acquaint you with that of ours while we a american artist believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves if we fail to state a specific attitude toward our own society a well a the international community a a whole in state this position we should like to make it clear to you that we can not expect artist and intellectual in other land to share our opinion in every respect a a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artist but certainly all will agree that it be not so much the knowledge and search for similarity between you and u but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our difference which may lead u to our respective and desire goal with a minimum of misunderstanding like yourselves we have pride and love for our country to many of u this be a land to which we or our parent flee from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignify freedom a artist we feel the same obligation a do other individual in consider ourselves responsible citizen of a great nation
cj63,cj63,informative,learned,2299,the sane society be an ambitious work it scope be a broad a the question what do it mean to live in modern society a work so broad even when it be direct by a lead idea and inform by a moral vision must necessarily fail even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spot error of fact and argument important exclusion area of ignorance and prejudice undue emphasis on trivia example of broad position support by flimsy evidence and the like such book be easy prey for critic nor need the critic be captious a careful and orderly man who value precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be put off by such a book it be a simple matter for one so dispose to take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and end the thing can be make to look like the clutter attic of a large and vigorous family a motley jumble of discard object some outwear and some that be never useful some once whole and bright but now chip and tarnish some odd piece whose history no one remember here and there a gem everything fascinate because it suggest some part of the human condition the whole add up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the maker and user that could be easily do but there be little reason in it it would come down to say that fromm paint with a broad brush and that after all be not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he have from the outset i mention these feature of the book because they be inherent in the book s character and therefore must be mention it would be superfluous to build a critique around them there be more substantial criticism to be make of fromm s account of capitalist civilization it be worthwhile to recall that fromm s treatment have both descriptive and normative aspect since i have already discuss his moral position that discussion be incorporate by reference into the follow page which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of fromm s treatment i shall first indicate a couple of weakness in fromm s analysis then argue that grant these weakness he still have much leave that be valuable and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation almost no empirical work have be do on the problem of alienation despite it rather long intellectual history alienation be still a promise hypothesis and not a verify theory the idea have receive much attention in philosophy in literature and in a few work of general social criticism such a the sane society what be miss be work that would answer presumably by the use of survey method and guttman type attitude scale such question a these what be the component of the feel state describe a alienation how widespread be alienation what be it incidence among the various class and subgroup of the population take alienation a a dependent variable with what socio structural factor be it most highly associate consider a an independent variable how do it affect behavior in various sector of life until such work be do there must remain the nag suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who reject by and in turn reject the large society project his own fear and despair onto the broad social screen i be not suggest that fromm ought to do this kind of work nor do i think that alienation be nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual i be say only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence come in any discussion of alienation must be understand to have certain important limitation until such evidence appear we must make do with the evidence we have here perhaps fromm be vulnerable for he do not always use the best and most recent evidence available and he sometimes select and interpret the evidence in rather special way three example follow fromm s analysis of alienation in the sphere of production center around the concept of the bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from control and the broad and thus from the point of view of corporate control ineffective dispersion of stock ownership for all these point he rely exclusively on berle and mean s study of the modern corporation and private property the broad conclusion of that pioneer work remain undisturbed but subsequent research have expand and somewhat alter their empirical support have suggest important revision in the general analytic frame of reference and have sharpen the mean of particular analytic concept in this area fromm seem unaware of these development another example be his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from survey design to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topic he cite such survey type find just three time moreover the conclusion he draw from the find be not always the only one possible for example he cite the follow data from two study on job satisfaction in the first study per cent of professional and executive per cent of white collar people and per cent of factory worker express satisfaction with their job in the second study the percentage be for professional for managerial person for commercial employee for skilled worker and for semi skilled worker he conclude that these data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously dissatisfy and unhappy person among factory and clerical worker start from other value premise than fromm s some analyst might conclude that the percentage really tell u very little at all while others might even conclude that the figure be remarkably low eric hoffer for example once say that america be a paradise the only one in the history of the world for workingman and small child what matter be that while fromm s read of the data be not the only one possible it be precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believe that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfy fromm also cite a poll on attitude toward work restriction conduct by the opinion research corporation in in which per cent of manual worker say a man ought to turn out a much a he could in a day s work while per cent say he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount fromm say these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment be widespread that be one way to read the find but again there be other way one might use such find to indicate the strength of informal primary association in the factory an interpretation which would run counter to fromm s theory of alienation or he might remind fromm that the per cent figure be really astonishingly low after all the medieval guild system be dedicate to the proposition that per cent of the worker ought to turn out only the average amount and today s trade union announce pretty much the same view in view of these shortcoming in both the amount and the interpretation of survey type find on public opinion and consider the criticism which can be bring against fromm s philosophical anthropology such a passage a the follow can not be take seriously be people happy be they a satisfy unconsciously a they believe themselves to be consider the nature of man and the condition for happiness this can hardly be so the ambiguity suggest above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm s style of think he seem to use the term alienation in two different way sometimes he us it a a subjective descriptive term and sometimes a an objective diagnostic one that be sometimes it be use to describe felt human misery and other time it be postulate to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent the failure to keep these two usage distinct present hazard to the reader it also permit fromm to do some dubious thing with empirical find when alienation be use a an objective and diagnostic category for example it become clear that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation go far toward conquer it he in effect do say this in his discussion of the pseudo happiness of the automaton conformist start from this and accept his estimate of the iniquity of modern society it would follow that the really disturb evidence of alienation would be that of a work satisfaction survey which report widespread state worker satisfaction rather than widespread state worker dissatisfaction the point be that in a system such a fromm s which recognize unconscious motivation and which rest on certain ethical absolute empirical data can be use to support whatever proposition the writer be urging at the moment thus in the example cite above fromm rest his whole case on the premise that the worker be be deprive unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then support this with survey data report conscious experience frustration he have his cake and eat it too if the worker say they be dissatisfy this show conscious alienation if they say they be satisfy this show unconscious alienation this sort of manipulation be especially troublesome in fromm s work because although his system be derive largely from certain philosophic conviction he assert that it be base on empirical find draw both from social science and from his own consult room while the empirical psychoanalytic label which fromm claim shed no light on the validity of his underlie philosophy it do increase the marketability of his product the final example of the failure to use available evidence though evidence of a different kind from that which have so far be consider come from fromm s treatment of some other writer who have deal with the same theme in a brief chapter deal with various other diagnose he quote isolate passage from some writer whose view seem to corroborate his own and find it most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth century society be already hold by a number of thinker live in the nineteenth he find it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves and with the critic of the twentieth century there be nothing remarkable about this at all it be largely a matter of find passage that suit one s purpose there be a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm s citation of the other diagnostician fit the latter category glance at the list burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a r heron huxley schweitzer and einstein this be a delightfully motley collection one can make them say the same thing only by not listen to them very carefully and hearing only what one want to hear the method of selection fromm us achieve exactly that furthermore the list be interest for it omission it omit for example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english social critic nearly all the great writer whose basic position be religious and all those who be with more or less accuracy call existentialist of course the list also exclude all writer who be fairly optimistic about the modern situation these almost by definition be spokesman for an alienate ideology it be not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm find so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion turn from these problem of the use of evidence one meet another type of difficulty in fromm s analysis which be his loose and ambiguous use of certain important term one such instance have already be present his use of alienation the only other one i shall mention here be his use of the term capitalism for fromm capitalism be the enemy the root of all evil it be of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one s social criticism for it make diagnosis and prescription much easy than they might otherwise be
cj64,cj64,informative,learned,2291,if one characteristic distinguish boris godunov it be the consistency with which every person on the stage include the chorus come alive in the music much of this lifelike quality result from mussorgsky s care in base his vocal line on natural speech inflection in this he follow a path that lead back to the very source of opera such composer a monteverdi lully and purcell with the same goal in mind have develop style of recitative sensitively attune to their own language through long experimentation in his song mussorgsky develop a russian recitative a different from others a the language itself give most of his musical continuity to the orchestra he let the speech fall into place a if by coincidence but control the pace and emphasis of the word the moment of sing melody in the usual sense come most often when the character be actually suppose to be sing a in folk song and liturgical chant otherwise mussorgsky reserve his vocal melody for prolong expression of emotion boris first monologue for example even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggest that the word come first in importance aside from boris himself one need but examine the secondary role to place mussorgsky among the master of musical portraiture even those who appear in only one or two scene be full personality define with economical precision consider the four monk who figure prominently in the action pimen varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni under no circumstance could we mistake one for the other each musical set have an individual touch pimen be an old man weak in body his voice rarely rise to a full forte but firm and clear of mind his calmness offer contrast to grigori s youthful excitement a quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appear whenever the old monk speak of the history he be record or of his own past life this theme come to represent the out world the realm of battle and banquet see from a distance quite distinct from the quiet spiritual life in the monastery it change and develop accord to the text it introduce pimen when he come before boris in the last act once he have be identify however a new melody be use to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren octave create a rather ancient effect an imaginative storyteller pimen take on the character he describe a if he be experience the old shepherd s blindness and miraculous cure here the composer us a favorite device of his the intensification of the mood through key relationship the original d minor seem to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempt to move away from it a the child address the shepherd in a dream light in the form of the major mode begin to appear and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shin d major varlaam and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguish them from the more subtle and well educate pimen their beg song might easily be a folk melody the same could be say for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene apparently their origin be humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated whatever learn they may have have in their order doesn t disturb them now missail be the straight man not very talkative mild mannered when he do speak varlaam be loud rowdy uninhibited in his pleasure and impatient with anyone who be not the same a rough ostinato figure hear first in the introduction to the inn scene characterize him amusingly and reappear whenever he come into the action the song of kazan in which this figure become a wild sound accompaniment fill in the picture of undisciplined high spirit the phrasing be irregular and the abrupt key change have a primitive forcefulness we can imagine how they startle audience of the s varlaam s music begin to ramble a he feel the effect of the wine but he pull himself together when the need arise both monk respond to the guard s challenge with a few phrase of their beg song a clever naturalistic touch be varlaam s labor read of the warrant a the knack gradually come back to him his rhythm become steady with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader for the only time in the opera word be not set accord to their natural inflection to do so would have spoil the dramatic point of the scene musically and dramatically rangoni be a far remove from the conventional monk a varlaam his music show a sensuality couple with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood kinship with dappertutto in offenbach s hoffman his speech show none of the native accent of the russian character in spite of the italian name he sound french his personality appear more strike by contrast with marina who be perhaps purposely rather superficially characterize rangoni s first entrance be a musical shock a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what have precede it the effect be a if he have materialize out of nowhere he speak quietly conceal his authority beneath a smooth humility just a the shift harmony that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them he address marina with great deference call her princess at first it be only after he have involve her emotion in his scheme that he us her give name place himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father curiously this scene be a close parallel to one that verdi be write at the same time the scene between amonasro and aida rangoni and amonasro have the same purpose force the girl to charm the man she love into serve her country s cause and their tactic be much the same rangoni begin by describe the sad state of the church this bring a reaction of distress from marina the music become ethereal a he call up a vision of her own sainthood it be she he tell her who can bring the truth to russia and convert the heretic a if in a trance she repeat his word then realize with a shock her own audacity this be no assignment for a frivolous girl she assure him now rangoni come to the point and we hear for the first time a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power it be a phrase a arrest a a magician s gesture with a piquant turn of harmony give an effect of strangeness another theme sinuously chromatic appear a he direct her to gain power over grigori by any mean even at the cost of her honor come from a priest the music sound a odd a the advice marina rebel at this suggestion her pride be a much at stake a her virtue she be the unattainable beauty the princess who turn away suitor by the dozen indignantly she denounce rangoni for his evil thought and order him to leave her at once the jesuit pull out all the stop to music of a menace darkness he describe the power of satan gain control of the girl poison her soul with pride and destroy her beauty the combine threat of hell fire and ugliness be too much for her and she fall terrify at his foot with another sudden change of mood he be again calm and protective exhort her to trust and obey him a god s spokesman and the chromatic scale descend in ominous contradiction whatever the source of rangoni s power marina be his captive now we be remind of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cut through the warmth of the love duet again throw a chill over the atmosphere the most unusual feature of boris however be the use of the greatest character of all the chorus this be the real protagonist of the drama the conflict be not boris versus grigori or shuiski or even the ghost of the murder child but boris versus the russian people mussorgsky make this quite clear by the extent to which choral scene propel the action boris first entrance seem almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene with it dazzle confusion of tonality we have a brief glimpse of the tsar s public personality the official boris but our real focus be on the excitement of the crowd a significant contrast with it halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene it bitter resentment and fury in the final act one reason for the unique vitality of the chorus be it great variety in expression it rarely speak a a unit even in it most conventional appearance the guest song of praise to marina there be a few female dissenter criticize the princess for her coldness in many passage for example the council of boyars each section of the chorus become a character group with a particular opinion hot argument arise between tenor and bass who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea the opening scene show this method at it most individual mussorgsky paint a tell picture of the common people those who must suffer the effect of their ruler struggle for power without understand the cause they be hold in control by force but barely they will kneel and plead for boris leadership in a strangely intense song it phrase irregularly break a if gasp for breath but when the police with their cudgel move away they mock and grumble and fight among themselves there be a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone hey mityukh ask one group what be we shout about and mityukh apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd reply that he have no notion the joke and argument grow loud until the police return then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before ending it with a wail of despair mussorgsky frequently us liturgical music with considerable dramatic force in pimen s cell the soft prayer of the monk hear from offstage not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori s thought and his situation this be especially strike between pimen s quiet exit and grigori s vehement outburst against boris again a boris feel himself near death a procession file into the hall sing a hymn it modal harmony add a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere the word be hardly calculate to put the tsar s mind at ease they echo the word with which he have describe his own vision of the die child who tremble and beg for mercy and there be no mercy the live a well a the dead now accuse him this final reminder of his guilt be the fatal one one of the outstanding asset of the present production be the restoration of the st basil s scene usually omit from performance and rarely include in a publish score though brief it have a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy in addition it be an important link in the plot give u a reveal glimpse of the people s attitude toward boris and the false dimitri the mayhem in the forest of kromy be a natural sequel the st basil s scene open with little group of beggar mill around the square the ever present police keep them under scrutiny in the orchestra we hear first a hush hesitant pizzicato figure then the insistent police motif a it appear in the opening scene the service be over and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman mityukh in the lead they bring the news that the pretender have be excommunicate this be meet with scorn by the hearer who claim that mityukh be lie or drink mussorgsky cleverly contrast the two group by their orchestral accompaniment solemn chord or mock staccatos there be still more news mityukh announce they have pray for the soul of the tsarevich
cj65,cj65,informative,learned,2386,so far these remark like most criticism of hardy have tacitly assume that his poetry be all of a piece one solid mass of verse express a sensibility at a single stage of development for critic hardy have have no poetic period one do not speak of early hardy or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply of hardy a of a poetic monolith this seem odd when one recall that he write poetry long than any other major english poet domicilium be date between and see the moon rise be date august one might expect that in a poetic career of seventy odd year some change in style and method would have occur some development take place this be not however the case and development be a term which we can apply to hardy only in a very limit sense in a time when poetic style and poetic belief a well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stand out a a poet of almost perverse consistency though he struggle with philosophy all his life he never get much beyond the pessimism of his twenty the sober opinion of his letter to noyes write when hardy be eighty year old be essentially that of his first philosophical notebook entry make when he be twenty five the world do not despise u it only neglect u early life p and though in his late year he revise his poem many time the revision do not alter the essential nature of the style which he have establish before he be thirty so that while it usually be easy to recognize a poem by hardy it be difficult to date one there be only one sense in which it be valid to talk about hardy s development he do develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize a uniquely his there be only one hardy style but in the early poem that style be only intermittently evident and when it be not the style be the style of another poet or of the fashion of the time in the late poem however the personal tone predominate the bad early poem be bad shakespeare or bad swinburne the bad late poem be bad hardy there be two way of get at a poet s development through his date poem and through the revision which he make in late edition of his work about a quarter of hardy s poem carry an append date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive year or two separate date when hardy work on the poem and or an approximate date during the war these date be virtually the only clue we have to the chronology of the poem since the separate volume be neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other with the exception of satire of circumstance each volume contain date poem range over several decade winter word span sixty one year the internal organization rarely have any chronological order except in obvious group like the poem of pilgrimage the poem of and the war poem from the date poem we can venture certain conclusion about hardy s career in poetry always remember that conclusion base on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative the date poem suggest that while hardy s concern with poetry may have be constant his production be not he have two productive period one in the late s the other in the decade from to half of the date poem be from the latter period and these alone total about one tenth of all hardy s poem there be one sterile period only one poem be date between and and except for the poem write on the trip to italy in very few from to the date poem also give u an idea of the degree to which hardy draw upon past production for his various volume and therefore probably be an indication of the amount of poetry he be write at the time poem of the past and the present and time s laugh stock both publish while hardy be at work on the dynast draw heavily on poem write before satire of circumstance and moment of vision come during his most productive decade be relatively self contain the former contain no poem date before that be no poem from a period cover by a previous volume and the latter have only a few such the last three volume be again more dependent on the past a hardy s creative power decline in his old age these observation about hardy s productivity tally with the detail of his life a we know them the first productive period come when he be consider poetry a a vocation before he have decide to write fiction for a live in his note for who s who he write that he write verse give up verse for prose but resume it late during the poetically sterile year he be write novel at the rate of almost one a year and be in addition burden with bad health he spend six month in bed in too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at a laodicean two entry in the early life support the assumption that during this period hardy have virtually suspend the write of poetry mr hardy record that at the end of november he make a note of an intention to resume poetry a soon a possible early life p and on christmas day hardy write while think of resume the viewless wing of poesy before dawn this morning new horizon seem to open and worry pettiness to disappear early life p there be more poem date in the s than in the s hardy have apparently resume the viewless wing a he decrease the volume of his fiction but none in the year of te and only one in the year of jude after the number increase and in the next thirty year there be only one year for which there be no date poem when hardy be at work on the dynast the second productive period the decade from to can be relate to three event the completion of the dynast in which leave hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty year the death of emma hardy in which have a profound emotional effect on hardy for which he find release in poetry and the first world war it may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventy but we have it on hardy s own authority that he be a child till he be sixteen a youth till he be five and twenty and a young man till he be nearly fifty early life p we may carry this sequence one step far and say that at seventy he be a poet at the height of his power want only the impetus of two tragedy one personal the other national to loose those power in poetry hardy s two productive decade be separate by forty year yet between them he develop only in that he become more steadily himself it be a narrow not an expand process like a wise gardener hardy prune away the shakespearian sonnet and song and the element of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style be not suit and let the main stock of his talent flourish the range of the late poetry be considerably narrow but the number of successful poem be far great we can see the general characteristic of the early decade if we look at two poem of very different quality revulsion and neutral tone there be not much to be say for revulsion like about half of the poem it be a sonnet on a conventional theme the unhappiness of love almost anyone could have write it it be competent in the sense that it make a coherent statement without violate the rule of the sonnet form but it be entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy the language be the conventional language of the form there be no phrase or image that sound like hardy or that be strike enough to give individuality to the poem it be smooth than hardy usually be but with the smoothness of anonymity it be obviously a young man s poem write out of book and not out of experience it assert emotion without evoke it that be to say it be sentimental there be many such competently anonymous performance among the early poem neutral tone we immediately recognize a a fine poem in hardy s most characteristic style the plain but not quite colloquial language the hard particular colorless image the slightly odd stanza form the dramatic handle of the occasion the refusal to resolve the issue all these we have see in hardy s best poem the poem do not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic source of diction yet it be obviously not ordinary speech only hardy would say a grin of bitterness sweep thereby like an ominous bird a wing or wring with wrong or would describe a winter sun a god curse the detail of the set of neutral tone be not strictly speak metaphorical but they combine to create a mood which be appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the emotion and the element symbolize each other in a way that be common to many of hardy s best poem weather the darkling thrush and during wind and rain for example and to some move passage in the novel a well far from the madding crowd be full of scene construct in this way neutral tone be an excellent example of hardy s mature style draw from his early productive period i cite it a evidence that he do not develop through new style a he grow old a yeats do but that he simply learn to use well what he already have in the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man s sense of the world if it be somber it be also precise and the precision lend authority to the vision in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism be a case not prove the poem offer nothing to persuade u of the speaker s right to speak a he do in the decade there be many poem like revulsion but there be only one neutral tone hardy be not hardy very often the poem of offer a good example of hardy s style a it be manifest in the late productive decade these be the poem hardy write after the death of his first wife they compose a painful elegy to what might have be to a marriage that begin with a promise of happiness and end in long year of suffer and hatred hardy obviously felt that these poem be peculiarly personal and private he sometimes call them an expiation and he would not allow them to be publish in periodical they be the only poem that he rearrange a a group between their first appearance in satire of circumstance and the publication of the collect poem the elegiac tone be hardy s natural tone of voice and it be not surprise that the poem be consistently and unmistakably his the view be always toward the past but the mood be not quite nostalgic hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead the poem be the epigraph tell u the trace of an ancient flame the fire of love be dead and hardy stand a the speaker do in the last poem of the sequence over the burn circle of char stick and think of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted
cj66,cj66,informative,learned,2313,critically invisible modern revolt like x ray and radioactivity be perceive only by it effect at more materialistic social level where it be call delinquency disaffiliation by the way be the term use by the critic and poet lawrence lipton who have write several article on this subject the first of which in the nation quote a epigraph we disaffiliate john l lewis like the pillar of hercules like two ruin titan guard the entrance to one of dante s circle stand two great dead juvenile delinquent the hero of the post war generation the great saxophonist charlie parker and dylan thomas if the word deliberate mean anything both of them certainly deliberately destroy themselves both of them be overcome by the horror of the world in which they find themselves because at last they could no long overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art both of them be my friend live in san francisco i saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which be not distort by exasperation or fatigue so a the year pass i saw them each time in the light of an accelerate personal conflagration the last time i saw bird at jimbo s bob city he be so go so blind to the world that he literally sit down on me before he realize i be there what happen man i say refer to the pretentious jazz concert evil man evil he say and that s all he say for the rest of the night about dawn he get up to blow the rowdy crowd chill into stillness and the fluent melody spiral through it the last time i saw dylan his self destruction have not just pass the limit of rationality it have assume the terrify inertia of inanimate matter be with him be like be sweep away by a torrent of fall stone now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end a artist they be very similar they be both very fluent but this fluent enchant utterance have compare with important artist of the past relatively little content neither of them get very far beyond a sort of entrance rapture at his own creativity the principal theme of thomas s poetry be the ambivalence of birth and death the pain of blood stain creation music of course be not so explicit an art but anybody who know charlie parker know that he felt much the same way about his own gift both of them do communicate one central theme against the ruin of the world there be only one defense the creative act this of course be the theme of much art perhaps most poetry it be the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bear little resemblance to parker or thomas the difference be that horace accept his theme with a kind of silken assurance to dylan and bird it be an agony and terror i do not believe that this be due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity i believe rather that it be due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seem to be the sole value horace s column of imperishable verse shin quietly enough in the lucid air of augustan rome art may have be for him the most endure orderly and noble activity of man but the other activity of his life partake of these value they do not actively negate them dylan thomas s verse have to find endurance in a world of burn city and burn jew he be able to find mean in his art a long a it be the answer to air raid and gas oven a the world begin to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven i believe his art become meaningless to him i think all this could apply to parker just a well although because of the nature of music it be not demonstrable at least not conclusively thomas and parker have more in common than theme attitude life pattern in the practice of their art there be an obvious technical resemblance contrary to popular belief they be not great technical innovator their effect be only superficially startle thomas be a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writer like pierre reverdy or apollinaire similarly the innovation of bop and of parker particularly have be vastly overrate by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado the tonal novelty consist in the introduction of a few chord use in classical music for century and there be less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there be between two movement of many conventional symphony what parker and his contemporary gillespie davis monk roach tristano be an anomaly etc do be to absorb the musical ornamentation of the old jazz into the basic structure of which it then become an integral part and with which it then develop this be true of the melodic line which could be put together from select passage of almost anybody benny carter johnny hodges it be true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shift continuously or at least be continuously spring so that it become ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominate by the long pulsation of the phrase or strophe this be exactly what happen in the transition from baroque to rococo music it be the difference between bach and mozart it be not a farfetched analogy to say that this be what thomas do to poetry the special syntactical effect of a rimbaud or an edith sitwell actually ornament become the main concern the metaphysical conceit which fascinate the reactionary generation still dominant in backwater american college be embroidery thomas s ellipsis and ambiguity be end in themselves the immediate theme if it exist be incidental and his main theme the terror of birth be simply reiterate this be one difference between bird and dylan which should be point out again contrary to popular belief there be nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically or emotionally his sinuous melody be a sort of naive transcendence of all experience emotionally it do not resemble berlioz or wagner it resemble mozart this be true also of a painter like jackson pollock he may have be eccentric in his behavior but his painting be a impassive a persian tile partly this difference be due to the nature of verbal communication the insistent talk aboutiveness of the general environment obtrude into even the most idyllic poetry it be much more a personal difference thomas certainly want to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world parker and pollock want to substitute a work of art for the world technique pure and simple rendition be not of major importance but it be interest that parker follow lester young be one of the leader of the so call saxophone revolution in modern jazz the saxophone be treat a a woodwind and play with conventional embouchure metrically thomas s verse be extremely conventional a be incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart crane i want to make clear what i consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post war art ornament be confabulation in the interstice of structure a poem by dylan thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson pollock these be pure confabulation a end in themselves confabulation have come to determine structure uninhibited lyricism should be distinguish from it exact opposite the sterile extraneous invention of the corn belt metaphysicals or present blight of poetic professor just a hart crane have little influence on anyone except very reactionary writer like allen tate for instance to whom valery be the last word in modern poetry and the felicity of an apollinaire let alone a paul eluard be nonsense so dylan thomas s influence have be slight indeed in fact his only disciple the only person to imitate his style be w s graham who seem to have imitate him without much understand and who have since move on to other method thomas s principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude that of the now extinct british romantic school of the new apocalypse henry treece j f hendry and others all of whom be quite conventional poet parker certainly have much more of an influence at one time it be the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in america to blow like bird even before his death this influence have begin to ebb in fact the whole generation of the found father of bop gillespie monk davis blakey and the rest be just now at a considerable discount the main line of development today go back to lester young and by pass them the point be that many of the most impressive development in the art nowadays be aberrant idiosyncratic there be no long any sense of continue development of the sort that can be trace from baudelaire to eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry james to gertrude stein the cubist generation before world war and on a lower level the surrealist of the period between the war both assume an accept universe of discourse in which to quote andre breton it be possible to make definite advance exactly a in the science i doubt if anyone hold such idea today continuity exit but like the neo swing music develop from lester young it be a continuity sustain by popular demand in the plastic art a very similar situation exist surrealist like han arp and max ernst might talk of creation by hazard of compose picture by walk on them with paint sol or by toss bit of paper up in the air but it be obvious that they be self delude nothing look anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp nothing look less like their work than the happen of random occasion many of the post world war abstract expressionist apostle of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do look like accident the aesthetic appeal of pure paint lay on at random may exist but it be a very impoverish appeal once again what have happen be an all consume confabulation of the incidental the accident of painting it be curious that at it best the work of this school of painting mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still robert motherwell willem de kooning and the rest resemble nothing so much a the passage painting of quite unimpressive painter the mother of pearl shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee itself a formula derive from renoir the splash of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitator of hals and sargent often work of this sort be present a calligraphy the pure utterance of the brush stroke seek only absolute painteresque value you have only to compare such painting with the work of say sesshu to realize that someone be use word and brush carelessly at it best the abstract expressionist achieve a simple rococo decorative surface it poverty show up immediately when compare with tiepolo where the rococo rise to painting of extraordinary profundity and power a tiepolo painting however confabulate be a universe of tension in vast depth a pollock be an object of art bijouterie disguise only by it great size in fact once the size be big enough to cover a whole wall it turn into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper now there be nothing wrong with complicate wallpaper there be just more to tiepolo the great ashikaga brush painter paint wallpaper too at least portable one screen a process of elimination which leave the artist with nothing but the play of his material themselves can not sustain interest in either artist or public for very long so in the last couple of year abstract expressionism have tend toward romantic suggestion indication of landscape or live figure
cj67,cj67,informative,learned,2210,anglo saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasion a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age hrothgar s court bard sing of the encounter at finnsburg line and improvise the tale of beowulf s exploit in a complimentary comparison of the geatish visitor with sigemund line alcinous court bard sing of the discover adultery of are and aphrodite odyssey and take up a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listen on odyssey nothing in all this be autobiographical unlike the poet of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf be not concern with his own identity the poet of the odyssey repute blind reveal himself not at all in sing of the blind minstrel demodocus since none of these glimpse of poetize without write be intend to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there be prima facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poem each derive from an oral tradition that such a tradition lie behind the iliad and the odyssey at least be hard to deny milman parry rigorously defend the observation that the extant homeric poem be largely formulaic and be lead to postulate that they could be show entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survive he far reason that frequent formula in epic verse indicate oral composition and assume the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic be incline towards the use of formula proceed from parry s conclusion and adopt one of his schema francis p magoun jr argue that beowulf likewise be create from a legacy of oral formula inherit and extend by bard of successive generation and the thesis be strike and compel yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment beowulf and the homeric poem be not at all formulaic to the same extent the bondage endurable by an oral poet be to be estimate only by a very skilful oral poet but it appear safe to assume that no sustain narrative in rhyme could be compose without extreme difficulty even in a language of many terminal inflection assonance seem nearly a severe a curb although in a celebrate passage william of malmesbury declare that a song of roland be intone before the battle commence at hastings the anglo saxon alliterative line and the homeric hexameter probably impose less of a restraint the verse of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey be not easy to create but be not impossible for poet who have develop their talent perforce in earn a livelihood yet certain aid be valuable and quite credibly necessary for recite long stretch of verse without a pause the poet in a write tradition who generally never blot a line may once in a while pause and polish without incur blame but the oral poet can not pause he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort even though the bondage of his verse be not so great a the write poet can manage it be still great enough for him often to be seriously impede unless he have aid to facilitate rapid composition the germanic poet have such aid in the kenning which provide for the difficulty of alliteration the homeric poet have epithet which provide for recur need in the hexameter either poet could quickly and easily select word or phrase to supply his immediate requirement a he chant out his line because the kenning and the epithet make possible the construction of system of numerous synonym for the chief common and proper noun other synonym could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i shall speak of kenning and epithet in the wide and loose possible sense and name for example gar dene a kenning for the dane verbal and adverbial element too participate in each epic diction but it be for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near equivalent and to designate the member of any system of equivalent a basic formula of the poetic language limit to a few thousand line of heroic verse in anglo saxon a in the other germanic dialect we can not say how frequently the kenning in beowulf recur in contemporary epic on the same soil but we can say that since a write poet with leisure before him would seem unlikely to invent a technique base upon frequent and substantial circumlocution the kenning like the epithet must reasonably be ascribe to an oral tradition one of the greatest homerists of our time frederick m combellack argue that when it be assume the iliad and the odyssey be oral poem the postulate single redactor call homer can not be either credit with or deny originality in choice of phrasing any example of grand or exquisite diction may have be create by the poet who compile numerous lay into the two work we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow craftsman the quest of the historical homer be likely never to have far success no individual word in the iliad or the odyssey can be credit to any one man no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poem can with assurance be say not to have be a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have exist at the begin of the first millennium before christ this observation be of interest not only to student of homeric poetry but to student of anglo saxon poetry a well to the extent that a tale be twice tell it final author must be suspect although plagiarism in an oral tradition be less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi combellack argue far and here he make his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey be think formulaic poem compose for an audience accustom to formulaic poetry homeric critic be deprive of an entire domain they previously find arable with a few important and a few more unimportant exception no expression can be deem le mot juste for it context because each be very probably the only expression that long establish practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow word or phrase that connoisseur have admire a handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regard a mere inevitable time server sometimes accurate and sometimes not this observation too may have reference to anglo saxon poetry to the extent that a language be formulaic it individual component must be regard a no more distinguish than other cliche w f bryan suggest that certain kenning in beowulf be select sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but such a view would appear untenable unless it be deny that the language of beowulf be formulaic if the master of scops who be most responsible for the poem ever use kenning that be traditional he be at least partly deprive of free will and not incline towards shrewd and sophisticate misuse of speech element once many significant phrase be find in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity they be not to be defend for their semantic property in isolate context it be false to be certain of have discover in the language of beowulf such effect a intentional irony yet if the argument be turn awry there may be find a great deal in bryan s view after all a formulaic element need not be hold meaningless merely because it be select with little conscious reflection time server though the periphrastic expression be they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous a long evolution in an oral tradition cause the poetic language of the heroic age to be base upon formula that show the important quality of thing and these formula be therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate true we do not know how they be regard in their day but we need not believe the epic audience to have be more insensitive to the formula than the numerous scholar of modern time who have read germanic or homeric poetry all their life and still find much to admire in occasional occurrence of the most familiar phrase noun and adjective in a write tradition be chosen for the nonce in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation reliance be therefore not to be place upon the archaeological particular in an oral poem no one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruin of heorot or the palace of priam a ship at dry dock could be call a foamy neck floater in anglo saxon or a swift ship in greek even when defenseless of weapon the dane would be gar dene a their king be hrothgar and priam would be eummelihs achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied be potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly be call swift foot even when he stand idle in coriolanus the agnomen of marcius be use deliberately and pointedly but the homeric epithet and the anglo saxon kenning be use casually and recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent the epic language be not entirely the servant of the poet it be partly his master the poet s intention be difficult to discern and except to biographer unimportant the language however be a proper object of scrutiny and the effect of the language be palpable even if sometimes inevitable beowulf and the homeric poem appear oral composition yet they be write at some stage in their evolution they be transcribe albert b lord suggest that the homeric poem be dictate to a scribe by a minstrel who hold in his mind the poem fully mature but do not himself possess the knowledge of write since it would be useless to his guild and magoun argue that the beowulf poet and cynewulf may have dictate their verse in the same fashion this explanation be attractive but be vitiate at least in part by the observation that cynewulf though he use kenning in the traditional manner be a literate man who four time inscribe his name by run into his work if cynewulf be literate the beowulf poet may have be also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and the odyssey in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard one may conceive of a man who hear a vast store of oral poetry recite and become intimately familiar with the establish aid to poetize and himself write his own composition or his edition of the composition of the past other theory of origin be compatible with the formulaic theory beowulf may contain a design for terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron proteron pattern answer to a ceramic pattern produce during the geometric period in pottery the account of the growth and final transcription of these epic rest partly however upon the degree to which they be formulaic carl eduard schmidt count different line repeat exactly in the two homeric poem and by increase this figure so a to include line repeat with very slight modification he count different line use a total of time thus one line in five from the iliad and the odyssey be to be find somewhere else in the two poem the ratio be thoroughly remarkable because the line be so long half again a long a those of beowulf anglo saxon poetry appear to have no comparable amount of repetition there be no reason to think that the scop use and re use whole line and even lengthy passage after the manner of his homeric colleague in determine the extent to which any poem be formulaic it be idle however to inspect nothing besides line repeat in their entirety for a stock of line fragment would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provide for prosodic need the close scrutiny be owe to the anglo saxon kenning and the homeric epithet if any word or phrase be formulaic they will be the iliad have two word for the shield aspis and sakos
cj68,cj68,informative,learned,2302,recent criticism of great expectation have tend to emphasize it symbolic and mythic content to show a m d zabel have say of dickens generally that much of the novel s impact reside in it allegoric insight and moral metaphor j h miller s excellent chapter on great expectation have lately illustrate how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective in his analysis however he touch upon but fail to explore an idea generally neglect in discussion of the book which i believe be central to it art the importance of human hand a a recur feature of the narrative this essay seek to make that exploration dickens be not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian writer he know instinctively that next to voice and face an actor s hand be his most useful possession that in fiction a in the theatre gesture be an indispensable shorthand for individualize character and dramatize action and response it be hardly accidental therefore that many of his most vivid figure do suggestive or eccentric thing with their hand in great expectation the hand become almost an obsession mr jagger habitually bite his forefinger a gesture which convey both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinate half terrify all who have deal with him miss havisham s wither hand heavy a if her unhappiness be somehow concentrate in them move in restless self pity between her break heart and her walk stick pumblechook s signature be the perpetually extend glad hand wemmick reveal his self satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hand together old mr pocket s frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social climb wife be to put his two hand into his disturb hair and make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas joe gargery endure the shrewish onslaught of mr joe by apologetically draw the back of his hand across and across his nose such mannerism would be less worthy of remark be it not that in great expectation a in no other of dickens novel hand serve a a leitmotif of plot and theme a kind of unify symbol or natural metaphor for the book s complex of human interrelationship and the value and attitude that motivate them dickens not only reveal character through gesture he make hand a crucial element of the plot a mean of clarify the structure of the novel by help to define the hero s relation with all the major character and a device for order such diverse theme a guilt pursuit crime greed education materialism enslavement by both people and institution friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman murderer in thomas burke s famous story the hand of mr ottermole to realize that hand often call up idea of crime and punishment so it be with great expectation whether the hand be orlick s a he strike down mr gargery or pip s a he steal a pie from her pantry such association suit well with the gothic or mystery story aspect of dickens novel but on a deep plane they relate to the theme of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently be analyze by other critic the novel open with a fugitive convict frantically try to avoid the nemesis of be lay hand on a mysterious figure who look into pip s frighten eye in the churchyard a if he be elude the hand of the dead people stretch up cautiously out of their graf to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in magwitch terrify pip into steal a pork pie for him by create the image in the boy s imagination of a bogy man who may softly creep his way to him and tear him open imbrue his hand in him a pip agonize over the theft that his own hand have commit his guilty conscience project itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transform it into a phantom devote me to the hulk hold upside down in the graveyard pip cling in terror with both hand to his convict late he flee in panic from the family table just a his theft be about to be discover and be block at the front door by a soldier who accusingly hold out a pair of handcuff which he have bring to gargery s forge for mending through such detail dickens indicate at the outset that guilt be a part of the ironic bond between pip and magwitch which be so unpredictably to alter both their life since they commonly translate thought and feel into deed hand naturally represent action and since nearly half the character in great expectation be of the underworld or closely allied to it the link of hand with crime or violence be not to be wonder at dickens for excellent psychological reason never fully reveal magwitch s felonious past but pip at the convict s climactic reappearance in london shrink from clasp a hand which he fear might be stain with blood orlick slouch about the forge like cain with his hand in his pocket and when he shout abuse at mr joe for object to his holiday she clap her hand in a tantrum beat them upon her bosom and upon her knee and clench them in her husband s hair this last rampage be only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head deal by some unknown hand whose identity be late reveal not verbally but through a manual action the trace of orlick s hammer upon a slate pip himself be to feel the terror of orlick s murderous hand in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marsh dickens lay great emphasis on the hand in this scene orlick shake his hand at pip bang the table with his fist draw his unclenched hand across his mouth a if his mouth water for his victim let his hand hang loose and heavy at his side and pip observe him so intensely that he know of the slight action of his finger orlick might almost be magwitch s bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from pip s phantasy of guilt the scar disfigure wrist of mr jagger housekeeper be the tell tale mark of her sinister past for her master coolly exhibit them to his dinner guest make a point of the force of grip there be in these hand jagger iron control over her she would remove her hand from any dish she put before him hesitatingly a if she dread his call her back rest on his have once get her acquit of a murder charge by cleverly contrive her sleeve at the trial to conceal her strength and by pass off the laceration on the back of her hand a the scratch of bramble rather than of human fingernail it be the similarity between estella s hand and molly s the action of her finger be like the action of knit that provide pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establish a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of satis house finally magwitch s pursuit of compeyson his archenemy and betrayer begin by his hold him in a vicelike grip on the river flat to frustrate his escape and culminate in his lay his hand on his cloak to identify him thus precipitate the death lock struggle in the water during which compeyson drown magwitch s hand here ironically become the agent of justice but only in one of it aspect be great expectation a tale of violence revenge and retribution money so important a theme elsewhere in dickens be here central and hand be often associate in some way with the false value acquisitiveness snobbery self interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice that attach to a society base upon the pursuit of wealth dickens suggest the economic evil of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of pip s five little dead brother who give up try to get a live exceedingly early in that universal struggle who seem to have all be bear on their back with their hand in their trouser pocket and have never take them out in this state of existence pip s great expectation his progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat a they do for the naive hero of dreiser s american tragedy upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income what wemmick call portable property and what jagger reproach pip for let slip through his finger since a gentleman must if possible avoid sully them by work his hand a importantly a his accent become the index of social status almost the first step in the corruption of pip s value be the unworthy shame he feel when estella cruelly remark the coarseness of his hand they have never trouble me before but they trouble me now a vulgar appendage pip imago how estella would look down upon joe s hand roughen by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast between her white hand and his blacken one be make to symbolize the opposition of value between which pip struggle idleness and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness and affection in fact between satis house and the forge when the snobbery that alienate pip from joe finally give way before the deep and strong force of love the reunion be mark by an embarrass handshake at which pip exclaim no don t wipe it off for god s sake give me your blacken hand pip s abject leave take of miss havisham during which he kneel to kiss her hand signalize his homage to a suppose patroness who seem to be opening up for him a new world of glamour when on the journey to london that immediately follow he pause nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger post at the end of the village the wooden pointer symbolically designate a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity incidentally one can not miss the significance of this gesture for dickens reintroduce it associatively in pip s mind at another moral and psychological crisis his painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that his hopeless attachment to estella be a self destructive a it be romantic in both case the finger post represent pip s heighten awareness of contrary magnetism a variety of hand movement help dramatize the moral climate of the fall world pip encounter beyond the forge the vulture like attendance of the pocket family upon miss havisham be sum up in the hypocritical gesture of miss camilla pocket who put her hand to her throat in a feign spasm of grief stricken choke then lay it upon her heave bosom with an unnatural fortitude of manner and finally kiss it to miss havisham in a parody of the lady s own mannerism toward estella pumblechook s hand throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self aggrandizement we first see him shake mr joe s hand on discover the sizable amount of the premium pay to her husband for pip s indenture a an apprentice and late pump pip s hand for the hundredth time at least may i may i in effusive congratulation to pip on his expectation we take leave of pumblechook a he gloat over pip s loss of fortune extend his hand with a magnificently forgive air and exhibit the same fat five finger one of which he identify with the finger of providence and shake at pip in a cant imputation of the latter s ingratitoode and his own generosity a pip s early benefactor pip first learn the stupendous power of money from the sycophantic tailor mr trabb whose brutality to his boy helper exactly match the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawn hand touch the outside of each elbow and rub pip out of the shop

from excessive loading have create the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristic of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume research at fayette missouri on oxidation pond have show that the bod in the treat effluent vary from to mg l with loading from to lb since experience indicate that effluent from oxidation pond do not create major problem at these bod concentration the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerate treatment system be the same a from conventional oxidation pond recent study by weston and stack have indicate that a turbine aerator could be add to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer their study show that it be possible to transfer to lb of oxygen hr hp o connor and eckenfelder discuss the use of aerate lagoon for treat organic waste they indicate that a day retention aerate lagoon would give to per cent bod reduction late eckenfelder increase the efficiency of treatment to between and per cent in the summer month it appear from the limit information available that the aerate lagoon might offer a satisfactory mean of increase the capacity of exist oxidation pond a well a provide the same degree of treatment in a small volume red bridge subdivision with the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansa city missouri the developer be face with the problem of provide adequate sewage disposal the sewage system from kansa city be not expect to serve the red bridge area for several year this necessitate the construction of temporary sewage treatment facility with an expect life from to aj for the initial development an oxidation pond be construct a show in figure the oxidation pond have a surface area of acre and a depth of aj the pond be currently serve person or person per acre in the summer of the oxidation pond become completely septic and emit obnoxious odor it be possible to maintain aerobic condition in the pond by regular addition of sodium nitrate until the temperature decrease and the algae population change from blue green to green algae the anaerobic condition in the exist oxidation pond necessitate examination of other method for supply additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate at the same time far expansion in the red bridge subdivision require the construction of additional sewage treatment facility the large land area require for oxidation pond make this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer it be propose that aerate lagoon be use to eliminate the problem at the exist oxidation pond and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development pilot lagoon the lack of adequate data on the aerate lagoon system prompt the developer to construct an aerate lagoon pilot plant to determine it feasibility for treat domestic sewage the pilot plant be a circular lagoon ft in diam at the surface and ft in diam at the bottom ft below the surface with a volume of aj the side slop be coat with fiberglas matting coat with asphalt to prevent erosion the pilot lagoon be locate a show in figure to serve the area just south of the exist housing area the major contributor be a shop center with house be add to the system a the subdivision develop the pilot lagoon be design to handle the waste from person with a day aeration period initially the wastewater would be entirely from the shop center with the domestic sewage from the house increase over an month period this operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly increase load over a reasonable period of time the pilot plant be equip with a hp turbine aerator figure the aerator have a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speed the sewage flow into the treatment plant be meter and continuously record on hr chart the raw sewage be introduce directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mix of the raw sewage with the aeration tank content the effluent be collect through two pip and discharge to the blue river through a surface drainage ditch analysis composite sample be collect at weekly interval the long retention period and the complete mix concept prevent rapid change in either the mix liquor or in the effluent weekly sample would make any change more readily discernible than daily sample the composite sample be normally collect over a hr period but an occasional hr composite be make examination of the operation of the shop center permit correlation of the hr composite sample with hr operation the data indicate that the organic load during the hr composite be essentially per cent of the hr organic load grab sample be collect from the exist oxidation pond to determine it operate condition effort be make to take the grab sample at random period so that the mass of data could be treat a a hr composite sample a single hr composite sample indicate that the sewage flow pattern and characteristic be typical pilot plant operation the bod of the influent to the pilot plant vary between and mg l with an average of aj this be equivalent to mg lbod on a hr basis the bod of the raw sewage be typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision the bod in the effluent average mg l a per cent reduction over the hr period examination of the data in table show that a few sample contribute to raise the effluent aj the period of high effluent bod occur during cold period when operational problem with the aerator result ice cause the aerator to overload strain the drive belt the slippage of the drive belt cause the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer a well a the mix of the raw sewage the organic loading on the unit average lb of bod day or about lb bod day cu ft aeration capacity needle to say the organic load be very low on a volumetric basis but be lb bod day acre on a surface loading basis it seem that the aerate lagoon be a very heavily load oxidation pond or a lightly load activate sludge system the flow rate remain relatively constant during the winter month a show in table with the spring rain the flow rise rapidly due to infiltration in open sewer a construction progress the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduce the retention period in the aerate lagoon range from to day average day the large amount of vegetable grind from the grocery store in the shop center create a suspend solid problem the vegetable be not readily metabolize by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tend to float on the surface a skim device at the effluent weir prevent loss of most of these light solid the average volatile suspend solid in the effluent be mg l while mls average mg l volatile suspend solid the average sludge age base on displacement of solid be calculate to be day the oxygen uptake rate in the mix liquor average mg l hr during the first four month of this study variation in aerator speed during the latter two month of this study cause increase mix and increase oxygen demand the increase in oxygen uptake rat from to mg l hr which follow an increase in rotor speed be believe to be relate to resuspension of solid which have settle at the lower rotor speed it appear that most of the mix liquor suspend solid be active microbial solid with the heavy less active solid settle out the suspend solid discharge in the effluent be find to be the major source of the aj removal of the suspend solid by a membrane filter yield an average effluent contain only mg l aj the bod in the drainage ditch receive the pilot plant effluent average aj this low bod be due to removal of the excess suspend solid by sedimentation since the only dilution be surface runoff which be very low during this study microscopic examination routine microscopic examination be make of the mix liquor a indicate by mckinney and gram for the various type of protozoa it be find that the aerate lagoon be an activate sludge system rather than an oxidation pond at no time be algae find in the mix liquor the bacteria form typical activate sludge floc the floc particle be all small a the heavy floc settle out initially the flagellate protozoa predominate but they soon give way to the free swim ciliated protozoa a the temperature decrease the number of free swim ciliated protozoa decrease very little protozoa activity exist below degree f when the temperature reach degree f all protozoan activity cease but a the temperature rise the number of protozoa increase rapidly only once be stalk ciliate find in the mix liquor the predomination of free swim ciliated protozoa be indicative of a high bacterial population oxygen transfer one of the important aspect of this study be to determine the oxygen transfer relationship of the mechanical aerator routine determination be make for dissolve oxygen in the mix liquor and for oxygen uptake rat the data give in table show the routine operation of the aerator the dissolve oxygen in the aeration unit be consistently high until january an extend cold spell cause ice to build up on the aerator which be mount on a float platform and cause the entire platform to sink lower in the water the add resistance to the rotor damage the drive belt and reduce the oxygen transfer capacity it be approximately one month before the belt problem be notice and correct but at no time be there a deficiency of dissolve oxygen a series of eight special test be conduct at different rotor speed to determine the oxygen transfer rate five of the test be conduct with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover the rate of oxygen transfer at mg l dissolve oxygen

cj71,cj71,informative,learned,2296,thus the three main category of antisubmarine warfare operation be defense of ship defense of naval force and area defense the last category overlap the others in amphibious operation and near terminal and base to effect these operation five element exist surface air mine submarine and fix installation surface force have be use to provide defense zone around naval and merchant ship formation air to furnish area surveillance and mine for protection of limit area submarine and shore installation be new element the submarine now have a definite place in submarine defense particularly in deny enemy access to ocean area fix installation offer possibility for area detection mine warfare be be reorient against submarine target a sixth element not always consider be intelligence it include operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment operational intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agency intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augment program in oceanography the major postwar development be the certainty that these element should not be consider singly but in combination and a be mutually support necessity for an over all concept think on submarine defense have not always be clear cut proponent of single element tend to ensure predominance of that element without determine if it be justify and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponent have assume the greatest importance consequently air surface and submarine element overshadow the mine fix installation and intelligence these have seek more and more of what they have each seem to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others this despite postwar experience demonstrate that all element be necessarily mutually support thus the most productive area be not necessarily the most stress this be state to emphasize the necessity for an over all concept of submarine defense one which would provide position of relative importance to asw element base on project potentiality then the enthusiasm and energy of all element can be channel to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective an over all concept would have other advantage it would allow presentation to the public of a unify approach now the problem be present piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily while one element be announce progress another be delineate it problem the result can only be confusion in the public mind a unify concept can serve a a guide to budget and if public support be gain will command congressional support industry s main criticism of the navy s antisubmarine effort be that it can not determine where any one company or industry can apply it skill and know how lack guidance industry pick it own area the result couple with the salesmanship for which american industry be famous be considerable expenditure of fund and effort in marginal area an over all concept will guide industry where available talent and facility will yield greatest dividend therefore a broad concept of over all submarine defense be need for co ordination of the navy s effort for a logical presentation to the public for industry s guidance and a a basis for a program to the congress principle involve in an over all concept that which follow will be a discussion of principle and possible content for an over all concept of antisubmarine warfare russia possess the preponderance of submarine in the world divide between her various fleet some be also in albania and others be on loan to egypt other country which may willingly or unwillingly become communist can furnish base communist target area can be assume but there be no certainty that such assumption coincide with soviet intention attack can come from almost any direction against many location logically then the first principle of the plan must be that it be not rigidly orient toward any geographical area it be often state that the submarine can be destroy while build at base in transit and on station destruction of the enemy s build and base complex however require attack on enemy territory which be possible only in event of all out hostility in transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarine until commission of an overt act the communist be adept at utilize hostility short of general war and will do so whenever it be to their advantage therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while provide for all out hostility it effectiveness be not dependent on general war antisubmarine warfare do not involve clash between large oppose force with the decision a result of a single battle it be a war of attrition of single action of an exchange of loss this exchange must result in our ending up with some effective unit initially have few unit of some element especially submarine than the opponent our capability need to be sufficiently great than theirs so that the exchange will be in our favor therefore the third principle of the plan must be that it do not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same type unless at an assure favorable exchange rate the submarine have increase it effectiveness by several order of magnitude since world war it speed have increase it operate at increasingly great depth it submerge endurance be become unlimited and it will become even more silent the next development will probably be in weaponry the missile can gradually be expect to replace the torpedo a detection range increase weapon will be develop to attack other submarine and surface craft at these range therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increase capability in the opponent no element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense some element support the others but all have limitation some limitation of one element can be compensate for by a capability of another element use in combination will increase the over all capability more than the sum of the capability of the individual element therefore the plan s fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capability of all element in combination conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solve by sufficient force number would be astronomical and current fiscal policy make this an impractical solution shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon program indicate that there will not be enough of anything therefore any measure take in peacetime which will decrease force requirement in war will contribute greatly to success when hostility occur therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measure which will reduce future force requirement the world be constantly change what be new yesterday be obsolescent today the seventh principle of the plan be self evident it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthrough scientific progress and change in world condition support element in asw operation to this point the need for an over all plan for submarine defense have be demonstrate the mission have be state broad principle delineate it content lay down and the support element list before consider these element in more detail an additional requirement should be state large area coverage will accomplish all other task therefore because reduction in task result in reduction of force require the plan should provide for expand area coverage but it must be remember that the plan should not be orient geographically consequently the system give area coverage if such coverage be less than world wide must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile since effective area coverage appear fairly remote the requirement can be bear in mind while consider the element air surface sub surface fix installation mine and intelligence these be arrange approximately in the order of the vociferousness of their proponent but will be discuss in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result intelligence a use herein will include information on possible opponent and on the environment which can affect operation these can be refer to a operational intelligence and environmental intelligence in submarine defense these must have maximum stress good operational intelligence can ensure sound plan greatly reduce force requirement and increase tactical effectiveness environmental intelligence be just a important the ocean presently co operate with the target full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side result in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactic a decrease in enemy capability and the development of method of capitalize on the environment therefore improve intelligence will result in reduce force requirement and a it support all other element rat a top priority gather intelligence be important but of equal importance be it translation into usable form a program be need to translate the result of oceanographic research into tactical and operate instruction approach this problem on a statistical basis be invalid because the opponent have the same source available and will be encounter not under average condition but under the condition most advantageous to him therefore the on the scene commander must have detail operate instruction base on measurement of condition in the area at the time of encounter all capability must be use to maximum advantage then temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and animal life be the chief environmental variable there may be others variation in sound velocity should be measure rather than temperature because more of the variable would be encompass these variation must eventually be measure horizontally a well a vertically progress in predict water condition be encourage but little guidance be available to the man at sea on the use of such information a concurrent effort be need to make oceanographic data useful on the spot mine warfare have in the past be direct against surface target by it nature it have always be of great psychological advantage and small effort have require considerably great counter effort mine be be increasingly orient against submarine target they be still consider to be for use in restrict water however and target must come within a few yard of them mine need to be recognize a a major element in anti submarine warfare employment extend to deep water and have their effective area per unit increase mine can be use to deny access to great area they be difficult to counter cost little to maintain until require and can be put into place quickly a most attractive feature be that detection and attack be combine in a single package effective employment will reduce force requirement for example effective mine barrier from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from cuba to mexico would remove all requirement for harbor defense inshore patrol convoy escort ship control and mine defense for the entire gulf of mexico more extend system cover all passage into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico from the previously list requirement system cover the gulf of st lawrence and possibly the entire coast of the unite state be not impossible such mine defense system could permit concentration of mobile force in the open ocean with consequent increase in the probability of success the advantage inherent in mine warfare justify a great an importance for this element a be accord any of the other element fix installation be increasingly advocate a the problem of area defense emerge the proponent be scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterpart system which detect submarine over wide area be attractive although they can be only burglar alarm mobile force be require to localize and attack detect target since the system be not capable of pinpoint a target such system be expensive and be orient geographically in an over all asw concept dependence on and effort expend for such system should be limit to those with prove capability no general installation should be make until a model installation have be prove and it maximum capability determine in addition proposal for fix installation should be carefully weigh against a counterpart mobile system fix installation will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval system the submarine have become increasingly attractive a an antisubmarine weapon system it operate in it target s environment and any advantage gain therefrom by the target be share by the attacker but the submarine be a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of be ambush

cj74,cj74,informative,learned,2306,because individual class of food differ in their requirement for preservation a number of method have be develop over the year involve one or a combination of procedure such a dehydration fermentation salt chemical treatment can refrigeration and freeze the basic objective in each instance be to make available supply of food during the interval between harvest or slaughter to minimize loss result from the action of microorganism and insect and to make it possible to transport food from the area of harvest or production to area of consumption in early year the preservation of food be essentially relate to survival in the more sophisticate atmosphere of today s develop nation food preservation technique have seek also to bring variety peak freshness and optimum taste and flavor in food at reasonable cost to the consumer with the development of nuclear technology isotopic material and machine radiation source in recent year the possibility of apply ionize radiation to the preservation of food attract the attention of investigator in the unite state and throughout the world an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problem be soon dispel interest remain however in the possibility that it would serve a a useful supplementary method for counteract spoilage loss and for preserve some food at lower over all cost than freeze or without employ heat or chemical with their attendant taste alteration factor responsible for the spoilage of food the chief factor responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuff be microorganism such a bacteria mold and yeast enzyme insect sprout and chemical reaction microorganism be often responsible for the rapid spoilage of food of special concern be the growth of bacteria such a clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous product enzymatic action in store food produce change which can adversely affect the appearance of food or it palatability spoilage by chemical action result from the reaction of one group of component in the food with others or with it environment a in corrosion of the wall of metal container or the reaction of fat with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity sprout be a naturally occur phenomenon in store potato onion carrot beet and similar root vegetable insect infestation be a problem of importance chiefly in store grain the presence of parasitic organism such a trichinella spiralis in pork introduce another factor which must be deal with in food process to permit the storage of food for long period of time a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganism and inhibition of enzymatic action the term sterilization apply to method involve essentially complete destruction of all microorganism food treat in this manner and protect from recontamination by aseptic method of packaging and containment presumably could be store for long period without refrigeration the process of pasteurization involve mild and less prolong heat treatment which accomplish the destruction of most but not all of the microorganism less severe thermal treatment a by blanch or scald serve to inactivate enzyme general effect of ionize radiation ionize radiation can cause the destruction of microorganism and insect involve in food spoilage or at lower dos can inhibit their action it furnish a mean of destroy insect in store grain product a well a certain parasitic organism present in meat deactivation of enzyme be also possible although some type require extremely heavy dos of mrad or more because of undesirable flavor odor color and generally low palatability associate with radiation treatment of this magnitude the inactivation of enzyme be best accomplish prior to irradiation by the conventional heat process method of blanch radiation do not retard the chemical spoilage of food it will however inhibit the sprout of potato and other root vegetable the radiation dos require for the preservation of food be in the follow range for radiosterilization to destroy all organism for long term preservation about mrad for nonacid food of low salt content for radiopasteurization to partially destroy microorganism result vary with type of food storage condition and objective of treatment commonly of the order of mrads but up to about aj for destruction of insect about aj for inhibit the sprout of root vegetable to aj preserve food with ionize radiation lead to some undesirable side effect particularly at the high radiation dosage in this respect the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized food have to date be find to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially process food a number of food be quite acceptable a regard taste and palatability however at dosage substantially less than sterilization level moreover the nutritive value of irradiate food apparently undergo little if any change although some of the fat soluble vitamin be affect by sterilization dos radiation source for irradiation of food the result obtain depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation and x ray gamma and high energy electron radiation be suitable aside from availability and economic consideration each have certain practical advantage for example gamma ray give deep penetration but can not be focus or collimate whereas unidirectional electron beam may be split and direct to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiate selection of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factor include require dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most important cost of the potentially useful source of ionize radiation gamma source cobalt cesium fission product or a reactor irradiation loop system use a material such a an indium salt have receive most attention for food preservation system of the various particle accelerator the van de graff machine resonant transformer and linear accelerator be the principal one available for commercial use cost of the effective energy produce by these source be a major obstacle in the development of food preservation process estimate production cost of radiation energy from machine and nuclide source range from to per aj conventional energy for process food be available in the range of at most a few cent per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mill per kwhr for process steam radiation therefore be at an initial cost disadvantage even though only to per cent a much radiation energy a heat energy be require for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization what be the possibility of lower radiation production cost for the future it have be estimate that for application on a megawatt scale cost might reach value in the neighborhood of cent per kwhr for large scale accelerator or for gamma radiation generate in a reactor core no comparable reduction in the cost of nuclide radiation be foresee such projection however appear highly speculative and the capacity involve be far beyond those foresee for food preservation facility because agricultural activity be seasonal and the area of production and harvest of many food be widely scatter geographically and because of the high cost of transport bulk food item any substantial distance to a central process location the use of large central process station where low cost radiation facility approach the megawatt range might be utilize be inherently impracticable present status of irradiation preservation of food the objective of complete sterilization of food be to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of be store without refrigeration for extend period of time chief interest in radiosterilization reside in the military service for them provide appetizing food under battle or emergency condition be a paramount consideration they require completely sterile food capable of be store without refrigeration preferably item already cook and ready to eat high nutritional value variety palatability and appetizing appearance be important for reason of morale food for rear station which require cook but no refrigeration be also of interest of primary interest be meat radiopasteurization which produce few adverse sensory change in food product have potential usefulness in prolong the keep quality of fresh and refrigerate food item thus food so process might reach more remote market and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability commercial interest be chiefly in this type of treatment a be military interest under peacetime condition the present status of food preservation by ionize radiation be discuss by food class in the follow paragraph meat the radiation process of meat have receive extensive investigation to date the one meat show favorable result at sterilization dos be pork of particular interest to the military service be the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization be superior in palatability to available can pork product test with beef have be largely unsuccessful because of the development of off flavor a prime objective of the army quartermaster corp program be to find the reason for beef s low palatability and mean of overcome it since it be a major and desirable dietary item partly because low level heat treatment be need to inactivate enzyme before radiosterilization treat fresh meat have the appearance of boil or can meat off flavor be a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meat but problem of commercial acceptability remain moderate radiation dos of from to rad can extend the shelf life at f of fresh beef from day to or week however the problem of consumer acceptability remain the preradiation blanch process discolor the treat beef and liquid accumulate in prepackaged cut cook beef irradiate in the absence of oxygen assume an unnatural pink color when lamb and mutton be irradiate at substerilization dos the meat become dehydrate the fat become chalky and again unnatural change in color occur grind meat such a fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization might be think to offer distinctly improve keep quality however a major problem here be one of scale of process grind meat be usually prepare from scrap meat at the local level whereas irradiation at economic volume of production would require central process and distribution facility the problem of color change by blanch and liquid accumulation within the package be the same a for solid cut specialty cook item contain meat portion a in freeze dinner might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization the principal potential advantage would be that the finish product could be transport and store at lower cost under refrigeration instead of be freeze a refrigerate item could also be heat and serve in less time than be require for freeze food of the same type competitive process for preserve meat be by can and freeze cost of can meat be in the range of to cent per pound cost of freeze be in the area of to cent per pound the table on page show cost of can and freeze meat and estimate cost for irradiation under certain assume condition under the condition of comparison it will be note that radiosterilization at mrad be more expensive than can particularly for the cesium source radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium source be in the range of freeze cost irradiation use the nuclide source be more expensive than use of an electron accelerator poultry result of irradiation test with poultry have be quite successful at sterilize dos good palatability result with a minimum of change in appearance taste and odor radiopasteurization have also be successful and the shelf life of chicken can be extend to a month or more under refrigerate storage a compare with about day for the untreated product acceptable taste and odor be retain by the irradiate and refrigerate chicken acceptance of radiopasteurization be likely to be delay however for two reason the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration be become a minimal problem because of constantly improve sanitation and distribute practice and treatment by antibiotic a measure already approve by the federal food and drug administration serve to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about cent per pound seafood fresh seafood product be extremely perishable although refrigeration have serve to extend the storage life of these product substantially increase consumption might be possible if area remote from the seacoast could be serve adequately
cj75,cj75,informative,learned,2242,furthermore it have make an exact assessment of the removal mechanism possible the instrument be show in fig and consist essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which be push along the substrate to remove the coating the force require to accomplish removal be plot by mean of an electronic recorder against distance of removal since the removal force be a function of coating thickness a differential transformer pickup have be incorporate into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness this too be record against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut a number of adjustment feature be include in the hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coating deposit on such substrate a iron and other metal glass wood and plastic surface the measurement of topcoat on primer can also readily be carry out hesiometer result have be find to compare excellently with manual knife scratch test the instrumental method however be about time more sensitive and yield numerical result which can be accurately repeat at will over a period of time if a wedge shape coating of increase thickness be remove from a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle a number of removal mechanism be often observe which depend upon the thickness of the coating at low thickness a cut or shear phenomenon be often encounter a the coating become thick the cut may abruptly change to a crack type of failure if the coating become still thick a peel type failure finally can occur the typical appearance of these various mechanism be illustrate in fig and which be single frame enlargement of high speed movie take during the course of the knife removal process it can be see from fig that the cut removal of a coating from it substrate involve pure cohesive failure of the coating the molecular force hold the coating to the substrate be obviously great than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occur by shear along a plane start at the tip of the knife and extend to the coating surface the picture of fig and show the crack and peel type of removal where the coating be detach by failure in a region at or close to the interface between coating and substrate if the force require to remove the coating be plot against film thickness a graph a illustrate schematically in fig may characteristically result here h be the coating removal force measure parallel to the surface of the substrate and t be the film thickness it can be see that the force be characteristic of the removal process and change abruptly from cut to crack to peel removal also it can be readily see that the cut and peel type of failure show a steady state response while the crack mechanism be of a dynamic nature it should be recall that these three mechanism can occur on the same coating deposit upon the same substrate merely a a function of change in coating thickness presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive property be identical in each case what then be the factor that contribute to these phenomenon why should the practical adhesion of a coating a assess by a knife method change initially increase rather rapidly and then decrease stepwise to very low value a the knife be force through a coating of increase thickness cut mechanism of cohesive failure the cut or shear removal process have be previously describe it be find that the coating be separate from it substrate entirely by cohesive failure the detail of the removal process be show schematically in fig the various force result from the reaction of the remove paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane which make an angle yf with the substrate the action and reaction force be r and af respectively and be equal and opposite in direction all the other force vector be derive from these af be the force require to cut a coating of thickness t from the substrate af be the shear force along the shear plane af and af be the thrust force act against coating and knife respectively af be the normal compressive force act on the shear plane af be the friction force between chip and knife surface and p be the normal force act on the face of the knife yc be the rake angle of the knife yf be the angle the shear plane make with the substrate yt be the friction angle and yb be the angle the resultant make with the plane of the substrate an analysis of the vector relationship show that the rake angle yc and the friction angle yt determine the vector direction af of the force resultant r and af consequently both the rake angle of the knife a well a the friction occur between the back of the remove coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detail mechanism of the cut removal process it be difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of r directly in actual practice the value most readily amenable to measurement be the cut force af and the shear angle aj these two value and the rake angle yc be sufficient to determine the other parameter of these relationship yc be define by the geometry of the knife yf can readily be determine by measure the thickness of the coating before and after cut from the substrate af be instrumentally determine from fig the relationship between these parameter can readily be derive and the cut force be af where yl be the shear strength of the coating and be a parameter of the coating material w be the width of the remove coating and t be it thickness if the cut force af be plot against film thickness a straight line should result pass through the origin and have slope af however in the actual assessment of the cut force by instrumental method for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effect occur which must be take into account and which make the measure value large than the true cut force indicate by eqn blunt knife one of these be the fact that the knife employ no matter how well sharpen will have a slightly round cut edge this signify that yc the rake angle be no long a constant to zero film thickness the curvature of this bluntness be in the case of the carboloy knife employ in the hesiometer determine by the grain size of the polish grit and the tungsten carbide crystal cement together in the knife body and be in the order of to mil the force vector concept of fig can readily be apply to this condition also because the rake angle af at the tip of the knife be very much small or even negative when compare to the value of yc for the major portion of the knife a very rapid increase in cut force with thickness will result this reduce to the relationship af where af be the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicate in eqn af be the thickness of the coating equivalent to the round off of the knife tip af be a straight line first approximation of this roundness and the other symbol be equivalent to those of eqn it can be see that af be a constant and be determine for the most part by the geometry of the knife the blunter the knife the high be the value of af the importance of a hard abrasion resistant knife material like the carboloy employ in the hesiometer immediately become apparent soft knife would blunt very rapidly make the value of af inexact in extreme case of very soft knife this value may even change during the course of a measurement knife friction a second factor which enter into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determine cut force be the frictional resistance cause by the bottom of the knife against the substrate this be not a constant value like af but vary with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultant r and af of fig under equilibrium condition of cut the chip exert a thrust af against the knife which tend to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depend on the vector direction of af the resultant friction force af be thus directly proportional to af and consequently also to film thickness the value of af can readily be assess by determine the frictional force exert on the knife while run over the previously strip coating track under various external loading a straight line relationship be usually observe in a plot of af against load l have slope k and af since the load l under actual cut condition be cause by af it can be see that af the measure force h in cut removal of coating from their substrate consequently can be see to be the sum of that force require to cut the coating af that due to the bluntness of the knife af and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate af or af the first two force be directly interrelate and depend upon film thickness whereas af be independent of these two and be a constant for a give knife coating combination these theoretical relationship be more clearly illustrate in fig and their sum can be see to correlate in form with practical measurement make with the hesiometer a illustrate in the first portion of fig for the cut mechanism chip mechanism of cohesive failure although a large number of coating system particularly at low thickness fail cohesively by the cut mechanism frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place this be a chip dynamic type failure encounter with very brittle coating resin or very highly pigment film this be show in the photomicrograph of fig the basic difference between the continuous cut mechanism and that of the chip mechanism be that instead of shear occur in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture rupture intermittently occur along the shear plane the detail mechanism of this type of failure have be study extensively by merchant for metal cut and the principle find can be directly apply to coating by study high speed movie make of this type of failure the sequence of relationship a schematically illustrate in fig could be observe in the first picture a the knife be just begin to advance into the incline surface which be leave from the previous chip formation in the next the shear plane angle be high and extend to the incline work surface with increase advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extend to the coating surface and the shear angle rapidly decrease eventually rupture occur along the shear plane e and the cycle repeat itself merchant have find that the same basic relationship which describe the geometry and force system in the case of the cut mechanism can also be apply to the discontinuous chip formation provide the proper value of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross sectional area be use consequently if the shear angle yf be replace by the rupture angle af the relationship a describe in eqns and will directly apply the crack mechanism under equilibrium cut condition the chip exert a force af against the coating and an equal opposite force af against the knife in the plane of the substrate a show in fig if the rake angle yc of the knife be high enough and the friction angle yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip be low enough to give a positive value for af the resultant vector r will lie above the plane of the substrate
cj76,cj76,informative,learned,2341,within only a few year foam plastic material have manage to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastic industry and the end be still not yet in sight urethane foam a only one example be only introduce commercially in this country in yet last year s volume probably top million lb and expectation be for a market of million lb by many of the other foam plastic particularly the styrene show similar growth potential and there be even new foam plastic that be yet to be evaluate a this issue go to press for example one manufacturer have announce an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength another report that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use in wire coating application be be investigate on the follow page each of the major commercial foam plastic be describe in detail a to property application and method of process it might be well to point out however some of the new development that have take place within the past few month which might have a bear on the future of the various foam plastic involve in urethane foam for example there have be a definite trend toward the polyether type material which be now available in two component rigid foam system and the emphasis be definitely on one shoot mold most manufacturer also seem to be concentrate on formulate fire resistant or self extinguish grade of urethane foam that be aim specifically at the burgeon build market urethane foam a an insulator be also come in for a good deal of attention in one outstanding example whirlpool corp find that by switch to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerator to make them competitive with electric model much interest have also be express in new technique for process the urethane foam include spraying froth and mold see article p for detail and in meet the demand for urethane foam a a garment interlining new adhesive and new method of laminate foam to a substrate have be develop new technique for automatic mold of expandable styrene bead have help boost that particular material into a number of new consumer application include picnic chest beverage cooler flower pot and flotation type swim toy two other end use area which contribute to expandable styrene s growth during the year be packaging mold insert replace complicate cardboard unit and foam core build panel extrude expandable styrene film or sheet claim to be competitive price wise with paper also show much potential particularly for packaging sandwich panel for build utility shelter that consist of kraft paper skin and rigid styrene foam core also arouse interest in the construction field in vinyl foam the big news be the development of technique for coating fabric with the material for detail see p well hand a more luxurious feel and well insulate property be claim to be the result several company also saw possibility in use the technique for extrude or mold vinyl product with a slight cellular core that would reduce cost yet would not affect physical property of the end product to any great extent reader interest in additional information on foam be refer to the foam plastic chart appear in the technical data section and to the list of reference which appear below urethane foam since the mid s when urethane foam first make it appearance in the american market growth have be little short of fantastic present estimate be that production top the million lb mark in to million lb for flexible or million lb for rigid by production may range from to million lb for flexible and from to million lb for rigid the market that have start to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectation furniture upholstery a just one example can easily take million of pound foam refrigerator insulation be under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer and use of the foam for garment interlining be only now get off the grind with volume potential in the offing basic chemistry urethane foam be basically reaction product of hydroxyl rich material and polyisocyanates usually tolylene diisocyanate blow can be either one of two type carbon dioxide gas generate by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blow through the use of a low boil liquid such a a fluorinated hydrocarbon the most important factor in determine what property the end product will have be quite naturally the type of hydroxyl rich compound that be use in it production originally the main type use be various composition of polyester these be still in wide use today particularly in semi rigid formulation for such application a core for sandwich type structural panel foam in place insulation automotive safety pad arm rest etc more recently polyethers again in vary composition molecular weight and branch have come into use at first for the flexible foam just lately for the rigids the polyether glycol be claim to give flexible urethane a spring back action which be much desire in cushioning although the first polyether foam on the market have to be produce by the two step prepolymer method today thanks to new catalyst they can be produce by a one shoot technique it be possible that the polyether foam may soon be mold on a production basis in low cost mold with more intricate contour and with superior property to latex foam the polyester urethane foam be generally produce with adipic acid polyester the polyether group generally consist of foam produce with polypropylene glycol or polypropylene glycol modify with a triol one shoot v prepolymer in the prepolymer system the isocyanate and resin be mix anhydrously and no foam occur the foam can be accomplish at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution in one shoot the isocyanate polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additive be mix directly and a foam be produce immediately basically this mean that simple process equipment the mixture have good flow characteristic and less external heat the foam reaction be exothermic and develop internal heat be require in one shoot foam although at the same time the problem of control the condition of one shoot foam be critical one property most commercial us of urethane foam require density between and lb cu ft for rigid foam between and lb cu ft for flexible foam this latter figure compare with latex foam rubber at an average of lb cu ft in commercial grade compression strength graph in fig p indicate how the ratio of compressive strength to density vary a the latter be increase or decrease the single curve line represent a specific formulation in a test example by vary the formula this curve may be move forward or backward along the coordinate to produce any desire compression strength density ratio thermal conductivity and temperature resistance in flexible urethane foam we be refer to the range between the high and low temperature under which the material primary performance remain functionally useful in temperature resistance this quality be usually relate to specific property e g flexural tensile strength etc thermal conductivity be directly traceable to the material s porous air cell construction which effectively trap air or a gas in the maze of minute bubble which form it composition these air or gas bubble make highly functional thermal barrier the k factor a term use to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material b t u sq ft of material hr f in of thickness range from to for flexible urethane foam and from to for rigid urethane foam depend upon the formulation density cell size and nature of blow agent use table p show a comparison of k factor rat of a number of commercial insulate material in common use include two different type of rigid urethane foam flexural strength this term refer to the ability of a material to resist bend stress and be determine by measure the load require to cause failure by bend the high density urethane semi rigid foam usually have strong flex fatigue resistance i e the lb cu ft foam have time the flexural strength of the lb cu ft density note that flexural strength be not always improve by simply increase the density nor be the change always proportional from one formulation to another where flexural strength be an important factor be sure that your urethane foam processor be aware of it tensile strength this property refer to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tear apart like compression strength of urethane foam it have a direct relationship to formulation exceptional tensile strength be another of urethane foam s strong feature figure above show the age property of urethane foam a determine by the percent of change in tensile strength during exposure to ultra violet light process urethane there be many way of produce a foam urethane product the foam can be make into slab stock and cut to shape it can be mold it can be pour in place it can be apply by spray gun etc slab stock be still one of the most important form of urethane end product in use today basically the foam machine that produce such stock consist of two or more pump unit a variable mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many case a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidify into foam the ingredient be feed from tank through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermine rate the mix head move back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle it only take a few minute for the foam action to be complete and after a short cure the material can be cut into length a desire much have be do in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finish product profile cut machine be available which can split foam to any desire thickness and produce sine triangle trapezoid and other profile in variable height dimension etc the convolute sheet can be combine to attain certain cushioning effect mechanically rather than chemically also available be a slitter which peel the inside of a fold block of foam and can be use to slit continuous sheet up to yd in length down to in thick the low cost and ease of fabrication of the die for three dimensional foam cut plus the wide variety of shape dimension and contour that can be tailor make to customer requirement have make the technique useful for produce case liner material handle container packaging and cushioning device and such novelty a

system b channel type secondary emission image intensifier c image intensifier base upon the multipactor principle d transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifier tsem tube e cascade of single stage enclose in one common envelope cascade single stage by couple lens system be rather inefficient a the lens system limit the obtainable gain quite severely channel type image intensifier be capable of achieve high gain value they suffer however from an inherently low resolution image intensifier base upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise a far a obtainable resolution be concern however the unavoidable low duty cycle restrict the effective gain tsem tube have be construct show high gain and resolution however electrostatic focus important for many application have not be realize for these device resolution limitation with electrostatic focus might be anticipate due to chromatic aberration furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support can not be tolerate cascade single stage enclose by a common envelope have be construct with high gain and high resolution these tube may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the couple member the electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one the magnification may be small equal or large than unity an electrostatic system suffer generally from image plane curvature lead to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat view screen or interstage coupler be utilize while a magnetic system require accurate adjustment of the solenoid which be heavy and bulky a it will be discuss late peripheral defocusing can be improve on by utilize curve fiber coupler it should be note however that the paraxial resolution be quite similar for both electron optical system it be felt that fiber couple double and multi stage image intensifier will gain considerable importance in the future therefore we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capability of such tube the luminous efficiency and resolution of single stage fiber coupler and finally of the composite tube will be compute it will be show theoretically that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permit the utilization of extremely low incident light level the effect of device and quantum noise associate with such low input level will be describe after these theoretical consideration constructional detail of a fiber couple double stage x ray image intensifier will be discuss measure performance characteristic for this experimental tube will be list the conclusion shall be reach that fiber couple double stage tube represent a sensible and practical approach to high gain image intensification basic design of a fiber couple double stage image intensifier the tube design which form the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be describe now the electron optical system see fig be base in principle on the focus action of concentric spherical cathode and anode surface the inner anode sphere be pierce elongate into a cup and terminate by the phosphor screen the photoelectron emit from a circular segment of the cathode sphere be focus by the positive lens action of the two concentric sphere pass through the negative lens form by the anode aperture and impinge upon the cathodoluminescent view screen the cylindrical focus electrode permit adjustment of the positive lens part by vary the focus potential the anode potential codetermines the gain g and magnification m of the stage both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration be curve concave a see from the anode aperture the field flatten property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilize to alleviate the peripheral resolution loss result with a flat phosphor screen or couple member for the same reason the output fiber plate be planoconcave it expose flat side permit contact photography if a permanent record be desire a it will be show late the field flatten property of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design the second photocathode and both phosphor surface be deposit on the fiber plate substrate the photocathode sensitivity s phosphor efficiency p and anode potential v of the individual stage shall be distinguish by mean of subscript and in the text where require both stage be assume to have unity magnification theoretical discussion of flux gain flux gain of a single stage the luminous gain of a single stage with af flux gain be to a first approximation give by the product of the photocathode sensitivity s amp lumen the anode potential v volt and the phosphor conversion efficiency p lumen watt in general p be a function of v and the current density but it shall here be assume a a constant the luminous efficiency af of a photocathode depend on the maximum radiant sensitivity af and on the spectral distribution of the incident light af by the relation af where af be normalize radiant photocathode sensitivity af be standard visibility function the luminous flux gain of a single stage be give by af if the input light distribution fall beyond the visible range af a expect since af such case be not consider here efficiency of fiber coupler the efficiency of fiber optic plate depend on four factor a numerical aperture n a b end fresnel reflection loss r c internal loss i l d pack efficiency f r the numerical aperture of the fiber be give by af where af the angle af be measure in the medium of index af settle phosphor a generally use in image intensifier have low optical contact with the substrate surface hence af shall be assume the numerical aperture should be in general close to unity this condition can be satisfy e g with af and af or equivalent glass combination a sufficiently good approximation for determine the end reflection loss r can be obtain from the angle independent fresnel formula af for phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surface and assume af we obtain af percent this value may be reduce to percent by mean of a very thin glass layer of index hence the af factor for the output fiber coupler be af a the index of refraction of photosensitive surface of the sbcs type lie around the fresnel loss at the fiber photocathode interface be about percent and the af factor for the interstage coupler be it might be anticipate that multiple coating will reduce end reflection loss even far the internal loss be due to absorption and the small but finite loss suffer in the numerous internal reflection due to deviation from the prescribe cylindrical fiber cross section and minute imperfection of the core jacket interface these loss depend on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular distribution of the incident light explicit expression integral average be give in the literature lack reliable data for some of the variable we be rely on experimental data of about percent internal loss for inch long small m diameter fiber this relatively high value be probably due to the small fiber diameter increase the number of internal reflection since we be consider here relatively small diameter inch fiber plate their average thickness can be keep below inch and their internal loss may be assume a percent per plate the pack efficiency f r of fiber plate do not receive much attention in the literature probably a it be high for the large fiber generally use until rather recently for circular fiber in a closely pack hexagonal array the pack efficiency be give by af where af and be the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribe hexagon for the small diameter fiber now technically feasible and require for about af resolution af the cladding thickness be about m hence af and af thus the efficiency yt coupler be give by af or approximately percent each it must be remember that the fiber plate replace a glass window and a mica membrane in addition to an optical output lens system the efficiency af of an af lens at the magnification af be af neglect absorption the end loss of the couple membrane and the output window af would be percent and percent thus the combine efficiency of the element replace by the two fiber plate with a combine efficiency of be or about six time less than that of the two fiber plate gain of fiber couple image intensifier include the brightness gain af due to the af area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber couple double stage image intensifier be af it be obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximize af for a give input e in the case of the second stage for the first phosphor screen emission be very important the same consideration should govern the choice of the second stage phosphor screen for match with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor e g photographic emulsion we have evaluate the match integral for two type of photocathode s and s and three type of light input the input light distribution consider be p and p phosphor emission and the so call night light n l a give by h w babcock and j j johnson the integral in unit be list in table below theoretical discussion of paraxial device resolution resolution limitation in a single stage the resolution limitation for a single stage be give by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system a well a the resolution capability of the cathodoluminescent view screen the resolution capability of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberration it have be state previously that a minify electrostatic system yield a lower resolution than a magnify system or a system with unity magnification furthermore the chromatic aberration depend on the chosen high voltage in general a high anode voltage reduce chromatic aberration and thus increase the obtainable resolution the luminous gain of the discuss tube be calculate from eq for the possible combination of s and s photocathode and p and p phosphor screen for night light and p light input the p input be of interest because it correspond roughly to the light emission of conventional x ray fluorescent screen the follow efficiency obtain from jedec and rca specification be use af the follow table list the luminous gain value compute accord to eq with af the possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundle have be point out it be obvious that such an influence can only be expect in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output level space charge influence will also decrease at increase voltage electrostatic system of the pseudo symmetric type have be test for resolution capability by apply electronography a resolution of line pair per millimeter appear to be feasible the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decrease with increasingly aggregate thickness with increase anode voltage decrease with decrease porosity thus the advantage of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition and might be impair by the normally use aluminum mirror thus in general elementary light optical effect light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit it should be note that photoluminescence due to bremsstrahlung generate within the view screen by electron impact appear to be important only if anode voltage in excess of kv be utilize it have be state that settle cathodoluminescent phosphor screen may have a limit resolution of af at high voltage value of approximately aj for the far discussion we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of af and phosphor screen resolution of af
cj79,cj79,informative,learned,2246,the set of all decision be call the operate policy or more simply the policy an optimal policy be one which in some sense get the best out of the process a a whole by maximize the value of the product there be thus three component to an optimal design problem the specification of the state of the process stream the specification of the operate variable and the transformation they effect the specification of the objective function of which the optimization be desire for a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentration of the different chemical specie and the temperature or pressure of the stream for the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cool to be supply the way in which the transformation of state depend on the operate variable for the main type of reactor be discuss in the next chapter the objective function be some measure of the increase in value of the stream by process it be the subject of chapter the essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream be transform in a sequence of stage with no feedback be first isolate by bellman he recognize that whatever transformation may be effect in the first stage of an r stage process the remain stage must use an optimal af stage policy with respect to the state result from the first stage if there be to be any chance of optimize the complete process moreover by systematically vary the operate condition in the first stage and always use the optimal af stage policy for the remain stage we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stage proceed in this way from one to two and from two to three stage we may gradually build up the policy for any number at each step of the calculation the operate variable of only one stage need be vary to see how important this economy be let u suppose that there be m operate variable at each stage and that the state be specify by n variable then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operation of order af where a be some number not unreasonably large to proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of fee state must be investigate to allow for interpolation this number will be of the order of af if however we be seek the optimal r stage policy for a give fee state only one search for a maximum be require at the final step thus a number of operation of the order of af be require if all the operate variable be vary simultaneously af operation would be require to do the same job and a r increase this increase very much more rapidly than the number of operation require by the dynamic program but even more important than this be the fact that the direct search by simultaneously vary all operate condition have produce only one optimal policy namely that for the give fee state and r stage in contrast the dynamic program produce this policy and a whole family of policy for any small number of stage if the problem be enlarge to require a complete coverage of fee state af operation be need by the dynamic program and af by the direct search but af be vastly large than r no optimism be more baseless than that which believe that the high speed of modern digital computer allow for use of the crude of method in search out a result suppose that af and that the average operation require only af sec then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennium the principle of optimality thus bring a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process bellman have annunciate in the follow term an optimal policy have the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision be the remain decision must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state result from the first decision this be the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation it appear in a form that be admirably suit to the power of the digital computer at the same time every device that can be employ to reduce the number of variable be of the greatest value and it be one of the attractive feature of dynamic programming that room be leave for ingenuity in use the special feature of the problem to this end the discrete deterministic process consider the process illustrate in fig consist of r distinct stage these will be number in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream so that stage r be the t stage from the end let the state of the stream leave stage r be denote by a vector af and the operate variable of stage r by af thus af denote the state of the fee to the r stage process and af the state of the product from the last stage each stage transform the state af of it fee to the state af in a way that depend on the operate variable af we write this af this transformation be uniquely determine by af and we therefore speak of the process a deterministic in practical situation there will be restriction on the admissible operate condition and we regard the vector a belong to a fix and bound set s the set of vector af constitute the operate policy or more briefly the policy and a policy be admissible if all the af belong to s when the policy have be chosen the state of the product can be obtain from the state of the fee by repeat application of the transformation thus af the objective function which be to be maximize be some function usually piecewise continuous of the product state let this be denote by af an optimal policy be an admissible policy af which maximize the objective function p the policy may not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly be and once the policy be specify this maximum can be calculate by and a a function of the fee state af let af where the maximization be over all admissible policy af when it be necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy be an optimal r stage policy with respect to the fee state af for any choice of admissible policy af in the first stage the state of the stream leave this stage be give by af this be the fee state of the subsequent af stage which accord to the principle of optimality must use an optimal af stage policy with respect to this state this will result in a value af of the objective function and when af be chosen correctly this will give af the maximum of the objective function thus af where the maximization be over all admissible policy af and af be relate to af by the sequence of equation can be solve for af when af be know and clearly af the maximization be over all admissible af the set of equation and the start equation be of a recursive type well suit to programming on the digital computer in find the optimal r stage policy from that of af stage only the function af be need when af have be find it may be transfer into the storage location of af and the whole calculation repeat we also see how the result may be present although if n the number of state variable be large any tabulation will become cumbersome a table or set of table may be set out a in table to extract the optimal r stage policy with respect to the fee state af we enter section r of this table at the state af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function in the third column be give the optimal policy for stage r and in the fourth the result state of the stream when this policy be use since by the principle of optimality the remain stage use an optimal af stage policy with respect to af we may enter section af of the table at this state af and read off the optimal policy for stage af and the result state af proceed in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and if it be desire we can check on af by evaluate af at the last stage it may be that the objective function depend not only on af but also on af a when the cost of the operate policy be consider a moment s reflection show that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case a form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider be af here p represent the value of the stream in state p and q the cost of operate the stage with condition q hence p be the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that be the net profit if af denote the net profit from stage r and af then the principle of optimality give af this sequence of equation may be start with the remark that with no process af there be no profit i e af the discrete stochastic process the process in which the outcome of any one stage be know only statistically be also of interest although for chemical reactor design it be not a important a the deterministic process in this case the stage r operate with condition af transform the state of the stream from af to af but only the probability distribution of af be know this be specify by a distribution function af such that the probability that af lie in some region d of the stage space be af we can not now speak of maximize the value of the objective function since this function be now know only in a probabilistic sense we can however maximize it expect value for a single stage we may define af where the maximization be by choice of af we thus have an optimal policy which maximize the expect value of the objective function for a give af if we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage be know before passage to the next then the principle of optimality show that the policy in subsequent stage should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first then af the maximization be over all admissible af and the integration over the whole of stage space the type of presentation of result use in the deterministic process may be use here except that now the fourth column be redundant the third column give the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r and enter the precede section of the table at this state the discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage be not know before pass to the next be a very much more difficult matter the continuous deterministic process in many case it be not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stage since the state of the stream be transform in a continuous manner through the process we replace r the number of the stage from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which measure the distance of the point consider from the end of the process the word distance be use here in a rather general sense it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process if t be the total length of the process it fee state may be denote by a vector p t and the product state by p q p denote the state at any point t and q the vector of operate variable there
cj80,cj80,informative,learned,2254,a gyro stabilize platform system use restrain gyro be well suit for automatic level because of the characteristic of the gyro platform servo combination the restrain gyro stabilize platform with reasonable response characteristic operate with an approximate equation of motion neglect transient effect a follow af where u be a torque apply about the output axis of the control gyro the platform angle yf be the angle about which the gyro be control this be normally term the gyro input axis degree away from the gyro output or yj axis the gyro angular momentum be define by h thus if the gyro and platform controller combination maintain the platform with zero angular deviation about the yf axis the system can be rotate with an angular velocity af if a torque be supply to the gyro output axis aj it be assume that the gyro be design with electrical torquers so that a torque can be apply about their output ax in the system show in fig the accelerometer output be amplify and the result voltage be apply to the gyro output axis torquer this torque cause the entire system to rotate about the yf axis since the response to af if the polarity be correct the platform rotate in such a direction a to reduce the accelerometer output to zero a the accelerometer output be decrease the torque apply to the gyro output axis decrease and therefore the rate decrease finally when the accelerometer output be zero the entire system remain stationary and the platform be by definition level a mathematical block diagram for the level system be show in fig the platform be initially off level by the angle aj the angle generate by the platform servo yf multiply by g be the effective acceleration act on the accelerometer af be the scale factor of the accelerometer af the voltage af be amplify by af and apply to the gyro torquer with scale factor af finally the gyro stabilize platform characteristic be represent by af the system a indicate in fig be fundamental and simple because the transient effect of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have be neglect with these factor include an upper limit be place on the allowable loop gain by stability consideration in this type of system a high loop gain be desirable because it provide a fast response time when the frequency response characteristic of practical component be consider their effect on stability do not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain the time require for the system to reach a level position be approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain in addition the cutoff frequency for input acceleration be approximately proportional to the servo loop gain i e high loop gain cause the system to respond to horizontal component of acceleration this problem usually determine the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time it must be notice in fig that the accelerometer respond to any input acceleration the equation relate input acceleration to output platform angle be af in practice the preflight level process take place with the system mount in the airframe when the system be arrange for automatic level the platform angle respond to any horizontal component of acceleration act on the accelerometer there be many such component of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gust engine noise turbulence around the vehicle etc one of the greatest problem associate with automatic level be establish a true level in the presence of high level acceleration noise one solution to the problem be to operate with a low loop gain and to include low pass filter this technique cause the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration component such a the platform tilt since a lower loop gain and low pass filter increase the response time a practical compromise must be reach one of the most desirable solution be achieve by the use of a non linear amplifier for af the amplifier be design so that it gain be large for accelerometer signal above a certain threshold level below this level the amplifier gain af be proportional and be of small value in order to provide adequate noise filter the effect be that the platform return from an off level position at a rapid rate until it be nearly level at which point the platform be control by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise have little effect on the level process when the system be on automatic level the gyro drift be cancel by the output of the level system amplifier af the platform actually tilt off level so that the accelerometer output when amplify by af will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift the amount of platform dip require depend upon the scale factor of the system practical level consideration the automatic level system describe in this section be readily adaptable to a gyro stabilize platform consist of three integrate gyro the system require some switch of flight equipment circuit however the level operation can be maintain and control remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform this level system will hold the platform on level automatically a long a the system be actuate a useful by product of this system be that the information necessary to set the gyro drift bias be available from the current necessary to hold the system in level the level process can be accomplish manually and the result be a satisfactory a those obtain with automatic equipment the process consist in turn the platform manually until the output of both accelerometer be zero the turn be accomplish by apply voltage to the gyro torquers describe above in brief the human replace amplifier af in fig and manual level require an appropriate display of the accelerometer output if high accuracy be require in preflight level it be usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer output this also minimize the noise problem with integration the effect of a small acceleration or small platform tilt angle can be see after a time however skill be require on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy also it require more time a compare to the automatic approach manual level be inconvenient if the platform must be maintain accurately level for any prolong period of time the operator must continually supply the correct amount of turn current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift be cancel this process be especially difficult since gyro drift be typically random platform head platform head consist of orient the sensitive axis of the accelerometer parallel to the desire coordinate system of the navigator in simple term it amount to point the platform in the proper direction for purely inertial navigator two technique be available to accomplish the platform head use of external or survey equipment to establish proper head use of the characteristic of the platform component for an indication of true head the choice of the head technique be dependent upon the accuracy requirement field condition and the time available to accomplish the head external determination of head survey technique with the gyro stabilize platform level it can be head in the proper direction by use survey technique the platform accelerometer must be slightly modify for this procedure before the accelerometer be mount on the platform the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determine a mirror be mount on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror be perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit transit a precision transit be set up so that it be align with respect to true north this can be do to a high degree of accuracy by exist survey technique with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometer be sight and the platform be turn until it be align the sight procedure include the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light which be darken by cross hair on the accelerometer mirror when the platform be align the reflect image of the cross hair can be see exactly superimpose upon the original cross hair the image can easily be align with a high degree of accuracy the platform be turn a require by supply current to the appropriate gyro torquers although this technique be simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty do exist the direction of true north must be know for each launch point however this difficulty be not too serious if it be realize that a survey team can establish a true north base line with a few day work in many installation the inertial platform be raise off the grind a considerable height when it be mount in the vehicle before flight with this situation it be difficult to sight in on the platform with survey equipment if the platform be not too high off the grind a transit can be mount on a stand to raise it up to the platform obviously the head accuracy be lessen by such technique since error be introduce because of motion of the stand autocollimator the transit can be replace by an autocollimator this instrument provide an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviation of the platform and can be use to automatically hold the platform on true head the electrical signal from the autocollimator be amplify and supply to the z gyro torquer if the polarity be correct the platform will turn until the head error angle be zero information be also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the z axis gyro if the z gyro be drift a current generate by the autocollimator be deliver to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift if the drift error be systematic it can be cancel with a bias circuit which can be arrange and adjust to supply the require compensate current electrical pickoffs it be possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true head direction and the platform essentially the stator or reference portion of the pickoff be establish with respect to the true head direction and the platform be turn either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal be reduce to zero gyrocompass head gyrocompass alignment be an automatic head system which depend upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true head for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consist of three restrain gyro a coordinate system be use where the sensitive axis of the x accelerometer be parallel to the east west direction at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive axis be parallel to the north south direction at the base point the accelerometer be mount rigidly on the platform thus if one accelerometer be properly align the other be also the input axis of the appropriate gyro be parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometer figure show a platform system with the gyro vector arrange a describe above the platform be level and properly head so that the x gyro input axis be parallel to the east west direction and the y gyro input axis be parallel to the north south direction the input axis of the x gyro when point in the east west direction be always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth if the platform be not properly head the x gyro input axis will see a component of the earth s rotation the sense of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilize to direct the platform into proper head in fig the input axis of the three axis platform be show at some point on the earth the point be at a latitude yl and the platform be at an error in head east the earth be spin at an angular velocity zq equal to one revolution per hr when the platform be level ye be a rotation about the z axis of the platform af since the earth be rotate and the unleveled gyro stabilize platform be fix with respect to a reference in space an observer on the earth will see the platform rotate with respect to the earth

ch02,ch02,informative,government,2360,in most of the less develop country however such programing be at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent only a very few of the more advance one such a india and pakistan have develop systematic technique of programing others have so call development plan but some of these be little more than list of project collect from various ministry while others be statement of goal without analysis of the action require to attain them only rarely be attention give to accurate progress report and evaluation we can help in the plan process neither growth nor a development program can be impose on a country it must express the nation s own will and goal nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner a to promote the development of responsible programing first we can encourage responsibility by establish a condition for assistance on a substantial and sustain scale the definition of objective and the assessment of cost second we can make assistance for particular project conditional on the consistency of such project with the program third we can offer technical help in the formulation of program for development which be adapt to the country s objective and resource this include assistance in assemble the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depend survey the need and requirement over time of broad sector of the economy such a transport agriculture communication industry and power design the financial mechanism of the economy in way that will promote growth without inflation and administrative practice which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of program once establish we must use common sense in apply condition the application of condition in the allocation of aid fund can not of course be mechanical it must be recognize that country at different stage of development have very different capability of meet such condition to insist on a level of performance in programing and budget completely beyond the capability of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth in the more primitive area where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance be limit some activity may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well work out program be available thus we might provide limit assistance in such field a education essential transport communication and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country program in such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with it programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in perform that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country s development be conditional upon programing progress be make at the other end of the spectrum where the more advance country can be rely upon to make well think through decision a to project priority within a consistent program we should be prepare to depart substantially from detail project approval a the basis for grant assistance and to move toward long term support in cooperation with other develop country of the essential foreign exchange requirement of the country s development program d encourage self help the reason for stress self help a systematic approach to development budget and programing be one important kind of self help there be many others it be vitally important that the new u s aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less develop country themselves external aid can only be marginal although the margin a in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive external aid can be effective only if it be a complement to self help u s aid therefore should increasingly be design to provide incentive for country to take the step that only they themselves can take aid advice be not interference in establish condition of self help it be important that we not expect country to remake themselves in our image open society can take many form and within very broad limit recipient must be free to set their own goal and to devise their own institution to achieve those goal on the other hand it be no interference with sovereignty to point out defect where they exist such a that a plan call for factory without power to run them or for institution without train personnel to staff them once we have make clear that we be genuinely concern with a country s development potential we can be blunt in suggest the technical condition that must be meet for development to occur the range of self help the major area of self help be the follow a the effective mobilize of resource this include not only development programing but also establish tax policy design to raise equitably resource for investment fiscal and monetary policy design to prevent serious inflation and regulatory policy aim to attract the financial and managerial resource of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few b the reduction of dependence on external source this include foresee balance of payment crisis with adequate attention to reduce dependence on import and adopt realistic exchange rat to encourage infant industry and spur export it also include provide for the train of national to operate project after they be complete c tap the energy of the entire population for both economic and political reason all segment of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability d honesty in government in many society what we regard a corruption favoritism and personal influence be so accept a consistent with the more of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regard by the local leadership a not only unwarranted but unfriendly yet an economy can not get the most out of it resource if dishonesty corruption and favoritism be widespread moreover tolerance by u of such practice result in serious waste and diversion of aid resource and in the long run generate anti american sentiment of a kind peculiarly damage to our political interest some of the most dramatic success of communism in win local support can be trace to the identification correct or not of communist regime with personal honesty and pro western regime with corruption a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run but it be politically essential in the long run u s position on self help the unite state can use it aid a an incentive to self help by respond with aid on a sustain basis tailor to priority need to those country make serious effort in self help in many instance it can withhold or limit it aid to country not yet will to make such effort there be other country where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those group in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measure to promote growth government be rarely monolithic but there will be still other country where despite the inadequacy of the level of self help we shall deem it wise for political or military reason to give substantial economic assistance even in these case we should promote self help by make it clear that our support assistance be subject to reduction and ultimately to termination e encourage a long term approach development require a long term approach the most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid be the focus of our attention our resource and our energy on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less develop country this be not a short run goal to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it a an enterprise stretch over a considerable number of year and we must encourage the recipient of our aid to view it in the same fashion most of our aid will go to those near self sufficiency how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country in several significant case such a india a decade of concentrate effort can launch these country into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government to government assistance these case in which light be already visible at the other end of the tunnel be one which over the next few year will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance gradually others will move up to the same level the number of country thus favorably situate be small but their people constitute over half of the population of the underdevelop world meantime over the decade of the sixty we can hope that many other country will ready themselves for the big push into self sustain growth in still others which be barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launch the slow process of develop their human resource and their basic service to the point where an expand range of developmental activity be possible aid be a long term process the whole program must be conceive of a an effort stretch over a considerable number of year to alter the basic social and economic condition in the less develop world it must be recognize a a slow act tool design to prevent political and military crisis such a those recently confront in lao and cuba it be not a tool for deal with these crisis after they have erupt the specific reason for a long term approach a the need to budget a period of year many of the individual project for which development assistance be require call for expenditure over lengthy period dam river development scheme transportation network educational system require year to construct moreover on complex project design work must be complete and order for machinery and equipment place month or even year before construction can commence thus a a development program be be launch commitment and obligation must be enter into in a give year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditure to be make in that year the capital expansion program of business firm involve multi year budget and the same be true of country development program b the need to plan investment program more importantly several of the more advance of the less develop country have find through experience that they must plan their own complex investment program for at least year forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they be to be sure that the various interdependent activity involve be all to take place in the proper sequence without such forward plan investment fund be waste because manufacture facility be complete before there be power to operate them or before there be transport to service them or a skilled labor force be train before there be plant available in which they can be employ c the need to allocate country resource most important of all the less develop country must be persuade to take the necessary step to allocate and commit their own resource they must be induce to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policy they must be persuade to adopt the other necessary self help measure which be describe in the precede section the take of these step involve tough internal policy decision moreover once these step be take they may require year to make themselves felt they must therefore be relate to long range development plan provide an incentive if the less develop country be to be persuade to adopt a long term approach the unite state a the principal supplier of external aid must be prepare to give long term commitment in this a in so many aspect of our development assistance activity the incentive effect of the posture we take be the most important one the extent to which we can persuade the less develop country to appraise their own resource to set target toward which they should be work to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priority for their immediate attention and to do the other thing which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic long term basis will depend importantly on the incentive we place before them if they feel that we be take a long term view of their problem and be prepare to enter into reasonably long term association with them in their development activity they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult task require perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other country have do this kind of home work we have respond with long term commitment
ch03,ch03,informative,government,2207,you have hear him tell these young people that during his almost year of service in the congress he have see the kaiser and the hitler and the mussolini the tojo and stalin and khrushchev come and go and that we be pass on to them the free nation that mankind have ever know then i have see the pride of country well in the eye of these young people so i say mr speaker god bless you and keep you for many year not only for this body but for the unite state of america and the free world you remember the word of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone ask him when he be in canada and dean rusk be in europe and vice president johnson be in asia who be run the store and he say the same fellow who have be run it sam rayburn general leave to extend mr mccormack mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all member who desire to do so may extend their remark at this point in the record and also that they may have legislative day in which to extend their remark the speaker pro tempore be there objection to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts there be no objection remark of hon joseph p addabbo of new york mr addabbo it be notably significant that so many member from both side of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn i purposely refrain from add the usual distinction of say that he be from the state of texas i do so because i agree with so many here today that he be the beloved speaker of all the people of the unite state for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our government it be a privilege for u to do honor to this great man who represent not alone his own district but all the people of our country to honor him be to honor ourselves in this my first year a a member of this body i have experience many memorable moment many of these experience be so important that they will be cherish forever by me and like many of you here present i hold a the highlight of all the occasion of my first meet with the honorable speaker of the house at that time he afford me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length a i may need to speak about my background my hop my view on various national and local topic and any problem that i may have be vex with at the time he be fatherly in his handle of all subject with me and tremendously wise in his counsel in conclusion he wish me well and a kindly and humbly a this humane gentleman could express himself he ask to be remember to my wife and child in my short period here i believe that at no time have he be otherwise than the most popular man on both side of the aisle he be most effective in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative accomplishment of this session he easily rise to great occasion even at the height of unpleasantness and excite legislative struggle and a the nation witness these contest he rise even a admit by those who differ with him to the proportion of a hero and a noble partisan i be highly privilege today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant he will ever be my example a a true statesman one who be thoroughly human who affect no dignity and who be endow with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty all dedicate to secure the best interest of the country he have love and serve so long may the divine speaker in heaven bless this country with sam rayburn s continue service here for year to come remark of hon wayne l hay of ohio mr hay it be a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguish chorus of my colleague in this paean of praise respect and affection for speaker sam rayburn in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilize force that he represent in current american government be an almost indispensable source of strength he have become in this half century the grand old man of american history it seem to me that the prayer of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to providence that sam rayburn s vigor and his life remain undiminished through the come decade here briefly in this humble tribute i have seek for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country but the task be beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicate and prodigious contribution sam rayburn have make a an individual a a legislator a a statesman and a a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this nation it happen that i be a legislator from ohio and that i feel deeply about the need the aspiration the interest of my district and my state what sam rayburn s life prove to u all be the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interest of one s own community one s own district one s own state and by that help himself represent even well the sweep and scope of the problem of this the greatest nation of all time for sam rayburn never forget bonham his home community and he never forget texas in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty a legislator to our community our district our state and if we follow the rayburn pattern a consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have follow it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate area must necessarily be reflect in the devotion of our service to our country for what sam rayburn s life in this house teach u be that loyalty and character be not divisive and there be no such thing a be for your country and neglect your district there be no such thing a be diligent about national affair but indifferent about home need the two be a one this may not be the greatest but it certainly come close to be the greatest lesson sam rayburn s career up to this hour teach all of u who would aspire to distinction in political life under our process of government more than that sam rayburn be the very live symbol of an iron clothe integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrate that he can count some of his best friend in the opposition through the most rancorous battle of political controversy and the most bitterly fight national and presidential campaign his character shin a an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility sam rayburn have never have to look back at any of his most devastate fight and ever feel ashamed of his conduct a a combatant under fire or his political manner in the heat of conflict ambition this mean much to the american tradition it be an answer in it way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process be necessarily vicious in it campaign characteristic and the name rayburn be one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for the last half century it be i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it be so massive and so widespread and so complicate and because it go so deep but this we know here be a great life that in every area of american politics give the american people occasion for pride and that have invest the democratic process with the most decent quality of honor decency and self respect i pray to god that he may be spar to u for many year to come for this be an influence the unite state and the whole world can ill afford to lose remark of hon melvin price of illinois mr price all but two of my nine term in the house of representative have be serve under the speakership of sam rayburn of this i be proud i have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carry his greatness and sam rayburn be a great man one who will go down in american history a a truly great leader of the nation he will be consider not only great among his contemporary but a great among all the american who have play a part in the country s history since the begin i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and great american not only because today he establish a record of have serve a speaker of the house of representative more than twice a long a henry clay but because of the contribution he have make to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service a a member of congress speaker rayburn have not limit his leadership a a statesman to his direction of the house in the speaker s chair he have an outstanding record a a legislator since the start of his career in the house in the d congress no one have sponsor more progressive and important legislation than have sam rayburn he be the recognize father of the rural electrification administration and the security and exchange commission but to run the gauntlet of the program sam rayburn bring into be through his legislative effort would fill the page of today s record no great pleasure have come to me in my own service in this house than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great legislator this great texan this great american my sincere wish be that he continue to add to this record he set here today remark of hon john s monagan of connecticut mr monagan sam rayburn be one of the greatest american public figure in the history of our country and i consider that i have be singly honor in the privilege of know sam rayburn and share with him the right and obligation of a member of the house of representative in the congress of the unite state others may speak of speaker rayburn s uniquely long and devote service of his championship of many of the progressive social measure which adorn our statute book today and of his cooperation in time of adversity with president of both of our major party in help to pilot the ship of state through the shoal of today s stormy international sea i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution although sam rayburn affect a gruff exterior in many instance nevertheless he be fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition no one could be more devote than he to the american congress a an institution and more aware of it historical significance in the political history of the world and i shall never forget his move talk deliver in simple yet eloquent word upon the mean of our job a representative in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today s assault upon popular government above all he be a person to whom a fledgling representative can go to discus the personal and professional problem which inevitably confront a new congressman in this role of father

ch04,ch04,informative,government,2316,origin of state automobile practice the practice of state own vehicle for use of employee on business date back over forty year at least one state vehicle be in existence in the state presently own passenger vehicle in comparison to approximately in the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool come into existence in and have be responsible for centralize maintenance and management of state own transportation since that time the motor pool have make exceptional progress in automotive management include establishment of cost bill system record keep analysis of vehicle use and effect economy in vehicle operation car be operate in for an average per mile purchase of state vehicle be handle similarly to all state purchase unit price to the state be considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchase and no payment of state sale or federal excise tax vehicle purchase assignment and use policy the legislature s role in policy determination concern state own vehicle have be confine almost exclusively to appropriate fund for vehicle the meaningful policy govern the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicle have be shape by the state s administrative officer meaningful policy include a kind of car the state should own b when car should be trade c the need and assignment of vehicle d use of car in lieu of mileage allowance e employee take car home and f need for liability insurance on state automobile a review of these policy indicate the state purchase and assign grade of car accord to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle the purchase of compact economy car be be make currently on a test basis car be trade mostly on a three year basis in the interest of economy the factor govern need and assignment of car be flexible accord to circumstance unsuccessful effort have be make to replace high mileage allowance with state automobile it be reasonably economical for the state to have driver garage state car at their home the state have recently undertake liability insurance for driver of state car automobile practice in other state a survey of practice and or policy in other state concern assignment and use of state automobile reveal several point for comparison with rhode island s practice forty seven state assign or provide vehicle for employee on state business two other state provide vehicle but only with legislative approval state which provide automobile for employee assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool twenty six state operate a central motor pool for acquisition allocation and or maintenance of state own vehicle nineteen state report law policy or regulation for assign state vehicle in lieu of pay mileage allowance of these state the average change over point at which a car be substitute for allowance be mile per year mileage allowance mileage allowance for state employee be of two type a actual mileage and b fix monthly allowance actual mileage allowance be itemize reimbursement allow employee for the use of personally own vehicle on state business at the rate of per mile fix monthly allowance be reimbursement for the same purpose except on a non itemize basis both allowance be govern by condition and restriction set forth in detail in the state s travel regulation rhode island s reimburseable rate of per mile for use of personally own car compare favorably with other state rat the average of state rat be per mile rhode island s rate of per mile be considerably lower than reimburseable rat in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a per mile average actual mileage allowance be well administer and not unduly expensive for the state the travel regulation requirement and procedure govern reimbursement be control properly and not overly restrictive fix monthly allowance be a controversial subject they have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measure flat payment over per month be more expensive to the state than the assignment of state own vehicle travel allowance travel allowance include subsistence have be revise by administrative official recently and compare favorably with other state allowance with few exception traveler on state business be allow actual travel expense and per day subsistence travel allowance be well regulate and pose little problem in administration and or audit control origin of state automobile practice general background it be difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobile for use of employee in rhode island few record be available concern the subject prior to those that be available shed little light the registry of motor vehicle indicate that at least one state automobile be register a far back a it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buy automobile be at least forty year old the best reason that can be advance for the state adopt the practice be the advent of expand highway construction during the s and s at that time highway engineer travel rough and dirty road to accomplish their duty use privately own vehicle be a personal hardship for such employee and the matter of provide state transportation be felt perfectly justifiable once the principle be establish the increase in state own vehicle come rapidly and reason other than employee need contribute to the growth table immediately below show the rate of growth of vehicle and employee this rate of increase do not signify anything in itself it do not indicate loose management ineffective control or poor policy but it do show that automobile have increase steadily over the year and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employee in the past twenty year the ratio of state own automobile per state employee have vary from to then to to now whether there be too few automobile in or too many now be problematical the fact be simply that state own vehicle have remain in practically the same proportion a employee to use them history and operation of the motor pool while the origin of state own automobile may be obscure subsequent development concern the assignment use and management of state automobile can be relate more clearly prior to automobile be the individual responsibility of the agency to which assign this responsibility include all phase of management it embrace determine when to purchase and when to trade vehicle who be to drive when and where repair be to be make where gasoline and automobile service be to be obtain and other allied matter in however the nation be at war gasoline and automobile tire be ration commodity the state be confront with transportation problem similar to those of the individual it meet these problem by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more popularly call the motor pool a centralize operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation the motor pool then a now have headquarter facility in providence and other garage locate throughout the state it be organizationally the responsibility of the department of public work and be finance on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contribute to the pool s operation in the pool s operation be transfer to the newly create department of administration an agency establish a the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government the management of state own vehicle since that time have be describe in a recent report in the follow manner under this new management considerable progress appear to have be make the agency of government be now bill for the actual cost of service provide to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all car whereas the maintenance rotary fund have in the past sustain loss considerably beyond expectation the introduction of the cost bill system plus other control refinement have result in keep the fund on a proper work basis one indication of the merit of the new management be find in the fact that during the period while total annual mileage put on the vehicle increase the total maintenance cost increase only in order to far refine the management of passenger vehicle on july the actual title to every vehicle be transfer by executive order to the division of method research and office service the objective behind this action be to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicle note so far a state police car be concern only their replacement be under this division this tie in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state own car to the extent that vehicle be not retain beyond the point where maintenance cost in light of depreciation become excessive moreover it allow the present management to reassign vehicle so that mileage will be more uniformly distribute throughout the fleet for example if one driver put on mile per year and another driver mile per year their car will be switch so that both car will have mile after two year rather than mile and relate high maintenance cost and mile respectively the motor pool be a completely centralize and mechanize operation it handle all type of vehicle maintenance but concentrate more on service station activity than on extensive vehicle repair it contract with outside repair garage for much of the latter work where the pool excel be in it compilation of maintenance and cost data study and analysis pool record reveal in detail the cost per mile and mile per gallon of each vehicle the mile travel in one year or three year the period when vehicle cost become excessive and when car should be trade for sound economy from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and relate data in vehicle average an operate cost of per mile base on this figure and consider depreciation cost of vehicle pool personnel have determine that travel in excess of mile annually be more economical by state car than by payment of allowance for use of personally own vehicle they estimate far that with sufficient experience and when cost data of compact car be compile the break even point may be reduce to mile of travel per year table show operate cost data of state vehicle select at random one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operation be the lack of adequate central garage facility present pool quarter at two location in providence be crowd antiquate and in general make for inefficient operation in term of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational need a stock and repair equipment good facility would be a decide help to pool operation and probably reduce vehicle cost even more purchasing practice the purchase of state own vehicle be handle in the same manner a all other purchase of the state request be make by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agency to which assignment of car will be make bid be evaluate by the division of purchase with the assistance of pool staff and award for the purchase of the automobile be make to the low responsible bidder unit price for state vehicle be invariably lower than to the general public the reason be obvious the state be buy in quantity and it have no federal excise or state sale tax to pay until the state be also entitle to a special type of manufacturer discount through the dealer in that ownership of all vehicle rest with the state motor pool car be pay for with fund appropriate to the agency but transfer to the rotary fund mention early this be a normal governmental procedure which reflect more accurately cost accounting principle the assignment and use of vehicle after purchase be another matter to be cover in detail late vehicle purchase assignment and use policy probably the most important of all matter for review be the broad administrative policy govern the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicle the legislature s role in policy determination in this area for year have be confine almost solely to the amount of fund appropriate annually for the purchase and operation of vehicle the more meaningful policy have be leave to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state the director of administration
ch05,ch05,informative,government,2228,the rhode island property tax there be a time some year ago when local taxation by the city and town be sufficient to support their own operation and a part of the cost of the state government a well for many year a state tax on city and town be pay by the several municipality to the state from the proceed of the general property tax this tax be discontinue in since that time the demand of the citizen for new and expand service have place financial burden on the state which could not have be foresee in early year at the same time there have be an upgrade and expansion of municipal service a well thus there have come into be a situation in which the state must raise all of it own revenue and in addition must give assistance to it local government this financial assistance from the state have become necessary because the local government themselves find the property tax or at least at the rat then exist insufficient for their requirement consequently there have develop several form of grant in aid and share tax a well a the unrestricted grant to local government for general purpose whose adoption accompany the introduction of a sale tax at the state level notwithstanding state aid the local government be continue to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthen the property tax this be be do both by the revaluation of real property and by seek out form of personal property hitherto neglect or ignore taxation of tangible movable property in rhode island have be generally of a hand off nature due possibly to several reason local assessor in the main be not well pay and have inadequate office staff the numerous category of this component of personal property make locate extremely difficult and the inexperience of the majority of assessor in evaluate this type of property problem of tax personal property among the many problem in the tax of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two be significant situs fair and equitable assessment of value these problem be not local to rhode island but be recognize a common to all state situs of property although the law of the various state in general specify the situs of property i e residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exception regard boat airplane mobile home etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment rhode island law specify that all real estate be taxable in the town in which it be situate it also provide for the taxation of all personal property belong to inhabitant of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of non resident in this state in define personal property it specifically mention all ship or vessel at home or abroad intangible property be taxable wherever the owner have a place of abode the great portion of the year although a similar situs for tangible property be mention in the statute this be cancel out by the provision that definite kind of property and all other tangible property situate or be in any town be taxable where the property be situate this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at it location on december both boat and aircraft would fall within this category a well a motor vehicle the location of the latter now be determine for tax purpose at the time of registration and it be now accept practice to consider a motor vehicle a be situate where it be garage obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the st day of december in view of the acceptance accord the status of motor vehicle for tax purpose in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boat or aircraft a recent example of this problem be the fly of six airplane on december from the newport airpark in middletown to the north central airport in smithfield this situation result in both town claim the tax and probably justifiably middletown base it claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be tax to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have have his actual place of abode for the large portion of the twelve month next precede the first day of april in each year the smithfield tax assessor in turn claim the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situate or be in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be tax to such person in the town where say property be situate assessment of value this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value be a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation be dependent on local assessor who in general be non professional and part time personnel take an individualistic approach to the problem this account for the wide variance in assessment practice of movable tangible property in the various municipality in rhode island this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time a a state uniform system of evaluation be establish or through mutual agreement of the local assess official for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopt the rhode island public expenditure council in it publication once comment the most realistic way of face up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for assess all taxable property an adequately staff and equip state assess office could apply uniform method and standard which would go far toward produce equitable assessment on all property throughout the state a single statewide assess unit would eliminate the difference and complication that be inherent in a system of different and independent assess unit the institute of public administration in it report to the state fiscal study commission in recommend consolidate and centralize all aspect of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organize and equip for the job the result setup it be declare would be similar to that which be in successful operation in a number of metropolitan county a large or large than rhode island practice in rhode island to determine the practice and attitude of municipal government concern tangible movable property a questionnaire be send to all local government assessor or board of assessor in rhode island the reply from each individual town be not give in detail because the question ask the personal opinion of the several assessor and be not necessarily the establish policy of the town in each case there be legitimate reason for difference of opinion among the assessor a a whole and among the public official in each town these opinion of the assessor be of significance in indicate what their think seem to be at the present time in reply to a question of whether they now tax boat airplane and other movable property exclude automobile nineteen say that they do and twenty that they do not the wording of the question be quite general and may have be subject to different interpretation one assessor check boat only another trailer and tractor one mention house trailer and two others refer to trailer without specify the type in two case airplane only be indicate it be difficult to tabulate exactly what be mean in each individual situation but the conclusion may be draw that town do not ass movable personal property and of the remainder only certain type be value for tax purpose boat be indicate specifically by only one of the five town know to tax boat it would seem then that movable property and equipment be not tax a a whole but that certain type be tax in town where this be bind to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property so few answer the question relate to their effort to ass movable property that the result be inconclusive only four town indicate that they make any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind of great interest be a question a to whether movable property be assess accord to it location or ownership fifteen state that it be accord to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen do not answer twenty seven assessor state that they be in favor of improve mean for assess movable personal property and only five be oppose seven others express no opinion on this point there be fairly general agreement that assessor would like to do more than they be do now it be not clear however whether they be think of all movable property or only of boat trailer aircraft or certain other type of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular town another question that be ask of the assessor be whether they favor the assessment of movable property at it location or at the residence of the owner eighteen vote for assessment by the town in which it be locate and eleven prefer assessment by the town in which the owner reside ten others make no reply of those who have an opinion it seem that assessment by location be prefer there be one vote for location be the place where the property be situate for the great portion of the twelve month precede the assessment date to summarize it may be say that there be no one prevail practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessor would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location be prefer on the basis of their present knowledge the need for great knowledge be evident from their reply boat a personal property tax of boat interest have be show for a number of year by local assessor in the possibility of tax boat assessor in rhode island be charge not only with place a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specify amount a order by a city council or financial town meet it have be obvious to the assessor particularly those in shore community that boat comprise the large category of tangible personal property which they have be unable to reach through their professional organization the rhode island tax official association the question of tax boat long have be debate and discuss no satisfactory solution have be find but this be due more to the difficulty inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessor it have be estimate that the value of boat in rhode island water be something in excess of fifty million dollar exclude commercial boat it be obvious that this be a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessor of those town where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation it be know that at least five town barrington bristol narragansett newport and westerly place some value on some boat for tax purpose however few be tax and the owner and location of most boat be unknown to the assessor on the date of assessment of town valuation no one really know how many boat there actually be or what their aggregate value may be slightly more than boat be register with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law only a few more than boat have be register with the division of harbor and river at the end of the boating season but many have be take out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane bring the season to an early close the assessor association meet at narragansett in september devote it session to a discussion of the boat problem

ch07,ch07,informative,government,2436,special district in rhode island it be not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special district in rhode island however a word should be mention in regard to them a independent unit of government there be forty seven special district government in rhode island exclude two regional school district four housing authority and the kent county water authority these forty seven special purpose government have the authority to levy tax to borrow money own property sue and be sue and in general to exercise normal corporate power unlike city and town however they do not have to submit any financial statement to the state bureau of audit it be not an exaggeration to say that the state government have little or no fiscal control over these unit of government in addition to the collection of service charge the special district levy annual property tax of approximately fiscal year in other state comparative data a review of practice in other state regard fiscal uniformity be pertinent to this report include in the find be forty six state include rhode island end their fiscal year on june the other four state end on vary date alabama sept new york march pennsylvania may and texas august in sixteen state the fiscal year ending of the city june be the same a that of the state alaska arizona california delaware massachusetts montana nevada new mexico north carolina north dakota oklahoma oregon vermont west virginia wyoming and hawaii in eleven state the fiscal year of the city end on december while the state fiscal year end on june arkansas colorado indiana kansa new hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington and wisconsin in eight state whose fiscal year close on june a majority of their city close their fiscal year on december georgia iowa kentucky maine maryland minnesota virginia and south carolina one state alabama close it fiscal year on september and all city in the state with one exception also close fiscal year on september mississippi close it fiscal year on june while all of it city close their fiscal year on september pennsylvania close it fiscal year on may all of it city close their fiscal year on december the remain twelve state have vary fiscal year for the state city and local government however only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation in which the sundry unit of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity fiscal uniformity advantage and disadvantage advantage an excellent summary of advantage concern the uniform fiscal year and coordinate fiscal calendar be contain in a paper present by a public finance authority recently he list among the value of fiscal uniformity the uniform fiscal year require compliance with common sense administration of local finance adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spend the uniform fiscal year ensure conformance with another common sense rule that of have cash in the bank before check be draw it enable town to make more economical purchase and to take advantage of cash discount the uniform fiscal year promote more careful budget and strengthen control over expenditure by fix the tax rate in advance of spend upper limit be set on expenditure the uniform fiscal year bring the town s fiscal year into line with that of the school which expend the large share of local disbursement this greatly simplify the town s bookkeeping and financial report the uniform fiscal year eliminate interest charge on money borrow in the form of tax anticipation note furthermore tax collection not immediately need for current expenditure may be invest in short term treasury note augment the town s miscellaneous revenue and reduce the tax levy the uniform fiscal year facilitate inter town comparison of revenue and expenditure when town have the same fiscal year it be relatively easy to make meaningful comparison and a the cost of local government increase the demand for such comparison also increase town have different fiscal year be difficult to compare of all advantage probably none be more important than the elimination of tax anticipation note borrowing in anticipation of current tax and other revenue be a routine procedure of the majority of municipality at all time it may be by bank loan sale of note or warrant or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrant in any event it be a form of borrowing which could be and should be render unnecessary it elimination would result in the save of interest cost heavy when short term money rat be high and in freedom from dependence on credit which be not always available when need most this type of borrowing can be reduce to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of tax be institute and the first payment place near the opening of the fiscal year any approach toward such a system look toward save and security it should be note that there be other and equally important reason for establish meaningful intergovernmental report base on a uniform fiscal year both the federal and state government commence their fiscal year on july both unit of government contribute increasingly large sum of money to the several local government in this state a indicate below it have be say that when local government revenue be mostly produce locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year be no great handicap but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the state local share of responsibility for certain important function this be no long true the haphazard fiscal year calendar be an obstacle to the plan of clear and efficient state local revenue and expenditure relationship disadvantage although there be many sound reason for adopt uniform and coordinate fiscal year in rhode island there be also certain difficulty encounter these involve more the mechanic employ in adjust to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantage to the principle one problem be a matter of shift date the other be how to finance the transition little can be do about the change of date this be an inherent part of adjust fiscal calendar it usually mean a confuse and disgruntle tax pay public for a period of time but cooperation and understand between local official and the citizenry help lessen this problem the other problem be the matter of finance the transition period in the several city and town this will be cover more fully late it should be keep in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the propose plan be directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city fortunately there be no city or town in the state with one or two possible exception that be in too difficult a position to finance the propose change sacrifice will have to be make in some case but it be to the municipality s advantage to finance the change over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation note indefinitely adjust the fiscal calendar the advantage of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronize fiscal and tax collection calendar be sufficiently great for rhode island municipality to exert effort to secure them the type of program desire can be determine by the nature and extent of the adjustment need two feature be immediately evident first the present situation be too vary to be systematize by any single formula second the shift to a uniform july to june fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendar of the great majority of city and town there be at least two problem to consider one be a matter of adjust the fiscal calendar the other be how to finance the adjustment when necessary the latter matter be consider in detail in a late section twelve city and town in rhode island presently indicate some plan to establish a uniform and or coordinate fiscal tax year calendar plan vary from the talk stage to establish special committee to accomplish this end what be important here be that many of the city and town recognize the need for improve fiscal practice and be take the initiative to obtain them an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout the state indicate that transition may not be a painful a be commonly think however it must be stress that much depend upon the financial condition of the individual city and town involve the adjustment need to establish a uniform and coordinate fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island base on a july to june year be show below no adjustment need six city and town be presently on a july to june fiscal year and have coordinate their tax collection year with it no change be require for these town these municipality include barrington lincoln middletown newport north kingstown and south kingstown adjustment of fiscal year one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so a to make all tax installment due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year adjustment of tax collection year six city and town be now on a july to june fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity these city and town include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central fall and woonsocket simultaneous adjustment two city to be consider providence and cranston be an enigma both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendar however neither of these two city be on the desire july to june fiscal year the adjustment to a uniform and coordinate fiscal period could be accomplish relatively easily for them in that both city end their fiscal year on september they could levy tax for an interim period of nine month commence with september and ending with june these three installment date would be october january and april providence and november february and may cranston both would start their new fiscal year on july their tax collection calendar could then be july october january and april providence and august november february and may cranston under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be use the same installment period vary adjustment the remain twenty three town have fiscal year which end prior to june all of these town will require adjustment of both their fiscal and tax collection year assume an adjustment to the july to june fiscal year the require adjustment of the tax collection year and the town involve be show in table method of finance adjustment aside from the matter of adjust the fiscal and tax calendar there be the problem of finance the adjustment when this be necessary it should be emphasize strongly that adjustment in fiscal date or adoption of interim budget do not necessarily mean finance over and above normal governmental requirement in many community there be simply no financial problem it be only a matter of adjust accounting method careful fiscal plan and management or some like combination of technique in other municipality the difficulty in overcome the financial burden have be sufficiently great to dishearten proponent of fiscal year change fortunately such case in rhode island be more the exception than the rule a show early in table the several city and town use widely vary fiscal and tax collection calendar in addition no two rhode island community be identical in relation to their over all financial condition these factor practically insure that no single finance formula be feasible each situation must be study and a plan develop that take into consideration such factor a the effect of the exist and prospective tax calendar the financial condition of the treasury and the length of the transition interval suitable plan range from those that be very easy to develop to those that be difficult to formulate and require borrowing range from short term serial note to long term bond the financial problem where it exist usually stem from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period for those community which have financial difficulty in effect adjustment there be a number of alternative any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem

ch11,ch11,informative,government,2254,another recent achievement be the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product be relatively non volatile this work give a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiate a value which have be determine by a less direct method and raise this property to percent above that accept a few year ago similar measurement be be initiate to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride the development and test of new apparatus to measure other property be near completion in one of these an explode wire device to study system thermodynamically up to af and atmosphere pressure a major goal be achieve the accuracy of measure the total electrical energy enter an explode wire during a few microsecond be verify when two independent type of comparison with the heat energy produce have an uncertainty of less than percent this agreement be consider very good for such short time interval the method of calibration employ a fix resistance element a a calorimeter the element be insert in the discharge circuit in place of the explode wire and the calorimetric heat of the element be measure with high accuracy this be use a a reference for compare the ohmic heat and the electrical energy obtain from the measure current through the element and the measure voltage across the element a high speed shutter have be develop in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion the shutter consist of two part a fast opening part and a fast close part use edgerton s method the fast close action be obtain from the blacken of a window by explode a series of parallel lead wire the fast opening of the shutter consist of a piece of aluminum foil approximately af place directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera the opening action be obtain when a capacitor charge to high voltage be suddenly discharge through the foil during the discharge the magnetic force set up by the passage of current cause the edge of the foil to roll inward toward it center line thus allow light to pass into the camera experiment have show that the shutter be percent open in about microsecond the shutter aperture may be make large or small by change the foil area and adjust the electrical energy input to the foil laboratory measurement of interstellar radio spectrum besides the well know hydrogen line at cm wavelength the spectrum of extraterrestrial radio source may contain sharp line characteristic of other atom ion and small molecule the detection and study of such line spectrum would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas cloud and perhaps planetary atmosphere among the most likely producer of detectable radio line spectrum be the light diatomic hydride oh and ch somewhat less likely source be the heavy hydride sh sih and aj very small concentration of these hydride should be detectable in interstellar gas concentration a low a af molecule per af may be sufficient a compare to the af hydrogen atom s af require for detection of the cm line high sensitivity in radio telescope be achieve by reduce the bandwidth of the receiver therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequency be an astronomical search for the radio spectrum of these molecule feasible to secure precise measurement of these frequency a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy have be start since conventional method be insensitive at the low frequency of these molecular transition the paramagnetic resonance method be be use instead this involve the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shift the low frequency spectrum to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measure with optimum sensitivity the first diatomic hydride investigate by the paramagnetic resonance method be the oh radical result of this experiment include the frequency of the two strong spectral line by which oh may be identify in interstellar gas the frequency be and af with an uncertainty of af success in observe these spectral line have so far apparently be confine to the laboratory extraterrestrial observation have yet to be report preparation be be make for similar experiment on ch and sh radical low temperature thermometry the bureau be pursue an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration service in the range to af the effort and accomplishment fall into three main category absolute thermometry base upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involve principally study of the behavior of germanium resistor and helium vapor pressure measurement see p acoustical interferometer an acoustical interferometer have be construct and use with helium gas a the thermometric fluid to measure temperature near and af such an interferometer provide a mean of absolute temperature measurement and may be use a an alternative to the gas thermometer when value of temperature derive with this instrument be compare with the accept value associate with liquid helium vapor pressure difference of about and millidegree respectively be find this result be preliminary and work be continue resistance thermometer carbon resistor and impurity dope germanium resistor have be investigate for use a precision secondary thermometer in the liquid helium temperature region several germanium resistor have be thermally cycle from to af and their resistance have be find to be reproducible within millidegree when temperature be derive from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tube be jacket through most of the liquid helium preliminary calibration of the resistor have be make from to af at every af the estimate standard deviation of the data for two of the resistor be millidegree and for the third resistor millidegree vapor pressure method the reproducibility of helium vapor pressure thermometer have be investigate in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from to af surface temperature gradient have be find to exist in liquid helium bath contain in and liter metallic storage dewar the gradient be about one half of a millidegree at af but increase to several millidegree for bath temperature slightly great than the yl point a hydrostatic head correction have be neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressure or temperature for the bulk liquid helium however the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor pressure measurement for the bulk liquid helium unless precaution be take to isolate the tube which pass through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface it have also be observe in helium that large discrepancy can exist between surface vapor pressure and those pressure measure by a vapor pressure thermometer this have be attribute to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modify to reduce the helium film flow pressure transducer for pvt measurement precise pressure volume temperature measurement on corrosive gas be dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer a prototype which fulfill the requirement be develop and thoroughly test the transducer be a null type instrument and employ a stretch diaphragm in thick and in in diameter a small pressure unbalance displace the diaphragm and change the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulate plate space in apart for af spherical concave back surface support the diaphragm when excessive pressure be apply and prevent the stress within the diaphragm from exceed the elastic limit over a temperature range from to af and at pressure up to atm an overload of psi apply for a period of one day result in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter of mercury transport property of air a year study of the transport property of air at elevate temperature have be complete this project be carry out under sponsorship of the ballistic missile division of the air research and development command u s air force and have a it goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical bind a significant effect discover during the study be the existence of prandtl number reach value of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region another effect discover be the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tend to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature difference straddle the nitrogen dissociation region be present the result of the study base on collision integral compute from the late critically evaluate data on intermolecular force in air will be report in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity thermal diffusion and diffusion

of australia canada the netherlands unite kingdom u s s r unite state and west germany meet at the nb to devise mean for reach international agreement on a temperature scale between and af a a first step toward this goal arrangement be work out for compare the scale now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometer for calibration by each national laboratory such a group of thermometer be obtain and calibrate at the aj these thermometer have now be send to the unite kingdom for calibration at the national physical laboratory temperature symposium during the last week of march columbus ohio be the site of the fourth symposium on temperature it measurement and control in science and industry the symposium which be jointly sponsor by the american institute of physic the instrument society of america and the national bureau of standard attract nearly one thousand registrant include many from abroad the bureau contribute to the plan and success of the symposium through the effort of mr w a wildhack general chairman and dr c m herzfeld program chairman dr a v astin nb director open the day session with introductory remark follow which a total of twenty six paper be give throughout the week by nb scientist from both the washington and boulder laboratory atomic physic in addition to the basic program in wavelength standard spectroscopy solid state physic interaction of the free electron and atomic constant which be necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress the bureau have strengthen it activity in laboratory astrophysics the program in infrared spectroscopy be undergo reorientation toward wavelength standard in the far infrared the application of infrared technique to solid state study and increase emphasis on high resolution instrumentation two data center have be establish for the collection index critical evaluation and dissemination of bibliography and critical value in the field of transition probability and collision cross section laboratory astrophysics transition probability under the sponsorship of the office of naval research and the advance research project agency a data center be establish to gather and index all publish information on atomic transition probability an exhaustive survey be make of the literature and a primary reference file of approximately reference be catalogue select bibliography and table of available data be now in preparation a wall stabilize high current arc source be construct and use to study transition probability of atomic hydrogen and oxygen this apparatus will also be use to measure transition probability of a large number of other element a study of the hydrogen line profile indicate that a measurement of these profile can be use to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that be reliable to about af percent a set of table contain spectral intensity for line of element a observe in a copper matrix in a d c arc be complete and publish study of the intensity data indicate that they may be convert to approximate transition probability these data be not of the precision obtainable by the method previously mention but the vast number of approximate value available will be useful in many area atomic energy level research continue on the very complex spectrum of the rare earth element new computer and automation technique be apply to these spectrum with considerable success

ch13,ch13,informative,government,2408,mr dooley mr speaker for several year now the commuter railroad serve our large metropolitan area have find it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expand population want and be entitle to have the cause of the decline of the commuter railroad be many and complex high tax loss of revenue to government subsidize highway and air carrier to name but two and the solution to the problem of the commuter line have be equally vary range all the way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service there have be a number of sound plan propose but none of these have be implement instead we have stand idly by watch our commuter railroad service decline and have fail to offer a help hand though the number of people flow in and out of our metropolitan area each day have increase tremendously since world war total annual rail commutation drop million for to nowhere have this decline be more painfully evident than in the new york city area here the new york central railroad one of the nation s most important carrier have alone lose percent of it passenger since at this time of crisis in our nation s commuter railroad a new threat to the continue operation of the new york central have appear in the form of the chesapeake ohio railroad s proposal for control of the baltimore ohio railroad the new york central have point out that this control if approve by the interstate commerce commission would give the combine c o b o railroad a total of point serve in common with the new york central not only be this kind of duplication wasteful but it give the combine system the ability to take freight traffic away from the new york central and other railroad serve the area the new york central note the freight traffic most susceptible to raid by the c o b o provide the backbone of central s revenue these revenue make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire new york central system a well a the new york area commuter and terminal freight service if these service be to be maintain the new york central must have the revenue to make them possible the new york central today handle percent of all southbound commuter traffic come into new york city this be a million operation involve employee who work on commuter traffic exclusively a blow to this phase of the central s operation would have serious economic consequence not only to the railroad itself but to the people per day who be provide with efficient reasonably price transportation in and out of the city there be a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful c o b o merger scheme the central have point out the logic of create a strong balance competitive two system railroad service in the east be so obvious that b o be publicly commit to the approach outline here detail study of the plan be well underway though far from completion these study indicate beyond a doubt that save would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroad concern their investor their customer their user and to the public at large then abandon the study in the face of their promise outlook for all concern b o enter on again off again negotiation with c o which result in the present situation in the light of the fact at hand however new york central intend to pursue the objective of help to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest the interstate commerce commission will commence it deliberation on the propose c o b o merger on june obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force the new york central to far curtail it commuter operation by give undue competitive advantage to the line that wish to merge however there be a more profound consideration to this propose merger than profit and loss that be will it serve the long range public interest for the past year congress have advocate a carefully plan balance and competitive railway system we must ask ourselves which of the two alternative will help the commuter the two way b o c o merger or the three way new york central b o c o merger which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholder but the interest of all the travel public mr lindsay mr speaker i rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper the new york time on the occasion of a major change in it top executive command arthur hay sulzberger have be a distinguish publisher of this distinguish newspaper and it be fit that we take due notice of his major contribution to american journalism on the occasion of his retirement i be please to note that mr sulzberger will continue to serve a chairman of the board of the new york time mr sulzberger s successor a publisher be mr orvil e dryfoos who be president of the new york time co and who have be with the time since mr dryfoos outstanding career a a journalist guarantee that the high standard which have make the time one of the world s great newspaper will be maintain i be also please to note that mr john b oakes a member of the time staff since have be appoint a editorial page editor mr oakes succeed charles merz editor since who now become editor emeritus i should like at this time mr speaker to pay warm tribute to arthur hay sulzberger and charles merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguish career in american journalism my heartiest congratulation go to their successor orvil e dryfoos and john b oakes who can be count upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the new york time the people of the th district of new york and i a their representative in congress take great pride in the new york time a one of the great and authoritative newspaper of the world mr stratton mr speaker in my late newsletter to my constituent i urge the imposition of a naval blockade of cuba a the only effective method of prevent continue soviet armament from come into the western hemisphere in violation of the monroe doctrine yesterday i have the privilege of read a thoughtful article in the u s news world report of may which discuss this type of action in more detail include both it advantage and it disadvantage under leave to extend my remark i include the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the article from the u s news world report your congressman samuel s stratton report from washington may cuban s s r whatever may have be the setback result from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebel to establish a beachhead on the castro hold mainland last week there be at least one positive benefit and that be the clear cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian dominate military base in fact one of the major reason for the failure of the ill star expedition appear to have be a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba have be get this russian military equipment somehow the picture and story of soviet t tank on cuban beach and russian mig jet fighter strafe rebel troop have bring home to all of u the stark blunt truth of what it mean to have a russian military base mile away from home russian tank and plan in cuba jeopardize the security of the unite state violate the monroe doctrine and threaten the security of every other latin american republic once the full extent of this russian military penetration of cuba be clear president kennedy announce we would take whatever action be appropriate to prevent this even if we have to go it alone but the latin american republic who have be rather incline to drag their foot on take action against castro also react swiftly last week by finally throw cuba off the inter american defense board for year the unite state have be try to get these country to exclude castro s representative from secret military talk but it take the picture of the migs and the t tank to do the job there be a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week you can see it for example in the extensive effort president kennedy have make to enlist solid bipartisan support for his action toward both cuba and lao effort a i see it which be be direct by the way toward support for future action not for those already past what the next move will be only time of course will tell personally i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba we simply can t tolerate far russian weapon include the possibility of long range nuclear missile be locate in cuba obviously we can t stop them from come in however just by talk a naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe doctrine would be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an abrupt end to soviet penetration of our hemisphere from u s news world report may next for cuba an arm blockade look at castro now cockier than ever with arm and agent to threaten the america how can the unite state act blockade be one answer offer by expert in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish castro too this be the question now face president kennedy how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere on april the white house report that a total embargo of remain u s trade with cuba be be consider it aim to undermine far cuba s economy weaken castro another strategy bold and tough be also attract notice in washington a naval and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro blockade in the view of military and civilian expert could restore teeth to the monroe doctrine it could halt a flood of communist arm and strategic supply now reach castro it could stop cuban re export of gun and propaganda material to south america it would be the most severe reprisal short of declare war that the unite state could invoke against castro it be the strategy of blockade therefore that be suddenly at the center of attention of administration official member of congress officer in the pentagon a a possible course of action it also be the center of debate and be raise many question among these question what would a cuba blockade take military expert say a tight naval blockade off cuban port and at the approach to cuban water would require two naval task force each build around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about plan and several destroyer the navy on april announce it be bring back the carrier shangri la from the mediterranean increase to four the number of attack carrier in the vicinity of cuba more than other big navy ship be no less than a day s sailing time away to round out the blockade force submarine would be need to locate identify and track approach vessel land base radar would help with this task so would radar picket ship a squadron of navy jet and another of long range patrol plan would add support to the carrier task force three requirement go with a blockade it must be proclaim the blockade force must be powerful enough to enforce it and it must be enforce without discrimination once these condition of international law be meet country that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk blockade runner can be stop by gunfire if necessary search and hold at least temporarily they could be send to u s port for rule whether cargo should be confiscate what could a blockade accomplish plenty say the expert in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe doctrine by oppose communist interference in the western hemisphere it could by avoid direct intervention provide a short of war strategy to meet short of war infiltration primary target would be shipment of tank gun aviation gasoline and ammunition come from russia and czechoslovakia shipment of arm from western country could similarly be seize a contraband in a total blockade action could also be take against ship bring in chemical oil textile and even foodstuff at time three ship a day from the soviet bloc be unload in cuban port
ch14,ch14,informative,government,2422,from it inception in with the passage of public law th congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program have be to assist the state by mean of grant in aid to return disable men and woman to productive gainful employment the authority for the program be renew several time until the vocational rehabilitation program be make permanent a title of the social security act in up to this time and for the next eight year the service provide disable person consist mainly of train counseling and placement on a job recognize the limitation of such a program the th congress in pass p l which broaden the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration service to remove or reduce disability and which revise the finance structure recent change despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disable person in the first eleven year after the exist program be still see to be inadequate to cope with the nation s backlog of an estimate two million disable to assist the state therefore in rehabilitate handicap individual so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capability the rd congress enact the vocational rehabilitation amendment of p l these amendment to the vocational rehabilitation act be design to help provide for more specialize rehabilitation facility for more shelter and half way workshop for great number of adequately train personnel for more comprehensive service to individual particularly to the homebound and the blind and for other administrative improvement to increase the program s overall effectiveness financial aspect under the law a it exist until the federal government make grant to the state on the basis of population match state expenditure on a basis under p l th congress the federal government assume responsibility for of necessary state expenditure in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disable and for of the necessary cost of provide client with rehabilitation case service throughout these year the statutory authorization be for such sum a be necessary to carry out the provision of the act the amendment completely change the finance of the vocational rehabilitation program provide for a three part grant structure for basic support extension and improvement and research demonstration train and traineeship for vocational rehabilitation and in addition for short term train and instruction the first part of the new structure that for support the basic program of vocational rehabilitation service be describe in this section subsequent section on grant describe the other category of the grant structure the follow table show for select year the authorization appropriation allotment base federal grant to state and state match fund for this part of the grant program method of distribute fund description of formula in order to assist the state in maintain basic vocational rehabilitation service section of the amend act provide that allotment to state for support of such service be base on need a measure by a state s population and fiscal capacity a measure by it per caput income the act far provide for a floor or minimum allotment set at the level which be call the base allotment and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each state it stipulate in addition that all amount remain a a result of impose the ceiling and not use for insure the floor be redistribute to those state still below their maximum these provision be design to reflect the difference in wealth and population among the state with the objective that a vocationally handicap person have access to need service regardless of whether he reside in a state with a low or high per caput income or a sparsely or thickly populate state the provision be also design to avoid disruption in state program already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of fund on the basis of wealth and population alone method of computing allotment the method use in computing the allotment be specifically set forth in the act the term state mean the several state the district of columbia the virgin island guam and puerto rico the term unite state include the several state and the district of columbia and exclude the virgin island guam and puerto rico and prior to alaska and hawaii the follow step be employ in calculation for each state except puerto rico guam the virgin island and prior to alaska and hawaii determine average per caput income base on the last three year see source of data below for per caput income data to be use in this step determine the average per caput income for the u s base on the last three year see source of data below for per caput income data to be use in this step determine the ratio of to the average per caput income of the u s divide by the result obtain in item above determine for each state except the virgin island guam and puerto rico and prior to alaska and hawaii that percentage which bear the same ratio to a the particular state s average per caput income bear to the average per caput income of the u s multiply the result obtain in item above by the result obtain for each state in item above determine the particular state s allotment percentage by law this be for the virgin island guam and puerto rico alaska and hawaii have fix allotment percentage in effect prior to fiscal year in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from the result obtain in item above except that no state shall have an allotment percentage less than nor more than if the result difference for the particular state be less or more than these extreme the state s allotment percentage must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme square each state s allotment percentage determine each state s population see source of data below for population data to be use in this step multiply the population of each state by the square of it allotment percentage multiply result obtain in item above by result obtain in item above determine the sum of the product obtain in item above for all the state for each state make all computation set forth in item to above and then add the result obtain for each state in item determine the ratio that the amount be allot be to the sum of the product for all the state divide the amount be allot by the result obtain in item above determine the particular state s unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year multiply the state product in item above by the result obtain in item above determine if the particular state s unadjusted allotment result obtain in item above be great than it maximum allotment and if so lower it unadjusted allotment to it maximum allotment each state s unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceed it minimum allotment describe in item below by a percentage great than one and one half time the percentage by which the sum be allot exceed must be reduce by the amount of the excess determine if the particular state s unadjusted allotment result obtain in item above be less than it minimum base allotment and if so raise it unadjusted allotment to it minimum allotment regardless of it unadjusted allotment each state be guarantee by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it receive in fiscal year increase by a uniform percentage of which bring total allotment to all state up to the fund recoup by reduction in item above be use first to increase the unadjusted allotment to the specify minimum in those state where the unadjusted allotment be less than the minimum allotment item above and second to increase uniformly the allotment to those state whose allotment be below their maximum with adjustment to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceed it maximum additional note on allotment for the state which maintain two separate agency one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind and one for the rehabilitation of person other than the blind the act specify that their minimum base allotment shall be divide between the two agency in the same proportion a it be divide in fiscal year fund allot in addition to their minimum allotment be apportion to the two agency a they may determine match requirement explanation of match formula a be the case with the allotment provision for support of vocational rehabilitation service the match requirement be also base on a statutory formula prior to in order to provide match for the minimum base allotment state fund have to equal state fund prior to and since the rest of the support allotment be match at rat relate to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot of state or federal participation in total program cost the percentage of federal participation in such cost for any state be refer to in the law a that state s federal share for purpose of this explanation this percentage be refer to a the state s unadjusted federal share begin in the match requirement for the base allotment be be adjust upward or downward a require a year so that by the entire support allotment will be match on the basis of a pivot state share with maximum and minimum state share of and respectively the pre rate of federal participation with respect to any state s base allotment a well a the adjust rate in effect during the period be designate by the statute a that state s adjust federal share the provision for determine a state s unadjusted federal share be design to reflect

brace between the roof beam be place flush with the inside of the wall mortar be pour between this brace and the inch block on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding for detail see inset fig the first one or two roof board mark e in fig be slip into place across the roof beam from outside the shelter these board be nail to the roof beam by reach up through the open space between the beam from inside the shelter concrete block be pass between the beam and put on the board the roof block be in two layer and be not mortar together work on the roof continue in this way the last roof board be cover with block from outside the shelter when the roof block be all in place the final row of wall block be mortar into position the structure be complete see fig build plan be on page solid concrete block relatively heavy and dense be use for this shelter these block be sell in various size so it seldom be necessary to cut a block to fit solid block be recommend because hollow block would have to be fill with concrete to give effective protection brick be an alternative if they be use the wall and roof should be inch thick to give the same protection a the inch solid concrete block the illustration in fig show how to lay a concrete block wall more detail instruction may be obtain from your local build supply house and craftsman other source of information include the national concrete masonry association south dearborn street chicago ill the portland cement association west grand avenue chicago ill and the structural clay product association washington d c aboveground double wall shelter an outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be build with concrete block see fig double wall shelter most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter plan be on page and this shelter could be build in region where water or rock be close to the surface make it impractical to build an underground shelter two wall of concrete block be construct at least inch apart the space between them be fill with pit run gravel or earth the wall be hold together with metal tie place in the wet mortar a the wall be build the roof show here fig be a inch slab of reinforce concrete cover with at least inch of pit run gravel an alternate roof perhaps more within do it yourself reach could be construct of heavy wooden roof beam overlay with board and waterproofing it would have to be cover with at least inch of pit run gravel the material for a double wall shelter would cost about contractor charge would be additional the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection pre shape metal shelter pre shape corrugate metal section or pre cast concrete can be use for shelter either above or below grind these be particularly suitable for region where water or rock be close to the surface they form effective fallout shelter when mound over with earth a show in figure material for this shelter would cost about a contractor probably would be require to help build it his charge would be add to the cost of material this shelter a show on page would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation an alternate hatchway entrance show on page would reduce the cost of material to the national lumber manufacturer association washington d c be develop plan to utilize specially treat lumber for underground shelter construction the structural clay product institute washington d c be work to develop brick and clay product suitable for shelter construction underground concrete shelter an underground reinforce concrete shelter can be build by a contractor for about to depend on the type of entrance the shelter show would provide almost absolute fallout protection the illustration fig show this shelter with the roof at grind level and mound over the same shelter could be build into an embankment or below grind level plan for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance be show on page and another type of shelter which give excellent fallout protection can be build a an add room to the basement of a home under construction it would add about to the total cost of the home the shelter illustrate in figure be base on such a room build in a new home in the washington d c area in the spring of important consideration common to each type of shelter be arrangement of the entrance ventilation radio reception light the entrance must have at least one right angle turn radiation scatter somewhat like light some will go around a corner the rest continue in a straight line therefore sharp turn in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter ventilation be provide in a concrete block basement shelter by vent in the wall and by the open entrance a blower may be instal to increase comfort a blower be essential for the double wall shelter and for the underground shelter it should provide not less than cubic foot per minute of air per person vent pip also be necessary a show in fig and but filter be not radio reception be cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation a soon a the shelter be complete a radio reception check must be make it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad broadcast light be an important consideration continuous low level light may be provide in the shelter by mean of a cell hot shoot battery to which be wire a milliampere flashlight type bulb test have show that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least day with a spare battery a source of light for week or more would be assure a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those period when a bright light be need there should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter a power may continue in many area other consideration if there be outside window in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be shield a show in the appendix page other basement window should be block when an emergency threaten basement wall that project above the grind should be shield a show in the appendix page in these shelter the entrance should be not more than foot wide bunk or material to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter wall be complete the basement or belowground shelter also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection live in a shelter the radioactivity of fallout decay rapidly at first forty nine hour after an atomic burst the radiation intensity be only about percent of what it be an hour after the explosion but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous therefore civil defense instruction receive over conelrad or by other mean should be follow a battery power radio be essential radiation instrument suitable for home use be available and would be of value in locate that portion of the home which offer the best protection against fallout radiation there be a possibility that battery power radio with build in radiation meter may become available one instrument thus would serve both purpose your local civil defense will gather it own information and will receive broad information from state and federal source it will tell you a soon a possible how long to stay in your shelter how soon you may go outdoors how long you may stay outside you should be prepare to stay in your shelter full time for at least several day and to make it your home for day or long a checklist in the appendix page tell what be need family with child will have particular problem they should provide for simple recreation there should be a task for everyone and these task should be rotate part of the family should be sleeping while the rest be awake to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent task that will keep the family busy record such a diary can be keep the survival of the family will depend largely on information receive by radio a record should be keep of the information and instruction include the time and date of broadcast family ration probably will be necessary blower should be operate periodically on a regular schedule there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation have decay enough to allow use of the whole basement however a much time a possible should be spend within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum the housekeeping problem of live in a shelter will begin a soon a the shelter be occupy food medical supply utensil and equipment if not already store in the shelter must be quickly gather up and carry into it after the family have settle in the shelter the housekeeping rule should be spell out by the adult in charge sanitation in the confine of the family shelter will require much think and plan provision for emergency toilet facility and disposal of human waste will be an unfamiliar problem a cover container such a a kitchen garbage pail might do a a toilet a gallon garbage can with a tightly fit cover could be use to keep the waste until it be safe to leave the shelter water ration will be difficult and should be plan carefully a portable electric heater be advisable for shelter in cold climate it would take the chill from the shelter in the begin even if the electric power fail after an attack any time that the heater have be use will make the shelter that much more comfortable body heat in the close quarter will help keep up the temperature warm clothe and bed of course be essential open flame heat or cook should be avoid a flame would use up air some family already have hold weekend rehearsal in their home shelter to learn the problem and to determine for themselves what supply they would need if an attack find you without a prepare shelter few area if any be a good a prepare shelter but they be worth know about a family dwell without a basement provide some natural shielding from fallout radiation on the grind floor the radiation would be about half what it be outside the best protection would be on the grind floor in the central part of the house a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one tenth of the outside level the safe place be the basement corner least expose to window and deep below grind if there be time after the warn the basement shielding could be improve substantially by block window with brick dirt book magazine or other heavy material shelter in apartment build large apartment build of masonry or concrete provide well natural shelter than the usual family dwell in general such apartment afford more protection than small build because their wall be thick and there be more space the central area of the grind floor of a heavily construct apartment build with concrete floor should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwell the basement of such an apartment build may provide a much natural protection a the specially construct concrete block shelter recommend for the basement of a family dwell the federal government be aid local government in several place to survey residential commercial and industrial build to determine what fallout protection they would provide and for how many people the problem for the city apartment dweller be primarily to plan the use of exist space such plan will require the cooperation of other occupant and of the apartment management
ch16,ch16,informative,government,2346,a former du pont official become a general motor vice president and set about maximize du pont s share of the general motor market line of communication be

motor eight operate division the fisher body division long control by the fisher brother under a vote trust even though general motor own a majority of it stock follow an independent course for many year but by and resistance have collapse and it purchase from du pont compare favorably with purchase by other general motor division competitor come to receive high percentage of general motor business in late year but it be likely that this trend stem at least in part from the need of general motor outstrip du pont s capacity the fact that stick out in this voluminous record be that the bulk of du pont s production have always supply the large part of the requirement of the one customer in the automobile industry connect to du pont by a stock interest the inference be overwhelm that du pont s command position be promote by it stock interest and be not gain solely on competitive merit u s at this court agree with the trial court that consideration of price quality and service be not overlook by either du pont or general motor u s at however it determine that neither this factor nor the fact that all concern in high executive post in both company act honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that his action be in the best interest of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone include du pont s competitor outweigh the government s claim for relief this claim a submit to the district court and dismiss by it f supp allege violation not only of of the clayton act but also of and of the sherman act the latter provision proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempt combination or conspiracy to monopolize such trade however this court put to one side without

restraint or monopoly or the substantial lessen of competition have occur or be intend u s at thus a find of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize be exclude from the court s decision indeed a already note the court proceed on the assumption that the executive involve in the deal between du pont and general motor act honorably and fairly and exercise their business judgment only to serve what they deem the best interest of their own company this however do not bar find that du pont have become pre eminent a a supplier of automotive fabric and finish to general motor that these product constitute a line of commerce within the mean of the clayton act that general motor share of the market for these product be substantial and that competition for this share of the market be endanger by the financial relationship between the two concern the statutory policy of foster free competition be obviously further when no supplier have an advantage over his competitor from an acquisition of his customer s stock likely to have the effect condemn by the statute we repeat that the test of a violation of be whether at the time of suit there be a reasonable probability that the acquisition be likely to result in the condemn restraint the conclusion upon this record be inescapable that such likelihood be prove a to this acquisition u s at on the basis of the find which lead to this conclusion the court remand the case to the district court to determine the appropriate relief the sole guidance give the court for discharge the task commit to it be this the judgment must therefore be reverse and the cause remand to the district court for a determination after far hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effect

hold to appoint amici curia to represent the interest of the stockholder of du pont and general motor and to consider the procedure to be follow in the subsequent hearing take place on september at the outset the government s spokesman explain that counsel for the government and for du pont have already hold preliminary discussion with a view to arrive at a relief plan that both side could recommend to the court du pont he say have propose disenfranchisement of it general motor stock along with other restriction on the du pont general motor relationship the government deem these suggestion inadequate have urge that any judgment include divestiture of du pont s share of general motor counsel for the government invite du pont s view on this proposal before recommend a specific program but state that if the court desire or if counsel for du pont think far discussion would not be profitable the government be prepare to submit a plan within thirty day counsel for du pont indicate a preference for the submission of detail plan by both side at an early date no previous antitrust case he say have involve interest of such magnitude or present such complex problem of relief the submission of detail plan would place the issue before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract the court adopt this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carry it out the government submit it propose decree on october the plan call for divestiture by du pont of it share of general motor stock by equal annual distribution to it stockholder a a dividend over a period of ten year christiana security company and delaware realty investment company major stockholder in du pont and the stockholder of delaware be

income tax consequence of the government s plan on may the commissioner announce his rule the annual dividend pay to du pont stockholder in share of general motor stock would be taxable a ordinary income to the extent of du pont s earnings and profit the measure for federal income tax purpose of the dividend to individual stockholder would be the fair market value of the share at the time of each annual distribution in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholder the measure would be the less of the fair market value of the share or du pont s tax basis for them which be approximately per share the force sale of the general motor stock own by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholder of delaware and deposit with the trustee would result in a tax to those party at the capital gain rate du pont s counterproposal be file on may under it plan du pont would retain it general motor share but be require to pass on to it stockholder the right to vote those share

of view the concept of the oneness of a marry couple may reflect an abide belief that the communion between husband and wife be such that their action be not always to be regard by the criminal law a if there be no marriage by make inroad in the name of law enforcement into the protection which congress have afford to the marriage relationship the court today continue in the path chart by the recent decision in wyatt v unite state u s where the court hold that under the circumstance of that case a wife could be compel to testify against her husband over her objection one need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there be other thing in american life which be also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself one of these be the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage the court s opinion dogmatically assert that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine do not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine enthrone an unreality into a rule of law i be not easily persuade that a rule accept by so many people for so many century can be so lightly dismiss but in any event i submit that the

justice hearing officer s report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation a to his claim all in violation of the fifth amendment the trial judge decide that the administrative procedure of the act be fully comply with and refuse to require the production of such document petitioner be find guilty and sentence to month imprisonment the court of appeal affirm f d we grant certiorari in view of the importance of the question in the administration of the act u s we have conclude that petitioner s claim be control by the rationale of gonzales v unite state u s and unite state v nugent u s and therefore affirm the judgment petitioner register with local board no boulder colorado on march his answer to the classification questionnaire reflect that he be a minister of jehovah s witness employ at night by a sugar producer he claim d classification a a minister of religion devote a minimum of hour a month to preaching on november he be classify in class a on november he write the board protest this classification he again state that he be a regular minister that he be devote an average of hour a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to to hour in other ministerial duty and that he oppose war in any form thereafter he be classify o on april after some six month of full time pioneer petitioner discontinue devote hour a month to preaching but fail to so notify his local board in a periodic review the local board on july reclassify him a and uphold this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home upon administrative approval of the reclassification he be order to report for induction on june but fail to do so he be not prosecute however and his case be subsequently reopen in the light of sicurella v unite state u s he be again reclassify a by the local board there follow a customary department of justice hearing at which petitioner appear in his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggest that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant train and service on march however the department recommend approval of the a classification it grind for this recommendation be that while petitioner claim before the local board august a evidence by it memorandum in his file of that date that he be devote hour per month to actual preaching the headquarters of the jehovah s witness report that he be no long do so and on the contrary have relinquish both his pioneer and bible student servant position it report that he now devote only some hour per month to public preaching and from to hour per month to church activity his claim be therefore so highly exaggerate the department conclude that it cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith the appeal board furnish petitioner a copy of the recommendation in his answer thereto he advise the board that he have make no such statement in and assert that his only claim to pioneer be in the appeal board however unanimously concur in the department s recommendation upon return of the file to the local board petitioner be again order to report for induction and this prosecution follow his failure to do so petitioner first contend that the department deny him procedural due process by not give him timely opportunity before it final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board a to his claim of devote hour to actual preaching but the statement of the local board attribute this claim to petitioner be in his file he admit that he know it be open to him at all time and he could have rebut it before the hearing officer this he fail to do assert that he do not know it to be in his file apparently he never take the trouble to find out nevertheless he have ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board after the recommendation of the department be forward to the appeal board that be the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial this he do we find in gonzales v unite state supra that this be the control reason why copy of the recommendation should be furnish a registrant we say there that it be necessary that a registrant be give an opportunity to rebut the department s recommendation when it come to the appeal board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification u s at we fail to see how such procedure result in any prejudice to petitioner s contention which be consider by the appeal board and deny by it a be say in gonzales it be the appeal board which render the selective service determination consider final in the court not to be overturn unless there be no basis in fact estep v unite state u s u s at but there be other contention which might be consider more difficult at his trial petitioner seek to secure through subpoena duce tecum the longhand note of the department s hearing officer evensen a well a his report thereon petitioner also claim at trial the right to inspect the original federal bureau of investigation report to the department of justice he allege no specific procedural error or evidence withhold nor do he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation report might disclose section j of the act a we have hold do require the department s recommendation to be place in a registrant s file gonzales v unite state supra but there be nothing in the act require the hearing officer s report to be likewise turn over to the registrant while the regulation formerly require that the hearing officer s report be place in the registrant s file this requirement be eliminate in moreover the hearing officer s report be but intradepartmental be direct to the attorney general and of course be not the recommendation of the department it be not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receive many and to which he may give his approval or rejection it be but part of the whole process within the department that go into the make of the final recommendation to the appeal board it be also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer s note be furnish to the appeal board hence the petitioner have full opportunity to traverse the only conclusion of the department on file with the board petitioner know that the department s recommendation be base not on the hearing officer s report but on the statement of the local board in his file have have every opportunity to rebut the find of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner can not now claim that he be deny due process because he do not succeed it appear to u that the same reason apply to the production of the hearing officer s report and note at the trial in addition petitioner have fail to show any particular need for the report and note while there be now allegation of the withholding of favorable evidence develop at the hearing and a denial of a full and fair hearing no such claim be make by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process moreover his testimony at trial never develop any such fact in the light of these circumstance a well a the fact that the issue at trial in this respect center entirely on the department s recommendation which petitioner repudiate but which both the appeal board and the court below find support by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officer s report and note finally petitioner say that he be entitle to inspect the fbi report during the proceed before the hearing officer a well a at the trial he do receive a resume of it the same that be furnish the appeal board and he make no claim of it inaccuracy even now no such claim be assert he base his present contention on the general right to explore indicate that he hop to find some discrepancy in the resume but this be fully answer by unite state v nugent supra there we hold that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitle conscientious objector to no guarantee that the fbi report must be produce for their inspection u s at even if we be not bind by nugent petitioner here would not be entitle to the report the recommendation of the department a well a the decision of the appeal board be base entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report
ch18,ch18,informative,government,2250,foreign policy in it total context with this enlarge role in mind i should like to make a few suggestion what we in the unite state do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happen in the rest of the world we in this department must think about foreign policy in it total context we can not regard foreign policy a something leave over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy have be extract foreign policy be the total involvement of the american people with people and government abroad that mean that if we be to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in term of the total context of our situation it be the concern of the department of state that the american people be safe and secure defense be not a monopoly concern of the department of defense it be also the concern of the department of state that our trade relationship with the rest of the world be vigorous profitable and active this be not just a pass interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce we can no long rely on interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve difference between this and other department assistant secretary of state will now carry an increase burden of active formulation and coordination of policy mean must be find to enable u to keep in touch a regularly and a efficiently a possible with our colleague in other department concern with foreign policy i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action every policy officer can not help but be a plan officer unless we keep our eye on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present the movement of event be so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future be essential if we be to think accurately about the present if there be anything which we can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the process by which we come to decision on matter on which we must act promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affair action take today be often far more valuable than action take several month late in response to a situation then out of control there will of course be time for delay and inaction what i be suggest be that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulty i also hope that we can do something about reduce the infant mortality rate of idea an affliction of all bureaucracy we want to stimulate idea from the bottom to the top of the department we want to make sure that our junior colleague realize that idea be welcome that initiative go right down to the bottom and go all the way to the top i hope no one expect that only presidential appointee be look upon a source of idea the responsibility for take the initiative in generate idea be that of every officer in the department who have a policy function regardless of rank far i would hope that we could pay attention to little thing while observe the operation of our government in various part of the world i have felt that in many situation where our policy be good we have tend to ignore minor problem which spoil our main effort to cite only a few example the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy the attitude of a u n delegate who experience difficulty in find adequate housing in new york city or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstance in our capital can easily be direct against the unite state and all that it stand for dozen of seemingly small matter go wrong all over the world sometimes those who know about them be too far down the line to be able to do anything about them i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little thing go wrong have the responsibility for bring these to the attention of those who can do something about them if the department of state be to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follow that the ambassador be expect to take charge overseas this do not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interest responsible fashion he be expect to know about what be go on among the representative of other agency who be station in his country he be expect to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can if any official operation abroad begin to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestion for remedial action the problem of a policy officer it occur to me that you might be interest in some thought which i express privately in recent year in the hope of clear up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy be all about and what it mean and of develop a certain compassion for those who be carry such responsibility inside government i try to do so by call to their attention some of the problem that a senior departmental policy officer face this mean practically everybody in this room whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine the senior policy officer may be move to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimulus an idea in his own head the suggestion of a colleague a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another department a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad the file of an item for the agenda of the unite nation or of any other of dozen of international body a news item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization a request for assistance from some private american interest abroad et cetera ad infinitum the policy officer life with his antenna alert for the question which fall within his range of responsibility his first think be about the question itself be there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what be it for he know that the first and sometimes most difficult job be to know what the question be that when it be accurately identify it sometimes answer itself and that the way in which it be pose frequently shape the answer chewing it over with his colleague and in his own mind he reach a tentative identification of the question tentative because it may change a he explore it far and because if no tolerable answer can be find it may have to be change into one which can be answer meanwhile he have be think about the fact surround the problem fact which he know can never be complete and the general background much of which have already be lose to history he be appreciative of the expert help available to him and draw these resource into play take care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlie their frequently policy orient conclusion he know that he must give the expert his place but he know that he must also keep him in it he be already begin to box the compass of alternative line of action include do nothing he know that he be think about action in relation to a future which can be perceive but dimly through a merciful fog but he take his bear from the great guideline of policy well establish precedent the commitment of the unite state under international charter and treaty basic statute and well understand notion of the american people about how we be to conduct ourselves in policy literature such a country paper and national security council paper accumulate in the department he will not be surprise to find that general principle produce conflict result in the factual situation with which he be confront he must think about which of these principle must take precedence he will know that general policy paper write month before may not fit his problem because of crucial change in circumstance he be aware that every moderately important problem merge imperceptibly into every other problem he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it can not be handle without relation to the whole when the whole be too large to grasp he must think of others who have a stake in the question and in it answer who should be consult among his colleague in the department or other department and agency of the government which american ambassador could provide helpful advice be private interest sufficiently involve to be consult what be the probable attitude of other government include those less directly involve how and at what stage and in what sequence be other government to be consult if action be indicate what kind of action be relevant to the problem the selection of the wrong tool can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself can the president or the secretary act under exist authority or will new legislation and new money be require should the action be unilateral or multilateral be the matter one for the unite nation or some other international body for if so the path lead through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which add still another dimension to the problem respect for the opinion of mankind what type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be condition by the readiness of the country to sustain it he be interest in public opinion for two reason first because it be important in itself and second because he know that the american public care about a decent respect for the opinion of mankind and give probable public attitude about which reasonably good estimate can be make what action be call for to insure necessary support may i add a caution on this particular point we do not want policy officer below the level of presidential appointee to concern themselves too much with problem of domestic politics in recommend foreign policy action in the first place our business be foreign policy and it be the business of the presidential leadership and his appointee in the department to consider the domestic political aspect of a problem mr truman emphasize this point by say you fellow in the department of state don t know much about domestic politics this be an important consideration if we sit here read editorial and look at public opinion poll and other report that cross our desk we should realize that this be raw undigested opinion express in the absence of leadership what the american people will do turn in large degree on their leadership we can not test public opinion until the president and the leader of the country have go to the public to explain what be require and have ask them for support for the necessary action i doubt for example that month before the leadership begin to talk about what come to be the marshall plan any public opinion expert would have say that the country would have accept such proposal the problem in the policy officer s mind thus begin to take shape a a galaxy of utterly complicate factor political military economic financial legal legislative procedural administrative to be sort out and handle within a political system which move by consent in relation to an external environment which can not be under control and the policy officer have the hound of time snap at his heel
ch19,ch19,informative,government,2194,while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular project require special maturity and some open only to men or to woman the peace corp should not pay the expense of a wife or family unless the wife be also accept for full time peace corp work on the same project there should be no draft exemption because of peace corp service in most case service in the corp will probably be consider a grind for temporary deferment peace corp volunteer obviously should not be pay what they might earn in comparable activity in the unite state nor would it be possible in many case for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterpart abroad be pay the guide principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual service rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance peace corp volunteer should be give just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of live they should live in modest circumstance avoid all conspicuous consumption wherever possible they should live with their host country counterpart some special health requirement might have to be meet for example it probably will be necessary for the corp to have authority to pay medical expense of volunteer perhaps exist public health service state department and armed service medical facility can be utilize for readjustment to the u s volunteer should be give some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service base on the length of time serve in what part of the government should the peace corp be establish the idea of a peace corp have capture the imagination of a great many people support for it cut across party regional ethnic and other line the peace corp therefore offer an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world an opportunity for the american people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development for this the peace corp should be administer by a small new alive agency operate a one component in our whole overseas operation pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the peace corp should be establish a an agency in the department of state when the aid operation be reorganize the peace corp should remain a semi autonomous functional unit meanwhile the peace corp could be physically locate in ica s facility and depend on the state department and ica for administrative support and when need program assistance in this way the peace corp can be launch with it own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for unite state foreign policy and our overseas operation how and when should the peace corp be launch the peace corp can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory work undertake between now and when congress finally appropriate special fund for it or it can be launch now and in earnest by executive action with sufficient fund and make available from exist mutual security appropriation to permit a number of substantial project to start this summer the peace corp should be launch soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualify people from this year s graduate class will not be lose nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for train on university campus if launch in a careful but determine way within the next few week the peace corp could have several hundred person in train this summer for placement next fall within a year or two several thousand might be in service it can then grow steadily a it prove itself and a the need for it be demonstrate what would the first project be in the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching project the need here be most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualify volunteer in a short period of time be greatest there would however be a variety of other skill medical agricultural engineering which would be call for in the first year through the private agency program and through the provision of technician helper to exist development project the first year s project should also be spread through several country in latin america africa and asia how will the peace corp be receive abroad although the need for outside train manpower exist in every newly develop nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the unite state will vary from country to country a certain skepticism about the come of american be to be expect in many quarter unfriendly political group will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility but there be indication that many develop nation will welcome peace corp volunteer and that if the volunteer be well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friend it be important however that the peace corp be advance not a an arm of the cold war but a a contribution to the world community in present it to other government and to the unite nation we could propose that every nation consider the formation of it own peace corp and that the unite nation sponsor the idea and form an international coordinate committee we should hope that peace corp project will be truly international and that our citizen will find themselves work alongside citizen of the host country and also volunteer from other land in any case our peace corp personnel should be offer a technician helper in development project of the u n and other international agency the peace corp be not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership our aim must be to learn a much a we teach the peace corp offer an opportunity to bring home to the unite state the problem of the world a well a an opportunity to meet urgent host country need for train manpower if present in this spirit the response and the result will be immeasurably well how will it be finance the already appropriate fund within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act be the only immediately available source of finance this summer s pilot program of the peace corp if it be decide to make a small shift which may be require from military aid or special assistance fund in order to carry out the purpose of the mutual security act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign to the world congress should then be ask to give the peace corp a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year specifically congress should consider authorize the peace corp to receive contribution from american business union civic organization and the public at large for this must be the project of the whole american people an advisory council of outstanding public figure with experience in world affair should be form to give the program continue guidance and to afford a focal point for public understand step should also be take to link the food for peace program with the peace corp so that foreign currency accumulate by the sale of u s surplus food under p l can be put to use to pay some of the host country expense of peace corp personnel the extent to which participate body such a u s voluntary agency university international organization and the host country or institution in the host country can and should share the cost of the peace corp program must be fully explore be it worth the cost and the risk no matter how well conceive and efficiently run there probably will be failure these could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad but a the popular response suggest the potentiality of the peace corp be very great it can contribute to the development of critical country and region it can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world with thousand of young american go to work in develop area million of american will become more directly involve in the world than ever before with college and university carry a large part of the program and with student look toward peace corp service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness the letter home the talk late give by return member of the peace corp the influence on the life of those who spend two or three year in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policy toward the world and this be meet the world s need too since what the world most need from this country be well understand of the world the peace corp thus can add a new dimension to america s world policy one for which people here and abroad have long be wait a you say in your state of the union message the problem be tower and unprecedented and the response must be tower and unprecedented a well to the congress of the unite state i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corp a pool of train american men and woman send overseas by the u s government or through private organization and institution to help foreign country meet their urgent need for skilled manpower i have today sign an executive order establish a peace corp on a temporary pilot basis the temporary peace corp will be a source of information and experience to aid u in formulate more effective plan for a permanent organization in addition by start the peace corp now we will be able to begin train young men and woman for overseas duty this summer with the objective of place them in overseas position by late fall this temporary peace corp be be establish under exist authority in the mutual security act and will be locate in the department of state it initial expense will be pay from appropriation currently available for our foreign aid program throughout the world the people of the newly develop nation be struggle for economic and social progress which reflect their deep desire our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build grow and independent nation where men can live in dignity liberate from the bond of hunger ignorance and poverty one of the greatest obstacle to the achievement of this goal be the lack of train men and woman with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development project men and woman with the capacity to cope with the demand of swiftly evolve economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the village the mountain the town and the factory of dozen of struggle nation the vast task of economic development urgently require skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the school construct development project demonstrate modern method of sanitation in the village and perform a hundred other task call for train and advance knowledge to meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we be propose the establishment of a peace corp an organization which will recruit and train american volunteer send them abroad to work with the people of other nation this organization will differ from exist assistance program in that it member will supplement technical adviser by offer the specific skill need by develop nation if they be to put technical advice to work they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development project plan by the host government act at a work level and serve at great personal sacrifice there be little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far great than our capacity to absorb them
ch20,ch20,informative,government,2406,wildlife habitat resource in one quarter of the million recreation visit to the national forest and grassland be for the primary purpose of hunt and fishing hunter and fisherman visit since have increase time fast than the nationwide sale of hunt and fishing license this use be expect to increase to about million visit by the long range objective of habitat management be to make it fully productive so a to support fish and game population to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment the wildlife habitat management proposal for the year period be revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plan for all administrative unit assure proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resource inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resource in cooperation with other federal agency and with the state in which national forest and grassland be locate a a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination program include a big game gamebird and small game habitat survey and investigation on the million acre of national forest and grassland b fishery habitat survey and investigation on the mile of national forest fishing stream and nearly million acre of lake and impoundment and c participation in plan inspection and control phase of all habitat improvement land and water use project conduct on national forest land by state other federal agency and private group to assure that project will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource value improve food and cover on million acre of key wildlife area develop wildlife opening food patch and game way in dense vegetation by clear or control burn on acre improve mile of fishing stream and acre of lake by stabilize bank plant streamside cover and construct channel improvement protection the total adverse impact of disease insect fire weather destructive animal and other force on the us and value of forest resource be not generally recognize they kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage value and disrupt us the loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agency in the unite state in be estimate to be about billion board foot if it be not for the effect of destructive agency sawtimber growth would have be nearly twice a great a the billion board foot in about percent of the loss in growth be attributable to disease percent to insect percent to fire and percent to weather animal and various other cause these destructive force also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watershed and their life support waterflows and upon the other renewable forest resource the long range objective be to hold the damage from destructive agency below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principle of multiple use and high level sustain yield of product and service this can be accomplish substantially by a continue trend toward well facility and technique for fire control and more resource to cope with critical fire period and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestation in addition to direct protection measure more intensive management of timber resource will assist in reduction of loss from insect and disease protection from insect and disease in the year period it be propose that insect and disease control on the national forest system be step up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestation that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestation toward the end of the initial period this will require about a percent increase over the present level of protection the work will consist of intensification of present activity through a quicker more extensive and more thorough survey to detect incipient outbreak b more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreak to cause widespread damage c quicker and more effective control action in the initial stage to prevent a large scale epidemic the initial suppression activity would cover about twice the acreage currently be treat continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to acre not now protect but which should be manage for white pine production the objective be to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acre so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be need initiate a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acre of select well stand of young softwood sawtimber on well grow sit coordination of pest control objective with timber management activity to reduce loss protection from fire it be propose that in year all commercial timberland all critical watershed and other land in the national forest system develop or propose for intensive use will be give protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst year and under serious peak load this will include million acre compare with million acre now receive such protection an additional million acre will be give a less degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation meet these level of protection from fire call for expansion modernization and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent a many fire a possible and suppress fire before they spread beyond permit standard this be to be accomplish by nearly double the present level of preventive effort detection skilled fire fight crew and equipment use this will include a step up program of train and development of personnel adoption and use of new and modern technique be develop for prevention for suppression of fire while small and for stop large fire while run and burn intensely reduction of hazardous fuel condition to minimize the chance of large fire develop and spread to high value area this work will cover the most serious one fourth of all land need such treatment and will consist of burn acre of highly hazardous debris concentration fell snag on acre of high lightning occurrence area prescribe burn on million acre remove roadside fuel on acre and clear and maintain mile of firebreak protection from other damage rodent control work for the year period will be aim at control of the most serious infestation of harmful rodent such a porcupine and mouse on high value area of forage and commercial timberland these area comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forest approximately million acre of rangeland and million acre of timberland would be treat in this period control would be limit to those rodent for which economical mean of control be know road and trail the transportation system which serve the national forest be a complex of highway and access road and trail under various ownership and jurisdiction this system be divide into a forest highway system administer by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administer by the secretary of agriculture both of these system be essential for the production development and use of the national forest in the forest highway system there be now mile of public road these be mostly through highway that carry traffic go from one destination to another because administration of the forest highway system be a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provide by the state and county this development program for the national forest do not include estimate of the fund need to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the addition to it that be need it be estimate that about mile of forest highway will eventually be need to fully serve the national forest in the forest development road and trail system there be now mile of road and mile of supplemental foot and horse trail these road be largely of less than highway standard and usually carry traffic which be relate to use of the national forest construction and maintenance of this system be a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture it be estimate that about mile of forest development road and mile of trail constitute the system that will eventually be need to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resource of the national forest on a continue basis the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection it will be carefully plan to maintain optimum service to these important resource and watershed the presence or lack of access by road or trail have a direct and control influence on all phase of forest management and utilization such a a the protection of forage timber and wildlife resource from fire insect and disease b the balance use of recreation hunt and fishing area c the volume of timber that can be market especially for small sale and the support of dependent community and small business enterprise d the level of salvage cut in dead and die timber stand and the opportunity to promptly salvage loss result from fire windstorm insect and disease e the protection of watershed land from erosion and overgrazing by animal the existence of road system permit an intensity of management and use for all national forest purpose that be not otherwise possible furthermore road that give access to national forest timber be investment which pay their own way over a period of year use of these road by the public result in substantial benefit to the locality the road serve the long range objective of this department be to provide and maintain a system of forest development road and trail which will adequately service the national forest system at the level need to meet expect need and optimum production of product and service for the year this mean service a the protection requirement of a watershed produce at least million acre foot of water each year b recreation and wildlife resource use each year by million visitor c a timber resource support an annual cut of billion board foot and d million acre of rangeland service at these level of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about mile of new road and mile of new trail along with the reconstruction to high standard of about mile of road and mile of trail about mile of exist trail will be replace in service by the construction of new road about percent of these long range requirement should be meet by the year program proposal for forest development road and trail for the year period be a follow complete the construction and reconstruction of about mile of multiple purpose road and mile of trail this constitute about percent of the long range requirement for these facility approximately percent of the value of the work on road for access to timber which be plan for this period will be construct by purchaser of national forest timber but pay for by the government through adjustment of stumpage price provide maintenance to full standard on the mile of exist access road and trail and on the new road and trail construct during the period land adjustment land purchase land use within the unit in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership be quite irregular in some unit national forest ownership be well block together in many others the previous patent of land under the public land law or the way in which land be available for purchase result in a scatter pattern of ownership within exterior boundary of national forest and national grassland there be about acre in non federal ownership one consequence be the occurrence of occasional conflict because private owner of some inholdings object to public program of use on neighbor national forest or other federal land or because such ownership be develop for us that be not compatible with use for the public of neighbor national forest land some privately hold inholdings be a source of direct damage to these federal land and some which be suitable for tree grow and for other national forest purpose be unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and be contribute nothing to the economy there be no reasonable prospect that these condition will be correct or change land in this last category be situate largely in the mountainous portion of the eastern state the long range objective be to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tract for recognize national forest program such a recreation development or which be a source of damage to land in national forest and national grassland
ch21,ch21,informative,government,2296,strategy and tactic of the u s military force be now undergo one of the greatest transition in history the change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be make with care mindful that the one type of warfare can not be safely neglect in favor of the other our military force must be capable of contend successfully with any contingency which may be force upon u from limit emergency to all out nuclear general war force and military personnel strength this budget will provide in the fiscal year for the continue support of our force at approximately the present level a year end strength of men and woman in the active force the force to be support include an army of division and men a navy of active ship and men a marine corp of division and air wing with men and an air force of combat wing and men if the reserve component be to serve effectively in time of war their basic organization and objective must conform to the change character and mission of the active force quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere number under modern condition this be especially true of the ready reserve i have request the secretary of defense to reexamine the role and mission of the reserve component in relation to those of the active force and in the light of the change requirement of modern warfare last year the congress discontinue it previously impose minimum personnel strength limitation on the army reserve similar restriction on the strength of the army national guard contain in the department of defense appropriation act should likewise be drop i strongly recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floor on the size of the reserve component so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustment in keep with military necessity i again propose a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve from their present strength of and respectively to and by the end of the fiscal year these strength be consider adequate to meet the essential role and mission of the reserve in support of our national security objective military personnel cost about of the expenditure for the department of defense in be for military personnel cost include pay for active reserve and retire military personnel these expenditure be estimate to be billion an increase of million over reflect additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependent an increase number of men draw proficiency pay and social security tax increase effective for the full year in compare with only month in retire pay cost be increase by million in over partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retire personnel these increase cost be partially offset by a decrease of million in expenditure for the reserve force largely because of the plan reduction in strength of the army reserve component during traditionally rat of pay for retire military personnel have be proportionate to current rat of pay for active personnel the military pay act depart from this establish formula by provide for a increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retire prior to it effective date of june i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retire and active duty pay rat operation and maintenance expenditure for operate and maintain the station and equipment of the armed force be estimate to be billion in which be million more than in the increase stem largely from the grow complexity of and high degree of maintenance require for new weapon and equipment a substantial increase be estimate in the cost of operate additional communication system in the air defense program a well a in all program where speed and security of communication be essential also the program for fleet modernization will be step up in cause an increase in expenditure far increase arise from the civilian employee health program enact by the congress last year other factor increase operate cost include the high unit cost of each fly hour up in two year and of each steam hour up in total these increase in operate cost outweigh the save that result from decline program and from economy measure such a reduce number of unit and installation small inventory of major equipment and improvement in the supply and distribution system of the armed force in the budget message for and again for i recommend immediate repeal of section of the act of september stat this section prevent the military department and the office of civil and defense mobilization from carry out certain transaction involve real property unless they come into agreement with the committee on armed service of the senate and the house of representative a i have state previously the attorney general have advise me that this section violate fundamental constitutional principle accordingly if it be not repeal by the congress at it present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determine otherwise basic long line communication in alaska be now provide through federal facility operate by the army air force and federal aviation agency the grow communication need of this new state can best be meet a they have in other state through the operation and development of such facility by private enterprise legislation have already be propose to authorize the sale of these government own system in alaska and it early enactment be desirable procurement research and construction approximately of the expenditure for the department of defense be for procurement research development and construction program in these expenditure be estimate at billion compare to billion in the decrease which be largely in construction and in aircraft procurement be offset in part by increase for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such a tank vehicle gun and electronic device expenditure for shipbuilding be estimate at about the same level a in new obligational authority for recommend in this budget for aircraft procurement exclude amount for relate research and construction total million which be million below that enact for on the other hand the new authority of million propose for missile procurement exclude research and construction in be million high than for these contrast trend in procurement reflect the anticipate change in the composition and mission of our armed force in the year ahead the department of defense appropriation act for the past several year have contain a rider which limit competitive bid by firm in other country on certain military supply item a i have repeatedly state this provision be much more restrictive than the general law popularly know a the buy american act i urge once again that the congress not reenact this rider the task of provide a reasonable level of military strength without endanger other vital aspect of our security be greatly complicate by the swift pace of scientific progress the last few year have witness what have be perhaps the most rapid advance in military technology in history some weapon system have become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under development furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break through on any one weapon system in itself often diminish the relative importance of other competitive system this have necessitate a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resource to the new and more important weapon system and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapon system which have be overtake by event thus in the last few year a number of program which look very promise at the time their development be commence have since be completely eliminate for example the importance of the regulus a very promise aerodynamic ship to surface missile design to be launch by surface submarine be greatly diminish by the successful acceleration of the much more advance polaris ballistic missile launch by submerge submarine another example be the recent cancellation of the f a long range interceptor with a speed three time a great a the speed of sound which be design for use against man bomber in the period of the mid s the substantial progress be make in ballistic missile technology be rapidly shift the main threat from man bomber to missile consider the high cost of the f system over billion for the force that have be plan and the time period in which it would become operational it be decide to stop far work on the project meanwhile other air defense force be be make effective a describe late in this message the size and scope of other important program have be reduce from early plan notable in this category be the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic missile which have be successfully develop produce and deploy but the relative importance of which have diminish with the increase availability of the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile the impact of technological factor be also illustrate by the history of the high energy fuel program this project be start at a time when there be a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft particularly our heavy bomber continue technical problem involve in the use of this fuel couple with significant improvement in aircraft range through other mean have now raise serious question about the value of the high energy fuel program a a result the scope of this project have be sharply curtail these example underscore the importance of even more search evaluation of new major development program and even more penetrate and far range analysis of the potentiality of future technology the cost of develop a major weapon system be now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercise in select new system for development in determine the most satisfactory rate of development and in decide the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it strategic force the deterrent power of our armed force come from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operation in any form of war the first capability be represent by a combination of man bomber carrier base aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate range missile the second capability be represent by our deploy grind naval and air force in essential forward area together with ready reserve capable of effect early emergency reinforcement the strategic air command be the principal element of our long range nuclear capability one of the important and difficult decision which have to be make in this budget concern the role of the b a long range supersonic bomber this aircraft which be plan for initial operational use about would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile system all of which be schedule to become available early the first atlas icbm s be now operational the first two polaris submarine be expect to be operational this calendar year and the first titan icbm s next year the minuteman solid fuel icbm be plan to be operational about mid by several or all of these system will have be fully test and their reliability establish thus the need for the b a a strategic weapon system be doubtful however i be recommend that development work on the b air frame and engine be continue it be expect that in two prototype aircraft will be available for flight test by that time we should be in a much well position to determine the value of that aircraft a a weapon system i be recommend additional acquisition of the improve version of the b the b h with the new turbofan engine and procurement of the b supersonic medium bomber together with the support refuel tanker in each case these additional modern bomber will replace some of the old b medium bomber one b can do the work of several b s which it will replace fund be also include in this budget to continue the equip of the b wing with the hound dog air to surface missile in the come fiscal year additional quantity of atlas titan and polaris missile also will be procure

ch23,ch23,informative,government,2282,this broad delegation leave within our discretion subject to the always present criterion of the public interest both the determination of what degree of interference shall be consider excessive and the method by which such excessive interference shall be avoid the present proceed be concern with the standard broadcast be band from kc to kc whenever two or more standard broadcast station operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequency each interfere to some extent with reception of the other the extent of such interference which may be so slight a to be undetectable at any point where either of the station render a usable signal or may be so great a to virtually destroy the service area of both station depend on many factor among the principal one be the distance between the station their respective radiate power and of particular significance here the time of day other factor play a part in the extent of be service and interference be the frequency involve the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle grind conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others with the existence of these many factor some of them variable it obviously have never be and be not now possible for the commission to make assignment of be station on a case to case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstance rather such assignment be make a they must be on the basis of certain overall rule and standard represent to some extent a statistical approach to the problem take into account for each situation some of the variable e g power and station separation and average out others in order to achieve the balance which must be strike between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of station large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation an example of the overall standard apply be the to ratio establish for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which be regard a objectionable by this standard it be determine that where two station operate on the same frequency be involve objectionable interference from station a exist at any point within the service area of station b where station a s signal be of an intensity one twentieth or more of the strength of station b s signal at that point the to ratio for cochannel interference embody one of the fundamental limit principle which we must always take into account in be assignment and allocation that signal from a particular station be potential source of objectionable interference over an area much great than that within which they provide useful service a second fundamental principle be that involve particularly in the present proceed the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation condition with respect to the standard broadcast frequency this be a phenomenon familiar to all radio listener result from reflection of skywave signal at night from the ionize layer in the upper atmosphere know a the ionosphere all be station radiate both skywave and groundwave signal at all hour but during the middle daytime hour these skywave radiation be not reflect in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference be in general negligible but during nighttime hour the skywave radiation be reflect from the ionosphere thereby create the possibility of one station s render service via skywave at a much great distance than it can through it groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicate the interference problem because of the still great distance over which these skywave signal may cause interference to the signal of station on the same and closely adjacent frequency because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation condition it have be necessary to evolve different allocation structure for daytime and nighttime broadcast in the be band with many more station operate during the day than at night it be recognize year ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation condition and vice versa be not an instantaneous process but take place over period of time from roughly hour before sunset until about hour after sunset and again from roughly hour before sunrise until some hour after sunrise during the period of about hour around sunset skywave transmission condition be build up until full nighttime condition prevail during the same period around sunrise skywave transmission be decline until at about hour after sunrise it reach a point where it become of little practical significance however in this case a elsewhere it be necessary to arrive at a single standard to be apply to all situation represent an average of condition and thus to fix particular point in time which would be consider the divide point between daytime and nighttime condition it be determine that the hour of sunrise and sunset respectively should be use for this purpose accordingly the rule adopt these hour a limitation upon the operation of daytime station class station operate on clear channel be require to cease operation or operate under nighttime restriction begin either at local sunset for daytime class station or sunset at the location of the dominant class station where locate west of the class station for limit time class station the same restriction apply after local sunset in the case of class station operate on regional channel which after that time be require to operate under nighttime restriction in order to protect each other with respect to nighttime assignment the degree of skywave service and interference be determine by skywave curve fig and of sec of the rule give average skywave value these curve be derive by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data it be recognize that skywave signal because of their reflect nature be of great variability and subject to wide fluctuation in strength for this reason the more uncertain skywave service be denominate secondary in our rule a compare to the steady more reliable groundwave primary service and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength be express in term of percentage of time a particular signal intensity level be exceed percent of the time for skywave service percent of the time for skywave interference allocation policy a mention the allocation of be station represent a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of station the rule and policy to be apply in this process of course must be base on objective which represent what be to be desire if radio service be to be of maximum use to the nation our objective a we have state many time be to provide some service to all listener to provide a many choice of service to a many listener a possible to provide service of local origin to a many listener a possible since broadcast frequency be very limit in number these objective be to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realize and to the extent that each be realize there be a correspond reduction of the possibility for full achievement of the others accordingly the commission have recognize that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency do not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequency and have assign different frequency for use by different class of station some frequency be assign for use primarily by dominant class a or class b clear channel station design to operate with adequate power and to provide service both groundwave and at night skywave over large area and at great distance be protect against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective in deal with these frequency the objective list first above provision of service to all listener be predominant the other objective be subordinate to it the class station on these clear channel be protect to their mv m groundwave contour against daytime cochannel interference with respect to skywave service render at night class a station be the only station permit to operate in the unite state on clear channel specify for class a operation and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be receive class b station be protect at night to their mv m percent time skywave contour against cochannel interference since the provision of skywave service require adequate freedom from interference only class station be capable of render skywave service but nighttime operation by station of other class of course entail skywave interference to groundwave service interference which be substantial unless step be take to minimize it with respect to other frequency these be designate a regional or local and assign for use by class and class station respectively station operate generally with lower power in the allocation pattern work out for these frequency the provision of long range service have to some extent be subordinate to the other two objective assignment of multiple facility and assignment of station in a many community a possible a mention the primary allocation objective to be follow in the allocation of station on clear channel be the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference during nighttime hour because of the intense skywave propagation then prevail no large number of station can be permit to operate on one of these channel if the wide area service for which these frequency be assign be to be render satisfactorily by the dominant station which must be rely upon to render it therefore under our longstanding allocation rule on some of these channel no station other than the dominant class a station be permit to operate at night so that the a station can render service interference free wherever it can be receive on the remainder of the clear channel the dominant class b station be protect a describe above and the relatively small number of secondary class station permit to operate on these channel at night be require to operate directionally and or with reduce power so a to protect the class station in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission be relatively inefficient it be possible to assign a substantially large number of station on these channel additional class assignment for daytime operation can be make without cause destructive interference to the class station or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channel and additional local outlet for a large number of community such additional daytime class assignment be appropriate if optimum use be to be make of these frequency and the commission have over the year make a large number of them similarly on the regional channel many class station have be assign either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antenna and or lower power essentially the question present for decision in the present daytime skywave proceed be whether our decision in to assign station on the basis of daytime condition from sunrise to sunset be sound a a basis for be allocation or whether in the light of late development and new understand skywave transmission be of such significance during the hour immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be take into account and some station require to afford protection to other station during these hour the history of the proceed the decision reach in be make after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof since then there have be a notable increase in the number of station and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new technique for use it lead to a well understand of propagation phenomenon in affidavit be file with the commission by various clear channel station allege that extensive interference be be cause to the service area of these station during daylight hour from class station whose signal be be reflect from the ionosphere so a to create skywave intereference

of extinction forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit a the roman poet virgil declare with much more historical sense than most writer of today it give indeed cause for rejoice to remember what many catastrophe of the past produce and it be to be note also that confidence should grow from remember that great men often appear in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind for example out of the social evil of the english industrial revolution come the novel of charles dickens and his genius move his reader to seek solution of those evil for all western men until today in the industrialize west these social evil substantially do not exist the solution be not arrive at by any theoretician of the karl marx stripe but by men of government lawyer most of them and men of business these be educate men who a mr justice holmes be fond of say form their induction out of experience under the burden of responsibility that be to put it realistically they have to run their business at a profit or they have to get the vote to get elect nevertheless they make naught of marx s prophecy that capitalism would never pay the worker to use marx s word more than a subsistence wage with the consequence that increase productivity must inevitably find it way into the capitalist pocket with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase but a all understand who have eye to see nothing of the kind have happen indeed the contrary have happen the gulf between the rich and the poor have narrow in the industrialize western world to the point that the word poor be hardly applicable and the reason this could happen be clear men of government business men lawyer and all who concern themselves with the welfare of their fellow men do not let their concern to run their business at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity some would say that they be not permit to run their business only for profit and even put it that way would not prove that marx be anything but wrong sir henry sumner maine a hundred year before communism be a force to be reckon with write his brilliant legal generalization that the progress of society be from status to contract the essence of contract be that one be free to make a choice of what one will or will not do hence the condition of freedom be a necessary condition for choice the great the range of freedom for individual men the great the range of choice the great the range of choice the great the rate of change for change be dependent on the possibility that individual men glimpse for the future but when there be not freedom and opportunity to choose men individual men must remain in status and society do not can not progress the eternal truth be that progress due a it always be to individual creative genius be just a dependent on freedom a human life be dependent on the beat of the heart and lest anybody think that consideration such a these be not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten them with the truth that under communism there would have be no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellow might proceed untrammeled in every way toward their discovery their creative effort for the good of mankind during the year we grant fellowship in we grant a heretofore our fellowship be available to assist research in all field of knowledge and creative effort in all the art we do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic creation be good provide only that it contribute to a sense and understand of the true end of life a all first rate scholarship and artistic creation do indeed if press we would say what the late robert henri american painter say to a pupil anything will do for a subject it s what you do with it that count thus we have no part and want none in current discussion of the relative importance of science the social study the humanity the creative art we want no part in such discussion because we think them largely futile and we think them largely futile because for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every artist must cross boundary of knowledge and boundary of point of view
ch26,ch26,informative,government,2200,when the brown sharpe manufacture company reach it th year a a go industrial concern during it become an almost unique institution in the mechanical world with it history stand astride all but the very beginning of the industrial revolution brown sharpe have become over the year a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of it founder joseph r brown and a world renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology joseph r brown grow up in the bustle and enterprise of new england between and he be early expose to the mechanical world and in his youth often help his father david brown master clock and watchmaker a he ply his trade at the age of he become an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott harris in valley fall rhode island and follow two or three other job in quick succession after graduation he go into business for himself in make lathe and small tool this enterprise lead to a father and son combination begin in under the name d brown son a business which eventually grow into the modern corporation we now call brown sharpe the year of joseph s partnership with his father be number in a devastate fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter david brown move west to illinois settle on a land grant in his decline year joseph brown continue in business by himself quickly rebuilding the establishment which have be lose in the fire and begin those first step which be to establish him a a pioneer in raise the standard of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world much of his genius of course spring from his familiarity with clock movement during these early year the repair of watch and clock and the build of special clock for church steeple form an important part of the young man s occupation he become particularly interest in graduate and precision measurement during the s and his think along these line develop considerably during this period but his business also grow and we be tell that mr brown find it increasingly difficult to devote a much time to his creative think a his inclination lead him to desire it must have be with some pleasure and relief that on september joseph brown make the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically cryptic style lucian sharpe come to work for me this day a an apprentice the young apprentice apparently do well by mr brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship lucian be offer a full partnership in the firm the company become j r brown sharpe and enter into a new and important period of it development mr sharpe s arrival in the business do indeed provide what mr brown have most covet time for tinker and the opportunity of carry out in the back room those development in precision graduation which most interest him at that time by the new partnership announce the precision vernier caliper a the first fruit of their joint effort the basic significance of this invention help them to follow it rapidly in by the development of a unique precision gear cut and divide engine that development in turn form the foundation of still more significant expansion in late year in gear cut in circular graduate in index drill and in many other field where accuracy be a paramount requirement throughout their career both mr brown and mr sharpe be interest in the problem of set up standard of measurement for the mechanical trade several effort be make in this direction and though not all of them survive to this day the brown sharpe wire gage system be eventually adopt a the american standard and be still in common use today a one development follow another the company s reputation for precision in the graduate field bring it broad and broad opportunity for expansion in precision manufacture in the partnership begin manufacture the willcox gibbs sewing machine a the story go mr gibbs who originally come from the back county of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous howe sewing machine curious a to what make it work he build a crude model of it in wood and file a piece of steel until he succeed in make a metal pickup for the thread enable the crude machine to take stitch when he show this model a his solution a to how the howe sewing machine operate he be tell he be wrong and discover to his amazement that the howe machine which be unknown to him in detail use two thread while the one that he have perfect use only one thus be invent the single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with mr willcox decide to bring to brown sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake it manufacture the new work be a boon to the partnership not only for it own value but particularly for the stimulation it provide to the imagination of j r brown toward yet far development for production equipment the turret screw machine now know a the brown sharpe hand screw machine take it ancestry directly from mr brown s effort to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine mr brown make important addition to the art in screw machine design by drastically improve the mean for revolve the turret by introduce automatic feed device for the stock and reversible tap and die holder in mr brown s attention be call to yet another basic production problem the manufacture of twist drill at that time during the civil war union musket be be manufacture in providence and the drill to drill them be be hand file with rattail file this process neither satisfy the urgent production schedule nor mr brown s imagination of the possibility in the situation the child of this problem be mr brown s famous serial no universal mill machine the archtype from which be descend today s universal knee type mill machine use throughout the world the original machine bear it famous serial number be still on exhibition at the brown sharpe precision center in providence during the civil war period mr brown also invent the brown sharpe form tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionize the world s gear manufacture industry by change it basic economics up until that time it have be possible to make cutter for make gear teeth but they be good for only one sharpen a soon a the time come for re sharpen the precise form of the gear tooth be lose and a new cutter have to be make this process make the economical manufacture of gear questionable until some way could be find to permit the repeat re sharpen of gear tooth cutter without the loss of the precision form mr brown s invention achieve this and a a byproduct form the cornerstone of brown sharpe s position of leadership in the gear make equipment field which last until the s when supercede by other method the micrometer caliper a a common workshop tool also owe much to j r brown although mr brown be not himself it inventor it be a french idea it be typical that his intuition first conceive the importance of mass produce this basic tool for general use so it be that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool on exhibition in paris in they bring a sample with them to the unite state and start brown sharpe in yet another field where it retain it leadership to this day the final achievement of mr brown s long and interest mechanical career run a close second in importance to his development of the universal mill machine that achievement be his creation of the universal grind machine which make it appearance in at the philadelphia centennial exposition this machine like it mill counterpart be the antecedent of a machine family use to this very day in precision metalworking shop throughout the world along with j r brown s other major development the universal grind machine be profoundly influential in set the course of brown sharpe for many year to come follow mr brown s death there come forward in the brown sharpe organization many other men who contribute greatly to the development of the company one such man be samuel darling a head of the firm darling swartz mr darling begin by challenge brown sharpe to it keenest competition during the s and early s in however a truce be call between the company and the partnership of darling brown sharpe be form between that year and the buy out of mr darling s interest in a large portion of the company s precision tool business be carry out under the name of darling brown sharpe and to this day many old precision tool be in use still bear that famous trademark perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of mr brown s tradition for accuracy be mr oscar j beale whose mechanical genius closely parallel that of mr brown and whose particular forte be the development of the exceedingly accurate measure machinery that enable brown sharpe to manufacture gag and therefore it product with an accuracy exceed anything then available elsewhere in the world also important on the brown sharpe scene at the turn of the century be mr richmond viall work superintendent of the company from to mr viall possess remarkable talent for the leadership and development of men he be an ardent champion of the brown sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able men who first develop their industrial talent with the company in one sense it can be say that one of the most important brown sharpe product over the year have be the men who begin work with the company and subsequently come to place of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad commence with the death of lucian sharpe in the name of henry d sharpe be for more than year closely interweave with the destiny of the company during his presidency the company s physical plant be enormously expand and the length and breadth of the brown sharpe machine tool line become the greatest in the world during the early part of this century the brown sharpe work in providence be unchallenged a the large single manufacture facility devote exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world during these year the company s product line follow the basic tenet lay down by mr brown it expand from hand screw machine to automatic screw machine from simple form tooth gear cut machine to gear hob machine and a large contract gear manufacture business from rudimentary belt drive universal mill machine to a broad line of elaborately control knee type and manufacture type mill machine in the grind machine field expansion go far from universal grinder alone and take in cylindrical grinder surface grinder and a wide variety of special and semi special model in henry d sharpe jr succeed his father and continue the company s development a a major factor in the metal work equipment business the company be still broaden it line and be now active on four major front the machine tool division be currently produce brown sharpe single spindle automatic screw machine grind machine of many type and knee and bed type mill machine recently add be the brown sharpe turret drill machine which introduce the company to an entirely new field of tool development in the industrial product division the company manufacture and market a wide line of precision gag and inspection equipment machinist tool include micrometer vernier caliper and accessory in the cut tool division the principal product include a wide variety of high speed steel mill cutter end mill and saw
ch27,ch27,informative,government,2248,sale and net income for the year end december show an improvement over net income be or per share on common share currently outstanding a compare to or per share in adjust to the same number of share sale and other operate income increase from in to in this increase be sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of high cost of manufacture and increase expenditure on research and development in spite of the fact that our large market the textile industry be affect substantially by the current decline in business activity we have be able to produce and deliver our machine throughout the year at a rate materially high than during outlook for current year our current rate of incoming order have now contract and unless this trend can be reverse our production for will be lower than for however the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lend support to the broadly express belief that improvement in that industry can be expect by the second half of need for sound tax policy in connection with our continue development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sound u s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enable the mill to charge off the cost of new machine on a more realistic basis could if adopt have favorable effect on leesona s business in the next few year such a depreciation policy would also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthen the competitive position of the u s textile and other industry thus help to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange research and development our research and development program serve a it do an industry which must compete against low cost production throughout the world continue to have primary emphasis at leesona this program be base on the policy of design and build efficient machine which will help produce well textile value fabric whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with well textile product for the money such policy involve continue effort to improve on exist mill equipment in term of efficiency and versatility but more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concept in textile process a do the unifil loom winder and our more recent uniconer automatic con machine budget increase on this basis our already substantial budget for research and development have be far increase in recent year in order to finance the continue engineering and design work essential to leesona s future growth in sale and earnings much of this necessary increase in research and development though properly chargeable to current expense be not reflect in earnings until project be complete and the new machine sell in quantity usually over a period of several year stretch yarn machine in december we begin to ship our ultra high speed stretch yarn machine these machine produce the high quality stretch yarn require in weave stretch and textured fabric during the past year great progress have be make by the weave mill in create new stretch and textured fabric fashion center be now predict broad acceptance of sport apparel and improve wash and wear dress and blouse make from these fabric this machine operate at speed up to revolution per minute be believe to provide one of the fast mechanical operation in industry today it transfer yarn directly from the producer large package into ideal supply package for use on unifil loom winder in weave stretch yarn fabric large package twister our new large package ring twister for glass fiber yarn be perform well in our customer mill late in the year additional type of this leesona twister will be make available to mill for other man make fiber and natural yarn these machine be design to provide high operate speed large yarn package and great flexibility of application to different type of yarn this we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment uniconer major activity at providence in will involve the schedule completion of tool for production of the uniconer automatic con machine this work be progress on schedule and we expect to make initial shipment in the fourth quarter of this year this machine be demonstrate in two textile machinery exhibition last year and be well receive by the industry the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder the uniconer have several outstanding feature it operate with much great efficiency than exist equipment it incorporate an automatic knot tie device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in second a well a tie in new bobbin a the run end be exhaust because the bobbin to cone wind process be a relatively high cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provide by the uniconer can mean important economy in textile production at the same time upgrade quality many mill have already place firm order for this machine new unifil application a new application for the unifil loom winder run single fill for box loom will broaden mill use of this equipment take up machine a new spin take up machine have be develop to facilitate the use of our take up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarn it be equip with electronic control that can be set to hold precise tension and speed this new machine take up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and wind large package at speed up to foot per minute it be equip with an automatic thread device to reduce waste and handle time our take up machine and our twister coners be undergo important pilot plant test for application with new high polymer yarn in several fiber produce plant we look forward to a strong position in this expand field diversification plan we be interest in far diversification into other field of capital good or component for industrial product and have recently intensify our effort in that direction patterson moo research our patterson moo research division have make far very encourage progress in development of fuel cell the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt whitney aircraft division of unite aircraft corporation have be important in this work in addition to it major effort on fuel cell patterson moo research division be continue to carry on research in other field both under contract for the defense department other government agency and for our own account pmr be currently supply component vital to the titan and minuteman program we have recently enter into an agreement with compagnie generale de telegraphie sans fil csf of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric material the agreement give u right for manufacture and market of such material in the unite state initially we will import the thermoelectric material and module from france but late we will manufacture in this country there be a rapidly grow demand for this material primarily from the military far research we believe will develop important commercial application a project for the air force have be complete in which the nair infrared detecting device be develop for area monitor of noxious or dangerous gas we be initiate research on the use of solid state material for infrared detection use a method which will not require cool of material to attain high sensitivity the rapid advance in science today suggest many other avenue of investigation our plan be to keep abreast of these advance and select for development those field which seem most promise for our special capability new plant facility early in august we break grind for a new plant in warwick rhode island which will house our textile and coil wind machinery operation construction be well along and the plant be schedule for completion in november of this year all operation now carry on at our plant at cranston will be transfer to warwick operation in the new plant should be produce efficiently early in an architect s sketch of the new plant be show on the front cover the build will contain square foot approximately the same a our present plant however it modern one story layout be design to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacture and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance cost a major consideration in the choice of the warwick site four mile from cranston be the fact that it permit retention of our present train and highly skilled work force we have enter into an agreement for the sale of the present cranston property effective a soon a we have complete removal to our new plant british subsidiary during the year our british subsidiary leesona holt limit expand it plant in darwen england and add machine tool capacity the operation of it other plant in rochdale and leesona s former operation in manchester be transfer to a recently acquire plant in the adjoin town of heywood layout and equipment be modernize and improve to obtain increase production on an efficient basis the area available at heywood be approximately three time the size of the former rochdale and manchester location in addition land have be purchase to permit double the size of the plant in the future financial development the new warwick plant be be build at our expense and under our direction it will be transfer on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a non profit organization which will reimburse u for the cost of construction we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase these arrangement be in our opinion very favorable to leesona interim finance of construction cost be provide by a short term loan from the chase manhattan bank in addition to expenditure on the warwick plant we have invest approximately for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at leesona holt limit we believe that these improve facility will contribute income and effect save which will fully justify the investment long term loan have be reduce by to inventory increase to during the year and should decline in come month thus we enter in a strong financial position employee contract in accordance with the two year contract sign in may with the international association of machinist afl cio wage of hourly employee be increase by in may and pay level for non exempt salaried employee be increase proportionately in addition blue cross coverage for all employee and their dependent be extend to provide the full cost of semi private hospital accommodation personnel benefit in addition to direct salary and wage the company pay or accrue during the year the follow amount for the benefit of employee during the pension year end december employee retire make a total of currently retire under the company s pension plan at december the fund hold by the industrial national bank of providence a trustee for payment of past and future service pension to qualify member of the plan total the basic market for textile be grow with the expansion of the population that begin year ago another growth factor be increase consumer demand for well quality and large quantity of fabric that go with a rise standard of live a in many other industry rise cost and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exert increase pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent year increase efficiency in textile a elsewhere a major part of the solution lie in great efficiency and high productivity a a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery leesona and other company in it industry have seek to meet this challenge with new or improve equipment and method that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility problem of shift style the problem of efficient production in textile be complicate by the fact that the industry serve large market which shift quickly with change of fashion in apparel or home decoration production must be adjust accordingly at minimum cost and quickly in addition production machinery must in many case be design to handle with equal efficiency both natural fiber and the increase number of synthetic a well a blend

ch29,ch29,informative,government,2225,in recent month much attention have be give to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economist be somewhat divide a to the outlook for the near future and yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade have be a good year in many way with many overall measure of business have reach new peak for the year a a whole the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution have probably be a good thing in that it have prevent the accumulation of the burdensome inventory that have characterize many previous swing in the business cycle this caution have be particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailer and distributor to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stock at retail be low in many line have escape attention because of the presence of high stock at the manufacture level in the electronics industry this tendency be well illustrate by inventory of tv set factory stock in recent month have be the high they have be in three year while those at retail be below the total value of our industry s shipment at factory price increase from billion in to approximately billion a a result of increase in all of the major segment of our business home entertainment military industrial and replacement i believe a far gain be in prospect for home entertainment sale up reflect the large percentage of high end set such a console and combination since dollar value of home entertainment electronics in be about billion compare to billion in sale of tv set at retail run ahead of the like month of through july set production exclude those destine for the export market also run ahead in the early month but be curtail after the usual vacation shutdown in the face of grow evidence that some of the early production plan have be overly optimistic for the year a a whole retail sale of tv set probably come to million against million in however production come to only million compare to million in contrast to the lower turnout of tv total radio production increase from million set to million exclude export both home and auto radio be in excellent demand with retail sale of home set ahead of in every month of the first eleven sale and production of home set be about equal at million unit auto set production come to about million compare to million in separate phonograph also have a good year reflect the grow popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterize the radio tv market the outlook for entertainment electronics in be certainly far from clear at present but recent survey have show a desire on the part of consumer to step up their buy plan for durable good i would expect that sale at retail in the first half of might be below by some but that second half level should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business condition recover a some recent forecast suggest they will i look for tv sale and production to be approximately equal at million set for the year but i look for some decline in radio from the high rate in to more nearly the level of million set i therefore believe it be realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about million slightly below but above military electronics to grow witness another substantial increase in our industry s shipment of military electronics which total about billion compare to billion in it be interest to note that the present level of military electronics procurement be great than the industry s total sale to all market in which be good year for our industry with television enjoy it initial period of rapid consumer acceptance it have be correctly point out by well inform people in the industry that it be probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of or well that characterize the decade of the s and that our military market may be enter upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapon system will give way to concentration of still undeveloped area of our defense capability while this may well be true in general i believe it be also important to keep in mind that some recent development suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly grow area in an economy which be not expand rapidly in other direction among the item schedule for acceleration in the near future be the polaris and b program strengthen of the airborne alert system of the strategic air command and improve battlefield surveillance system research and development expenditure connect with the reconnaissance satellite samos and the future development of ballistic missile defense system such a nike zeus be expect to increase substantially research development test and evaluation fund devote to missile in be to time a large a those devote to aircraft and actual missile procurement be expect to exceed aircraft procurement by still late the realm of space technology will show substantial gain it have be estimate that spend by the national aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than million in fiscal to more than billion by and that the electronic industry s share of these expenditure will be close to than the current the step up defense procurement call for in the budget have already begin to make itself felt in an upturn in order for military electronic equipment and the component that go into it and it have be suggest that an additional billion increase in total defense spend may be request for fiscal although the impact of these increase on our industry s shipment will be gradual on balance i look for another good increase in shipment in the come year to at least billion industrial electronic equipment pace by the continue rapid growth of electronic data process sale of industrial and commercial electronic equipment total billion compare to billion in the market for computer and other data handle continue to expand at the rate of about annually reach some million in inform estimate look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late s under the stimulus of new application in the field of bank and retail industrial process control and information storage and retrieval in the industrial field prospect for high expenditure on electronic test and measure equipment be also quite bright for the near term however it must be realize that the industrial and commercial market be somewhat more sensitive to general business condition than be the military market and for this reason i would expect that any gain in may be somewhat small than those of recent year sale should slightly exceed however and reach billion replacement part in addition to the three major original equipment segment of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement part continue year by year this be now a billion business up from billion in and should reach billion in the market for electronic part in have reflect the change pattern of the various end equipment segment of the industry demand for part for home entertainment be strong in the first half but purchase be cut back to lower level during the fall a set manufacturer reduce their own operate rat in the military field incoming order turn down early in the year and remain rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment begin to make itself felt in rise order for component sale of transistor in exceed million compare to million in despite substantial price reduction in virtually all type production total about million unit against million in and i look for a far gain to million unit worth approximately million in sale of passive component such a capacitor and resistor although not grow a fast a those of semi conductor be ahead of this year and should increase again in in sum i look for another good year for the electronics industry in with total sale increase about to billion despite the uncertainty in the business outlook generally a i have indicate above i base this feel on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable good may continue through the early month of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery late on to bring the full year figure close to those of on prospect for continue increase in defense spend and on continue growth in the

ch30,ch30,informative,government,2214,between meet he help the president keep track of delegate matter since these duty fit neatly with those of the propose presidential aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both job since faculty see themselves a self employ professional rather than a employee enthusiasm in a common enterprise be proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of share in the decision that govern it course the faculty believe that broad autonomy be necessary to preserve it freedom in teaching and scholarship the president expect faculty member to remember in exercise their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the university s income nor be they personally accountable for top level decision he may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he have a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matter to the administration how well do faculty member govern themselves there be little evidence that they be give any systematic think to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government they sometimes pay more attention to their right than to their own internal problem of government they too need to learn to delegate let the administration take detail off their hand would give them more time to inform themselves about education a a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention although faculty insist on govern themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participate in college or university government there be nevertheless several thing that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who be will to exercise their privilege he can for example present significant university wide issue to the senate he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various way by see to it that the membership of each committee represent the thoughtful a well a the action orient faculty by make certain that no faculty member have too many committee assignment by assure good liaison between the committee and the administration by minimize the number of committee despite the many avenue for the exchange of idea between faculty and administration complaint of a lack of communication persist the cause be a often neglect a hesitance to disclose a busy president conversant with a problem and it ramification and beset by pressure to meet deadline tend naturally to assume that others must be a familiar with a problem a he be the need for interchange and understand make vital the full use of all method of consultation to increase faculty influence and decrease tension many president have establish a stand advisory committee with which they can discus problem frankly the president have little influence in day by day curricular change but if he look ahead two three or five year to anticipate issue and throw out challenge idea he can open the way for innovation and he can also have a great deal to say a to what path it will take success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogative patience and persistence the critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff be to assure that the college or university continually rebuild and regenerate itself so that it performance will match change social demand great professor do not automatically reproduce themselves dean can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty they serve not only a spokesman for their area but they also contribute to top level decision make the president who appoint strong men who have an all college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance faculty member depend on their department chairman to promote their interest with the administration the administration at the same time look to the chairman for strategic aid in build strong department one way that this can be do other than by hire new high price professor be by constantly encourage the department member to raise their standard of performance the quality of a president s leadership be measure first by his success in build up the faculty by support the effort of the many faculty member who be work to attain ever high standard the president can encourage faculty leadership indirectly he can best help them by insure that rigorous criterion for appointment and promotion be clearly set forth and adhere to the academic dean should take a direct long term interest in faculty development an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel need plan for the future qualification of those on the job and bright prospect elsewhere for the maintenance of a long term program the department and particularly their chairman be strategic they evaluate and nominate candidate for appointment and promotion to provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigate candidate thoroughly at some college and university a faculty committee review and report to the administration on the qualification of candidate some faculty member and many administrator oppose faculty review group because they either repeat department s action or act pro forma they can be effective however if their member set high standard for candidate and devote substantial time to the work at one university the president cite the faculty review committee a a value partner of the administration in guard and promote the quality of the faculty before the president recommend a candidate to the trustee the administration collect the view of colleague in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere the president or dean read some of his publication to form the true possible evaluation of the quality of his mind no good way to evaluate teaching ability have yet be discover although some institution use inventory sheet for a list of criterion to avoid pass over quiet unaggressive teacher a well a to decide whether others merit promotion review of the right of faculty member to promotion or salary increase should be make periodically whether or not they have be recommend for advancement by their department there be certain aspect of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member propose for tenure to guard against the mistake of make this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man s former achievement no one can be a effective a the president in inspire old men to welcome imaginative new teacher whose philosophy or approach to their specialty be quite different in particular the president may have to summon all his oratorical power to persuade department member to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale on those rare occasion when a faculty member on tenure be not meet the standard of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action a true university like most successful marriage be a unity of diversity without force all component into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan be an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at it high level which a university in contrast to a multiversity should stand for recently college and university have begin to translate their educational philosophy into institution wide goal each year a few more institution be decide such question a shall we require a liberal education build around a humanity core for all undergraduate or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subject in the first instance adequate appropriate read material and library accommodation must be plan in the second more shop laboratory and staff will be require for the president a master plan look ahead five year the maximum reach for sound forecast offer several practical advantage trustee faculty and administration can consider the consequence of decision before they be make instead of afterwards physical plant and equipment can be efficiently develop propose new program can be examine for appropriateness to goal and for present and future financial fitness more than one president have find that a long range plan help him to attract major gift it inspire confidence in his institution s determination to establish goal and to achieve them before decide where it be go however a college or university must know where it be the first step be a comprehensive self study make by faculty by outside consultant or by a combination of the two it should sternly appraise curriculum faculty organization build faculty work load and potential for growth in stature and size implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven some department will attack their new goal enthusiastically others may drag their foot fund may be readily donate for some purpose but not others a plan must therefore be bring up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent plan officer to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decision a number of institution have establish office of institutional research some office have very broad responsibility touch on almost all aspect of a university s instructional program their duty include evaluation of the information collect and preparation of recommendation more often these office be restrict to the gather of empirical data the president s opportunity for influence education reach it high point a he decide which project he will cut back which he will advance by increase allowance or new fund raise effort no matter how high the hop and dream of educator budget make adjust them to the cold reality of dollar and cent when the budget go to trustee for approval it be the president s budget to which his faith and credit be commit it principal feature should be a product of his most consider judgment he can not of course examine each proposal from scratch he review and shape the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aim of the institution budget must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid change in scientific and technological scholarship because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sum of money an institution should choose it field of prominence otherwise it will be head for bankruptcy at worst and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branch of learn in the national interest even the affluent university must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambition to keep up with the jones in all branch support activity business management public relation fund raise offer president one of their best chance to buy freedom for attention to education here the reasonable mastery of the element of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role in the area that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinate will serve the college or university well than close presidential attention the president should find strong subordinate and delegate the wide discretion to them high education can not compete with the salary scale of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attraction to member of the business community that will offset the difference in income just a the entire faculty should know the president s educational philosophy and objective so should non academic officer they will well understand the relationship of their activity to the academic program and they will be able to explain their action to faculty in term of mutual goal a president be frequently besiege to serve in non academic civic and governmental capacity to make speech to lay group and to make numerous ceremonial appearance on and off campus since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be govern by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligation declination and substitution be well receive when he explain why his obligation to his institution preclude his acceptance by share the load of important speech with his colleague the president can develop a cadre of able spokesman who will help to create a public perception of the university a an institution something more than the lengthen shadow of one man
cg01,cg01,informative,lettres,2289,northern liberal be the chief supporter of civil right and of integration they have also lead the nation in the direction of a welfare state and both in their objective of non discrimination and of social progress they have have range against them the southerner who be call bourbon the name presumably derive from the french royal house which never learn and never forget since bourbon whiskey though of kentucky origin be at least a much favor by liberal in the north a by conservative in the south the nature of the opposition between liberal and bourbon be too little understand in the north the race problem have tend to obscure other less emotional issue which may fundamentally be even more divisive it be these other difference between north and south other that be than those which concern discrimination or social welfare which i chiefly discus herein i write about northern liberal from considerable personal experience a southerner marry to a new englander i have live for many year in a connecticut commute town with a high percentage of artist writer publicity men and business executive of egghead taste most of them be democrat and nearly all consider themselves and be view a liberal this be puzzle to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism because it be clear that these democrat who be leave of center be at opposite pole from the liberal jefferson who hold that the best government be the least government yet paradoxically my liberal friend continue to view jefferson a one of their patron saint when i question them a to what they mean by concept like liberty and democracy i find that they fall into two category the simple one who have simply accept the shibboleth of their faith without analysis and the intelligent cynical one who scornfully reply that these thing don t count any more in the world of to day i be naive they say to make use of such word i take this to mean that the intelligent and therefore necessarily cynical liberal consider that the need for a national economy with control that will assure his conception of social justice be so great that individual and local liberty a well a democratic process may have to yield before it this seem like an attitude favor a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which under a president of the same stamp would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court a for state right they have never count in the think of my liberal friend except a irritation of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only a anachronism the american liberal may in the world of to day have a strong case but he present it publicly so enmesh in hypocrisy that it be not an honest one why in the first place call himself a liberal if he be against laissez faire and favor an authoritarian central government with womb to tomb control over everybody if he attach little importance to personal liberty why not make this know to the world and if he be so scornful of the right of state why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support i be concern here however with the northern liberal s attitude toward the south it appear to be one of intense dislike which he make little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friend his assumption seem to be that any such friend be tolerable human must be more liberal than most southerner and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his view time s editor thomas griffith in his book the waist high culture write most of what be different about it the deep south i find myself unsympathetic to this for the liberal i know would be an understatement theirs be no mere lack of sympathy but something close to the passionate hatred that be direct against fascism i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerner live in the north in business circle usually conservative this sort of atmosphere would hardly be find but in our case and neither my wife nor i have extreme view on integration nor be we give to emotional outburst the situation have ruin one or two value friendship and come close to wrecking several more in fact it have cause u to give serious think to move our residence south because it be not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host be tell a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerner who oppose integration be to send in troop and shoot the bastard down account have be publish of northern liberal in the south up against segregationist prejudice especially in state support university where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view but these account do not show that northerner have be subject to embarrassment or provocation by yankee hatred display in social gather from my wife s experience and other source this seem to be rarely encounter in educate circle the strong feel be certainly there but there be a leavening of liberalism among college graduate throughout the south especially among those who study in the north and social relation arise out of business tie impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visit northerner also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problem there be of course many south but for this discussion the most important division be between those who have be reconstruct and those who haven t my definition of this much abuse adjective be that a reconstruct rebel be one who be glad that the north win the war nobody know how many southerner there be in this category i suspect that there be far more unreconstructed one than the north like to believe i never hear of a poll be take on the question no doubt such a thing would be consider unpatriotic prior to i imagine that a majority of southerner would have vote against the confederacy since the supreme court s decision of that year this be more doubtful and if a poll have be take immediately follow the dispatch of troop to little rock i believe the majority would have be for the old south belief in the traditional way of life persist much more in the old state than in the new one probably a large percentage of virginian and south carolinian remain unreconstructed than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and alabama follow along after them old attitude be hold more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont so that a line run down the length of the south mark the upper limit of tidewater would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course important minority enclave the long settle area of state like virginia and south carolina develop the ante bellum culture to it rich flowering and there the memory be more precious and the consciousness of loss the great also we should not even to day discount the fact that a region such a the coastal lowland center on charleston have close tie with england and the west indie than with the north even after independence the social and psychological consequence of this continue to affect the area in certain respect defeat increase the persistent anglophilia of the old south poor where they have once be rich humble where they have be arrogant have no long any hope of share in the leadership of the nation the rebel who would not surrender in spirit draw comfort from the sympathy they felt extend to them by the mother country and no doubt many people in state like the carolina and georgia which be among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly regret the revolt against the crown among bourbon the racial issue may have less to do with their remain unreconstructed than other factor all southerner agree that slavery have to go but many historian maintain that except for northern meddling it would have end in state like virginia year before it do southern resentment have be over the method of it ending the invasion and reconstruction their fear now be of miscegenation and negro political control in many county but apart from racial problem the old unreconstructed south to use the moderate word favor by mr thomas griffith find itself unsympathetic to most of what be different about the civilization of the north and this in effect mean most of modern america it be hard to see how the situation could be otherwise and therein i feel many northerner delude themselves about the south for one thing this be not a subject often discuss or analyze there seem to be almost a conspiracy of silence veil it i suppose the reason be a kind of wishful think don t talk about the final stage of reconstruction and they will take care of themselves or else the north really believe that all southerner except a few quaint old character have come around to realize the error of their past and be now at heart sharer of the american dream like everybody else if the circumstance be face frankly it be not reasonable to expect this to be true the situation of the south since have be unique in the western world regardless of right and wrong a population and an area appropriate to a pre world war great power have be follow conquest rule against their will by a neighbor people and have have impose upon them social and economic control they dislike and the great majority of these people be of anglo saxon or celtic descent this be the only case in modern history of a people of britannic origin submit without continue struggle to what they view a foreign domination the fact be due mainly to international war both hot and cold in every war of the unite state since the civil war the south be more belligerent than the rest of the country so instead of be test of the south s loyalty the spanish war the two world war and the korean war all serve to overcome old grievance and cement reunion and there be no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism have the situation be reverse have for instance england be the enemy in because of issue of concern chiefly to new england there be little doubt that large number of southerner would have happily put on their old confederate uniform to fight a ally of britain it be extraordinary that a people a proud and warlike a southerner should have be a docile a they have the north should thank it star that such have be the case but at the same time it should not draw false inference therefrom the two main charge level against the bourbon by liberal be that they be racist and social reactionary there be much truth in both these charge and not many bourbon deny them whatever their fault they be not hypocrite most of them sincerely believe that the anglo saxon be the best race in the world and that it should remain pure many northeners believe this too but few of them will say so publicly the bourbon economic philosophy moreover be not very different from that of northern conservative but those among the bourbon who remain unreconstructed go much far than this they believe that if the south have be let alone it would have produce a civilization superior to that of modern america a it be they consider that the north be now reap the fruit of excess egalitarianism that in spite of it high standard of live the american way have be prove inferior to the english and scandinavian way although they disapprove of the socialistic feature of the latter the south s antipathy to northern civilization include such charge a poor manner harsh accent lack of appreciation of the art of live like gastronomy and the use of leisure their own easy slow tempo be especially dear to southerner and i have hear many say that they be content to earn a half or a third a much a they could up north because they so much prefer the quiet habit of their home town
cg02,cg02,informative,lettres,2311,in the past the duty of the state a sir henry maine note long ago be only two in number internal order and external security by prevail over other claimant for the loyalty of men the nation state maintain an adequate measure of certainty and order within it territorial border outside those limit it assert a against other state a position of sovereign equality and a against the inferior people of the non western world a position of dominance it become the sole subject of international law a term which it be pertinent to remember be coin by bentham a body of legal principle which by and large be make up of what western nation could do in the world arena that corpus of law be a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth century speak generally it further and still tend to far the interest of the western power the enormous change in world politics have however throw it into confusion so much so that it be safe to say that all international law be now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social condition of the present era beyond the two basic task mention above no attention be pay by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility either internally or externally this be particularly true in the world arena which be an anarchical battleground characterize by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empire that any sort of duty be owe by his nation to other nation would have astonish a nineteenth century statesman his duty be to his sovereign and to his nation and an extension to people beyond the territorial boundary be not to be contemplate thus to cite but one example the pax britannica of the nineteenth century whether with the british navy rule the sea or with the city of london rule world finance be strictly national in motivation however much other nation e g the unite state may have incidentally benefit at the same time all suggestion that some sort of societal responsibility exist for the welfare of the people within the territorial state be strongly resist social darwinism be able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century however in recent decade for what doubtless be multiple reason an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift have occur in both facet of national activity a concept of responsibility be in process of articulation and establishment already firmly implant internally it be a grow factor in external matter a little more than twenty year ago the american people turn an important corner in what have aptly be call a constitutional revolution the basic nature of government be transform from one essentially negative in nature the night watchman state to one with affirmative duty to perform the positive state come into existence for lawyer reflect perhaps their parochial preference there have be a special fascination since then in the role play by the supreme court in that transformation the manner in which it decision alter in the switch in time that save nine president roosevelt s ill star but in effect victorious court pack plan the imprimatur of judicial approval that be finally place upon social legislation of great importance however be the content of those program which have have and be have enormous consequence for the american people labor relation have be transform income security have become a standardize feature of political platform and all the many facet of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom a national consensus of near unanimity exist that these governmental effort be desirable a well a necessary ratify in the republican party victory in the positive state be now evidence by political campaign be wag not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be the general acceptance of the idea of governmental i e societal responsibility for the economic

national unity over fragmentation a third one of at least equal and perhaps even great importance be now be traverse american immersion and involvement in world affair internal national responsibility now a truism need not be document nevertheless it may be helpful to cite one example that of employment for a will be show below it cut across both facet of the new concept thirty year ago while the nation be wallow in economic depression the prevail philosophy of government be to stand aside and allow natural force to operate and cure the distress that guide principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege gun of the new deal less than a score of year late congress enact the employment act of by which the national government assume the responsibility of take action to insure condition of maximum employment hand off the economy be replace by conscious guidance through plan the economic side of the constitutional revolution in the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration come when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress win out over a state s responsibility proposal provision be make for payment for unemployment relief by nation wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those state afflict with manpower surplus the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between and internal national responsibility be a societal response to the impact of the industrial revolution reduce to it simple term it be an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individual to cope with the rigor of the era national responsibility for individual welfare be a concept not limit to the unite state or even to the western nation a measure of it widespread acceptance may be derive from a statement of the international congress of jurist in meet in new delhi under the auspex of the international commission of jurist a body of lawyer from the free world the congress redefine and expand the traditional rule of law to include affirmative governmental duty it be noteworthy that the majority of the delegate to the congress be from the less develop former colonial nation the rule of law historically a principle accord everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal be broaden substantively by make it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare recognize that the rule of law be a dynamic concept which should be employ not only to safeguard the civil and political right of the individual in a free society the congress assert that it also include the responsibility to establish social economic educational and cultural condition under which his legitimate aspiration and dignity may be realize the idea of national responsibility thus have become a common feature of the nation of the non soviet world for well or for bad we all now live in welfare state the organize principle of which be collective responsibility for individual well be whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operate in a nation s external relation be less obvious and more difficult to establish the hypothesis venture here be that it do and that evidence be accumulate validate that proposition the content be not the same however rather than individual security it be the security and continue existence of an ideological group those in the free world that be basic external national responsibility involve a burgeon requirement that the leader of the western nation so guide their decision a to far the viability of other friendly nation if internal responsibility suggest acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility imply adherence to principle of ideological supranationalism reference to two other concept nationalism and sovereignty may help to reveal the contour of the new principle in it beginning the nation state have to struggle to assert itself internally against feudal group and externally against the power and influence of such other claimant for loyalty a the church the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism lead not more than two century ago to the surge of nationalism since the time span of the nation state coincide roughly with the separate existence of the unite state a an independent entity it be perhaps natural for american to think of the nation a representative of the high form of order something permanent and unchanging the concept of nationalism be the political principle that epitomize and glorify the territorial state a the characteristic type of socal structure but it be more than that for it include the emotional tie that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivation that hold a large group of people together a a unit today a new nation rise from the former colonial empire nationalism be one of the hurricane force loose in the world almost febrile in intensity the principle have become worldwide in application unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervor can wreak greatest harm historically however the concept be one that have be of mark benefit to the people of the western civilizational group by subdue disparate less group the nation have to some degree at least broaden the capacity for individual liberty within their confine moreover technological and industrial growth have proceed at an accelerate pace thus increase the cornucopia from which material want can be satisfy while the pattern be uneven some have gain more than others nationalism have in fact serve the western people well whether historical nationalism help the people of the remainder of the world and whether today s nationalism in the former colonial area have equally beneficial aspect be other question it be one of the ironic quirk of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state be rapidly dissipate at precisely the time that the nation state attain it high number approximately but it be more than irony one of the main reason why nationalism be no long a tenable concept be because it have spread throughout the planet in other word nationalism work well enough when it have limit application both a to geography and a to population it become a perilous anachronism when adopt on a world wide basis complement the political principle of nationalism be the legal principle of sovereignty the former receive it legitimacy from the latter operate side by side together they help shore up the nation state while sovereignty have root in antiquity in it present usage it be essentially modern jean bodin write in the sixteenth century may have be the seminal thinker but it be the vastly influential john austin who set out the main line of the concept a now understand austin s nineteenth century view of law and sovereignty still dominate much of today s legal and political think to him law be the command of the sovereign the english monarch who personify the power of the nation while sovereignty be the power to make law i e to prevail over internal group and to be free from the command of other sovereign in other nation these fundamental idea the indivisibility of sovereignty and it dual internal external aspect still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power the nation state then exemplify the principle of nationalism and exercise sovereignty supreme power over domestic affair and independence from outside control in fact however both principle have always be nebulous and loosely define high level abstraction be always difficult to pin down with precision that be particularly true of sovereignty when it be apply to democratic society in which popular sovereignty be say to exist and in federal nation in which the job of government be split nevertheless nationalism and sovereignty be repute in the accept wisdom to describe the modern world be there a different reality behind the facade do the surface hide a quite different picture the short answer to those question be yes both concept be undergo alteration to some degree they be be supplant by a concept of national responsibility a evidence to support that view consider the follow illustrative instance
cg03,cg03,informative,lettres,2403,can thermonuclear war be set off by accident what step have be take to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continent be we a safe a we should be from such a disaster be anything be do to increase our margin of safety will the danger increase or decrease i have just ask these question in the pentagon in the white house in office of key scientist across the country and aboard the submarine that prowl for month underwater with neat row of green launch tube which contain polaris missile and which be affectionately know a sherwood forest i ask the same question inside the launch control room of an atlas missile base in wyoming where officer who wear sidearms be man the commit button that could start a war accidentally or by design and in the command center where other pistol pack men could give order to push such button to the men in the instrument jam bomber cockpit submarine compartment and the antiseptic windowless room that would be the foxhole of tomorrow s impersonal intercontinental war the question seem farfetched there be unceasing pressure but it source be immediate readiness exercise be almost continuous each could be the real thing in the command center there be special clock ready to tick off the minute elapse since e hour e stand for execution the moment a go order would unleash an american nuclear strike there be little time for the men in the command center to reflect about the implication of these clock they be preoccupy rid herd on control panel switch flash color light on pale green or gray console that look like business machine they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical detail accidental war be so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involve in one be tell just enough so they can perform their portion of incredibly complex task among the policy maker general physicist psychologist and others charge with control the action of the button pusher and their hardware the answer to my question vary partly accord to a man s flair for what the professional in this field call scenario a an air force psychiatrist put it you can t have dry run on this one the expert be thus force to hypothesize sequence of event that have never occur probably never will but possibly might only one rule prevail in my conversation with these men the more highly place they be that be the more they know the more concern they have become already accidental war be a silent guest at the discussion within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other question of national security only recently new hole be discover in our safety measure and a search be now on for more work be under way to see whether new restrain device should be instal on all nuclear weapon meanwhile the expert speak of war trigger by false pre emption escalation unauthorized behavior and other term that will be discuss in this report they inhabit a secret world center on go cod and gold phone their conversation be almost invariably accompany by the same gesture arm and point forefinger dart toward each other in arclike semicircular motion one arm represent our bomber and missile the other arm theirs yet implicit in each movement be the death of million perhaps hundred of million perhaps you and me and the expert these men be not callous it be their job to think about the unthinkable unanimously they believe that the world would become a safe place if more of u and more russian and communist chinese too think about accidental war the first systematic think about this pandora s box within pandora s box be do four year ago by fred ikle a frail meek mannered swiss bear sociologist he be and be with the rand corporation a nonprofit pool of thinker finance by the u s air force his investigation make him the paul revere of accidental war and safety procedure be enormously increase in recent week a a result of a sweep defense policy reappraisal by the kennedy administration basic unite state strategy have be modify and large new sum allocate to meet the accidental war danger and to reduce it a quickly a possible the chain start at bmews ballistic missile early warn system in thule greenland it radar screen would register soviet missile shortly after they be launch against the unite state bmews intelligence be simultaneously flash to norad north american air defense command in colorado spring colorado for interpretation to the sac command and control post forty five foot below the grind at offutt air force base near omaha nebraska to the joint war room of the joint chief of staff in the pentagon and to the president telephone teletypes several kind of radio system and in some case television link all vital point alternate location exist for all key command center for last ditch emergency sac have alternate command post on kc jet tanker multiple circuit rout and frequency make the chain a unbreakable a possible the same principle of redundancy apply to all communication on these special network and no message can be transmit on these circuit until sender and receiver authenticate in advance by special cod that the message actually come from their purport source additional cod can be use to challenge and counterchallenge the authentication only the president be permit to authorize the use of nuclear weapon that s the law but what if somebody decide to break it the president can not personally remove the safety device from every nuclear trigger he make the momentous decision hundred of men be require to pass the word to the button pusher and to push the button what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly coolly decide to clobber the russian what if the president himself in the language of the military go ape or singlehandedly decide to reverse national policy and hit the soviet without provocation nobody can be absolutely certain of the answer however the system be design ingeniously and hopefully so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war even the president can not pick up his telephone and give a go order even he do not know the one signal for a nuclear strike the go code in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the gold phone circuit a system of gold actually yellow phone connect him with the office and action station of the secretary of defense the joint chief of staff the sac commander and other key men all can be connect with the gold circuit from their home all could help the president make his decision the talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble vital question would be quickly answer accord to a preprepared agenda officer who participate in the continual practice drill assure me that the president s decision could be make and announce on the gold circuit within minute after the first flash from aj if communication work his decision would be instantly know in all command post that would originate the actual go order for these center too be on the gold circuit they include the navy s atlantic command at norfolk virginia which be in contact with the polaris sub nato headquarters in europe air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control tactical fighter on ship and land base and sac which control long range bomber and atlas missile let u look in on one of these nerve center sac at omaha and see what must still happen before a wing of b bomber could drop their aj in a word plenty the key man almost certainly would be col william w wisman sac s senior controller he or his deputy or one of their seven assistant all full colonel man the heart of the command post twenty four hour a day it be a quiet but impressive room foot long thirty nine foot wide twenty one foot high movable panel of floor to ceiling map and chart be cram with intelligence information and bill wisman forty three a farmer s son from beallsville ohio be a quiet but impressive man his eye be steady anchor of the deep brown his movement and speech be precise clear and quick no question ruffle him or cause him to hesitate wisman who have have the chief controller s job for four year call the signal for a team operate three row of dull gray console stud with light switch and button at least a dozen men some armed be never far away from him in front of him be a gold phone in emergency the sac commander gen thomas power or his deputy and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretch across the length of the room above wisman and his staff at general power s seat in the balcony there be also a gold phone general power would participate in the decision make wisman below would listen in and act his console can give him instant contact with more than seventy base around the world and with every sac aircraft he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receiver at his extreme leave right next to the big red button mark alert there be two receiver in case one should be drop and damage but wisman too do not know the go code he must take it from the red box in point of fact this be a beige box with a bright red door about one and a half foot square and hang from the wall about six foot from the door to wisman s right the box be internally wire so the door can never be open without set off a screeching klaxon it s real obnoxious now we must become vague for we be approach one of the nation s most guard secret the cod in the red box there be several of them cover various contingency be contain in a seal x ray proof unique device they be supply a batch at a time by a secret source and be continually change by wisman or his staff at random interval but even the content of wisman s box can not start a war they be mere fragment just one portion of preprepared message what these fragment be and how they activate the go order may not be reveal the piece must be place in the context of the prepare message by wisman s staff in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedure which precede and follow the send of the go message again in special cod each message also contain an internal authenticator another specific signal to convince the recipient that he be get the real thing i ask wisman what would happen if he break out the go cod and try to start transmit one i d wind up full of bullet hole he say and there be no question that he be talk about bullet fire by his coworkers now let u imagine a wing of b s on alert near their positive control or fail safe point the spot on the map many mile from soviet territory beyond which they be forbid to fly without specific order to proceed to their target they too have fragment of the go code with them a wisman put it they have separate piece of the pie and we have the whole pie once we send out the whole pie they can put their piece into it unless we send out the whole pie their piece mean nothing why do wisman s ever change code always mesh with the fragment in possession of the button pusher the answer be a cryptographic secret at any rate three men out of a six man b crew be require to copy down wisman s go to war message each must match wisman s pie with the fragment that he carry with him all three must compare note and agree to go after that it require several minute of concentrate work include six separate and deliberate action by a minimum of three men sit at three separate station in a bomber each with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be release unless all gadget be properly operate and the wire and seal from the handle remove first no damage can be do
cg04,cg04,informative,lettres,2359,suddenly however their posture change and the game end they go a rigid a black statuary six figure lean and tall and angular go still their head be in the air sniff they all swing at the same instant in the same direction they saw it before i do even with my binoculars it be nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall a dull gray sheet which reach from a layer of cloud to the earth in the degree of horizon it obscure only a degree no more a white man would not have see it the aborigine fasten upon it with a concentration beyond pathos watch they wait until the squall thicken and begin to move in a long drift slant across the dry burn land at once the whole band set off at a lope they be chase a rain cloud they go after the squall a mercilessly a a wolf pack after an abandon cow i follow them in the jeep and now they do not care the game be over this be life occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot sometimes i guess it be because the rain squall have change direction sometimes it be to skirt a gulley their gait be impossible to convey in word it have nothing of the proud stride of the train runner about it it be not a lope it be not do with style or verve it be the gait of the human who must run to live arm dangle leg barely swing over the grind head hang down and only occasionally swing up to see the target a loose motion that be just short of stumble and yet be wonderfully graceful it be a barely control skim of the grind they run for three hour finally avoid hummock and seek low grind they intercept the rain squall for ten minute they run beneath the squall raise their arm and for the first time shout and caper then the wind die and the rain squall hold steady they be study the grind suddenly one of them shout run a few foot bend forward and put his mouth to the grind he have find a depression with rain water in it he bend down a black cranelike figure and put his mouth to the grind with a lordly and generous gesture the discoverer stand up and beckon to the close of his fellow the other trot over and swoop at the tiny puddle in an instant he have suck it dry the aborigine life on the cruelest land i have ever see which do not mean that it be ugly part of it be of course there be thousand of square mile of salt pan which be hideous they be huge area which have be sweep by wind for so many century that there be no soil leave but only deep bare ridge fifty or sixty yard apart with ravine between them thirty or forty foot deep and the only thing that move be a scuttle layer of sand such stretch have an inhuman moonlike quality but much of the land which the aborigine wander look a if it should be hospitable it be soften by the saltbush and the bluebush have a peaceful quality the hill roll softly the malignancy of such a landscape have be beautifully describe by the australian charles bean he tell of three men who start out on a trip across a single paddock a ten by ten mile square own by a sheep grazer they go well equip with everything except knowledge of the outback country the countryside look like a beautiful open park with gentle slop and soft gray tree clump nothing appal or horrible rush upon these men only there happen nothing there might have be a pool of cool water behind any of these tree clump only there be not it might have rain any time only it do not there might have be a fence or a house just over the next rise only there be not they lay with the bird hop from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peep down at them no one come the white men die and countless others like them have die even today range rider will come upon mummify body of men who attempt nothing more difficult than a twenty mile hike and slowly lose direction be torture by the heat drive mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally die the aborigine be not deceive he know that the land be hard and pitiless he know that the economy of life in the outback be awful there be no room for error or waste any organism that falter or misperceive the signal or weaken be do i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self conscious challenge but i suspect that it can perhaps this be what give the aborigine his odd air of dignity the family at the boulder see an aborigine today be a difficult thing many of them have drift into the city and town and seaport others be confine to vast reservation and not only do the australian government justifiably not wish them to be view a exhibit in a zoo but on their reservation they be extremely fugitive shun camp come together only for corroborees at which their strange culture come to it high pitch which be very low indeed i persuade an australian friend who have live outback for year to take me to see some aborigine live in the bush it be a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation even though the rancher be say to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigine and their language finally however the arrangement be make and we drive out into the bush in a land rover we follow the asphalt road for a few mile and then swing off onto a small road which be nothing more than two tire mark on the earth the rancher go a mile down this road and then when he reach a big red boulder swing off the road at once he start to glance toward the instrument panel it take me a moment to realize what be odd about that panel there be a gimbaled compass weld to it which rock gently back and forth a the land rover bounce about the rancher be navigate his way across the flatland do you always navigate like this i ask damned right he say once i get out on the flat i do some chap that know an area well can make their way by landmark a tree here a wash here a boulder there but if you don t know the place like the palm of your hand you d well use a compass and the speedometer two mile northeast then five mile southwest that sort of thing very simple he be right the landscape keep repeat itself i would try to memorize landmark and saw in a half hour that it be hopeless finally we approach the bivouac of the aborigine they be camp beside a large column shape boulder a man his lubra and two child the sun be not yet high and all of them be in the small area of shade cast by the boulder there be also a dog a dingo dog it rib show it be a yellow nondescript color it suffer from a variety of sore hair have scabbed off it body in patch it lay with it head on it paw and only it eye move watch u carefully it strike me a a very bright and very malnourish dog no one pat the dog it be not a pet it be a worker the bugger love shade the rancher say i suppose because it save them some loss of body water they ll move around that rock all day follow the shade during the hot part of the day of course the sun come straight down and there isn t any shade we drive close to the boulder stop the land rover and walk over toward the family the man be lean against the rock he gaze away from u a we approach he be over six foot tall and very thin his leg be narrow and very long every bone and muscle in his body show but he do not give the appearance of starve he have long black hair and a wispy beard the ridge over his eye be huge and his eyelid be half shut there be something about his face that disturb me and it take several second to realize what it be not merely that fly be crawl over his face but his narrow eyelid do not blink when the fly crawl into his eye socket a fly would crawl down the bulge forehead into the socket of the eye walk along the man s lash and across the wet surface of the eyeball and the eye do not blink the australian and i both be wear insect repellent and be not badly bother by insect but my eye water a we stand watch the aborigine i turn to look at the lubra she remain squat on her heel all the time we be there like the man she be entirely naked her long thin arm move in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possession which be place in front of her there be two rubbing stick for make fire two stone shape roughly like knife a weave root container which hold a few pound of dry worm and the dead body of some rodent there be also a long wooden spear and a woomera a spear throw device which give the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy there be also a boomerang elaborately carve everything be burnish with sweat and grease so that all of the object seem to have be carve from the same material and to be ageless the two child both boy wander around the australian and me for a few moment and then return to their work they squat on their heel with their head bend far forward their eye only a few inch from the grind they have locate the runway of a colony of ant and a the ant come out of the grind the boy pick them up one at a time and pinch them dead the tiny body drop onto a dry leaf make a pile a big a a small apple the odor here be more powerful than that which surround the town aborigine the smell at first be more surprise than unpleasant it be also subtly familiar for it be the odor of the human body but multiply innumerable time because of the fact that the aborigine never bath one s impulse be to say that the smell be a stink and unpleasant but that be a cliche and a dishonest one the smell be sexual but so powerfully so that a civilize nose must deny it their skin be cover with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which have almost the consistency of a second skin they roll at night in ash to keep warm and their second skin have a light dusty cast to it in spot such a the elbow and knee the second skin be wear off and i realize the aborigine be much dark than they appear a if the coating of sweat dirt and ash be a cosmetic the boy have beautiful dark eye and unlike their father they brush constantly at the fly and blink their eye that smell be something eh mate the australian ask they swear that every person smell different and every family smell different from every other at the corroborees when they get to dance and sweating you ll see them rubbing up against a man who s suppose to have a specially good smell idje here and he nod at the man be say to have great odor the stink be all the same to me but i really think they can make one another out blindfold here idje you fella like tabac he say sharply idje still star over our shoulder at the horizon the australian stop try to talk a pidgin i could understand and speak strange word from deep in his chest
cg05,cg05,informative,lettres,2394,it be a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth century be a great period in persian art the architect the tile and carpet maker the potter painter calligrapher and metalsmiths work through abbas s reign and those of his successor to enrich the city traveler enter from the desert be confound by what must have seem an illusion a great garden fill with nightingale and rose cut by canal and terrace promenade stud with water tank of turquoise tile in which be reflect the glisten blue curve of a hundred dome at the heart of all of this be the square which one such traveler declare to be a spacious a pleasant and aromatick a market a any in the universe in time isfahan come to be know a half the world isfahan nisf i jahan in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the size of london start to decline the afghan invade the safavids fell from power the capital go elsewhere the desert encroach isfahan become more of a legend than a place and now it be for many people simply a name to which they attach their notion of old persia and sometimes of the east they think of it a a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor those who actually get there find that it isn t spooky at all but a brilliant a a tile in sunlight but even for them it remain a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb a tomb in which persia lie well preserve but indeed dead everyone be ready to grant the persian their history but almost no one be will to acknowledge their present it seem that for persia and especially for this city there be only two time the glorious past and the corrupt depress sterile present the one apparent connection between the two be a score of build which somehow or other have survive and which naturally enough be call historical monument however just a all the build have not fall and flow back to their original mud so the value which want them and saw that they be build have not all disappear the value and talent which make the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the miniature continue in certain social institution which rise above the ordinary life of this city a the great build rise above blank wall and dirty lane often too the social institution be house in these pavilion and palace and bridge for these great structure be not simply historical monument they be the place where persian live the promenade for example continue to take place on the chahar bagh a mile long garden of plane and poplar tree that now serve a the city s principal street it take place a well along the terrace and through the arcade of the khaju bridge and also in the garden of the square on friday the day when many persian relax with poetry talk and a samovar people do not it be true stream into chehel sotun a pavilion and garden build by shah abbas in the seventeenth century but they do retire into hundred of pavilion throughout the city and up the river valley which be small more humble copy of the former and of course religious life continue to center in the more famous mosque and commercial life very much a social institution in the bazaar those three other great activity of the persian the bath the teahouse and the zur khaneh the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics dance chant poetry and music do not take place in build to which entrance ticket be sell but some of them occupy splendid example of persian domestic architecture long domed chalk white room with dais of turquoise tile their end wall cut through to the orchard and the sky by open arch but more important and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see be that these place and activity be often the setting in which persian exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibility water air fruit poetry music the human form these thing be important to persian and they experience them with an intense and discriminate awareness i should like by the way to make it clear that i be not use the word persian carelessly i don t mean a few aesthete who play about with sensation like a young prince in a miniature dabble his hand in a pool these thing be important to almost all persian and perhaps most important to the most ordinary the men cry love poem in an orchard on any summer s night be a often a not the lutihaw mustachioed tough who spend most of their life in and out of the local prison brothel and teahouse a few month ago it be a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lug me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for it clarity and flavor not long ago an acquaintance a slick head water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city stand on the balcony puff his first cigarette in week the air he say be just right a cigarette would taste particularly good i really didn t know what he mean it be a nice day grant but he know he sniff the air and lick it on his lip and know a a vintner know a vintage the natural world then plus poetry and some kind of art receive from the most ordinary of persian a great deal of attention the line of an eyebrow the color of the skin a ghazal from hafiz the purity of spring water the long afternoon among the bough which crowd the upper story of a pavilion these thing be notice judge and value nowhere in isfahan be this rich aesthetic life of the persian show so well a during the promenade at the khaju bridge there have probably always be a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city for one thing there be a natural belt of rock across the river bed for another it be here that one of the old caravan rout come in it be to provide a safe and spacious cross for these caravan and also to make a pleasance for the city that shah abbas in about build of sun bake brick tile and stone the present bridge it be a splendid structure from upstream it look like a long arcaded box lay across the river from downstream where the water level be much lower it be a high elaborately facaded pavilion the top story contain more than thirty alcove separate from each other by spandrel of blue and yellow tile at either end and in the center there be bay which contain nine great alcove a fresco and capacious a church apse here in the old day when they have come to see the moon or display of firework sit the king and his court while priest soldier and other member of the party lounge in the small alcove between below twenty vault tunnel through the understructure of the bridge these be traverse by another line of vault and thus room arch on all four side be form down through the axis of the bridge there be a long diminish vista like a visual echo of pier and arch while the vault front upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountain and river pool here on the hot day it be cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flow in the sluice at the bottom of the vault on the downstream or pavilion side these vault give out onto terrace twice a wide a the bridge itself from the terrace eighteen in all broad flight of step descend into the water or onto still more terrace barely above the level of the river out of water brick and tile they have make far more than just a bridge on spring and summer evening people leave their shop and house and walk up through the lane of the city to the bridge it be a great spectacle the bridge itself rise up from the river light flare and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera crowd press along the terrace down the step in and out of the arcade mass against it a though it be a fortress under siege all kind come to walk in the promenade merchant from the bazaar bickering over a deal a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hack jacket dervish who stand with the stillness of the blind their eye film with rheum and vision the old kajar prince arrive in their ancient limousine student civil servant beggar musician hawker and clown family go out to the edge of the terrace to sit on carpet around a samovar below people line the step a though on bleacher to watch the sky and river above in the tile proscenium of the alcove boy sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi while at the very bottom in the vault the tough and blade of the city hoot and bang their drum drink arak play dice and dance here in an evening persian enjoy many of the thing which be important to them poetry water the moon a beautiful face to a stranger their delight in these thing may seem paradoxical for persian chase the golden calf a much a any people many of them moreover be begin to complain about the scarcity of western amusement and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant the mullah and the peasant nonetheless they take time out much time from the game of grab and these new western experiment to go to the garden and riverbank above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere to hear or quote some poetry poetry in persian life be far more than a common grind on which in a society deeply fissure by antagonism all may stand it contain in fact their whole outlook on life and it be express at least to their taste in a perfect form poetry for a persian be nothing less than truth and beauty in most western culture today these twin have be send away to the library and museum in persia where practically speak there be no museum or library or for that matter hardly any book the twin run free it be perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine that tonight on london bridge the teddy boy of the east end will gather to sing marlowe herrick shakespeare and perhaps some lyric of their own that at any rate be what happen at the khaju bridge boy and men go along the riverbank or to the alcove in the top arcade here in these little room or stage arch open to the sky and river they choose a few line out of the hundred they may know and sing them accord to one of the mode into which persian music be divide each mode be believe to have a specific attribute one induce pleasure another generosity another love and so on to include all of the emotion the singer simply match the poem to a mode for example the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem they bring me news that spring be in the plain and ahmad s blood the crimson tulip stain go tell his age mother that her son fight with a thousand foe and he be one or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet know ye fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth that here with dust upon his eye iraj the sweet tongue singer lie in this true lover s tomb inter a world of love lie sepulchred these song practically all persian music for that matter be limit to a range of two octave yet within this limitation there be an astonish variety design a intricate a that in the carpet or miniature with the melodic line like the paint or weave line often flow into an arabesque

it there be always and at all time a contemporary music and it express the era in which it be create but i usually stick to the old phrase ich habe ein amt aber keine meinung i hold an office but i do

i claim that german youth seem to lack the enthusiasm which be a necessary ingredient of anger and might be classify a uninterested and bore rather than angry i be far from convince of the truth of my statement but could not think of anything that might evoke response more quickly it be easy for you to talk counter a twenty year old law student you travel around the world we would like to do that too but you want a job guarantee when you return i continue my attack you must have some security say a young clerk when i mention that for my first long voyage i do not even have the money for the return fare but have trust to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount the young people look at me doubtingly one girl express what be obviously in their mind would you advise u to act the same way you might have fail i think it be rather foolhardy to trust to luck others mention that i might have have to ask friend or even stranger for help and that to be strand in a foreign country without sufficient fund do not contribute to international understand the debate need no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expect from life what his hop be and what his

among them what they wish for most be security what they fear most be war or political instability in their own country the ideal home they agree would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five room just enough for a family consist of husband wife and two child no one want a large family or no child and none hop for a castle or say that live in less settle circumstance would be satisfactory all express interest in world affair but no one offer to make any sacrifice to satisfy this interest

a with washington jefferson and jay in others by business and professional acumen a with franklin and adam or in hamilton s case by an influential marriage unlike so many of the power starve intellectual in underdevelop nation of our own day they command both prestige and influence before the revolution start a different physically a the tall angular jefferson be from the chubby rotund adam the seven be strike individualist ardent opinionated even obstinate they be amazingly articulate write their own copy and be master of phrasemaking capable of endure friendship they be also stout controversialist who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pen john adam dismiss john dickinson who vote against the declaration of independence a a certain great fortune and piddle genius washington castigate his critic general conway a be capable of all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappoint vanity and hamilton who felt it a religious duty to oppose aaron burr s political ambition would have be a well actuarial risk have he show more literary restraint the seven founder be completely dedicate to the public service madison once remark my life have be so much a public one a comment which fit the career of the other six franklin retire from edit and publish at the age of and for the next forty two year devote himself to public scientific and philanthropic interest washington never have a chance to work for an extend stretch at the occupation he love best plantation management he serve a commander in chief during the revolution without compensation john adam take to heart the advice give him by his legal mentor jeremiah gridley to pursue the study of the law rather than the gain of it in take account of seventeen year of law practice adam conclude that no lawyer in america ever do so much business a i do and for so little profit when the revolution break out he along with jefferson and jay abandon his career at the bar

nature and of nature s god they fight hard but they be forgive to former foe and seek to prevent vindictive legislature from confiscate tory property in violation of the treaty of this sense of moderation and fairness be superbly exemplify in an exchange of letter between john jay and a tory refugee peter van schaack jay have participate in the decision that exile his old friend van schaack yet when at war s end the ex tory make the first move to resume correspondence jay write him from paris where he be negotiate the peace settlement a an independent american i consider all who be not

write in think continentally hamilton counsel the young nation this new force love of country super impose upon if not displace affectionate tie to one s own state be epitomize by washington his first inaugural address speak of my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love all seek the fruition of that nationalism in a federal government with substantial power save jefferson all participate in the frame or ratification of the federal constitution they support it not a a perfect instrument but a the best obtainable historian have traditionally regard the great debate of the seventeen ninety a polarize the issue of centralize v limit government with hamilton and the nationalist support the former and jefferson and madison uphold the latter position the state s right position be formulate by jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolve but in their late career a head of state the two prove themselves well hamiltonians than jeffersonian in purchasing louisiana jefferson have to adopt hamilton s broad construction of the constitution and so do madison in advocate the rechartering of hamilton s bank which he have so strenuously oppose at it inception and in adopt a hamiltonian protective tariff indeed the old jeffersonian be far more atune to the hamilton orient whig than they be to the jacksonian democrat when in the south carolina nullifier adopt the principle of state interposition which madison have advance in his old virginia resolve they elicit no encouragement from that senior statesman in his political testament advice to my country pen just before his death madison express the wish that the union of the state be cherish and perpetuate let the open enemy to it be regard a a pandora with her box open and the disguise

cg08,cg08,informative,lettres,2322,tobacco road be dead long live tobacco road nostalgic yankee reader of erskine caldwell be today inform by proud georgian that tobacco road be bury beneath a four lane super highway over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concern with the dow jones average than with the cotton crop thus we be compel to face the urbanization of the south an urbanization which despite it dramatic and overwhelm effect upon the southern culture have be utterly ignore by the bulk of southern writer indeed it seem that only in today s southern fiction do tobacco road with all the traditional trimming of sowbelly and cornbread and mint julep continue to live but only a a weary overexploit phantom those writer know collectively a the southern school have receive accolade from even those critic least prone to eulogize accord to many critic in fact the south have lead the north in literature since the civil war both quantitatively and qualitatively such writer a william faulkner and robert penn warren have lead the field of somewhat less important writer in a sort of post bellum renaissance it be interest however that despite this strong upsurge in southern write almost none of the writer have forsake the firmly entrench concept of the white suit big daddy colonel sip a mint julep a he silently recount the revenue from the season s cotton and tobacco crop of the stereotype negro servant chant hymn a they plow the field of these and a host of other antiquate legend that deny the south it progressive leap of the past century this be not to say that the south be no long agrarian such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification but the south be and have be for the past century engage in a wide sweep urbanization which oddly enough be not reflect in it literature in the south be only urban in it have become urban in a mere half century the south have more than triple it urban status there be a new south emerge a south lose the folksy tradition of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche especially within recent decade a the new south snowball toward far urbanization it become more and more homogeneous with the north a tendency which willard thorp term yankeefication a evidence in such city a charlotte birmingham and houston it be say that even at the present stage of southern urbanization such a city a atlanta be not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton undoubtedly even the old southern stalwart richmond have felt the new wind william styron mention in his late novel an avenue name for bankhead mcgruder a civil war general now rename in typical california fashion buena vista terrace the effect of television and other mass medium be erase regional dialect and localism with a startle force a for progress the backward south can boast of baton rouge which increase it population between and by two hundred and sixty two percent to the second large growth of the period for all city over the field then be ripe for new southerner to step to the fore and write of this twentieth century phenomenon the southern yankeefication the new urban economy the city dweller the pain of transition the labor problem the list be obviously endless but these source have not be tap truman capote be still revel in southern gothicism exaggerate the old southern legend into something beautiful and grotesque but a unreal a or even more unreal than yesterday william styron while face the change economy with a certain uneasy reluctance insist he be not to be classify a a southern writer and yet include traditional southern concept in everything he publish even the great god faulkner the south s one probable contender for literary immortality have little concern himself with these matter such be simply not within his bound province where be the writer to treat these change have the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism be somehow dread or unwanted perhaps present writer hypnotically cling to the old order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeat test over the decade lack the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy these writer seem to be content themselves with an old one that be now a defunct a confederate money an example of the change which have creep over the southern region may be see in the southern negro s quest for a position in the white dominate society a problem that have be reflect in regional fiction especially since today the negro must discover his role in an industrialize south which indicate that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma hasn t change radically but rather have gradually come to be reflect in this new context this new coat of paint the negro face a much if not more difficulty in fit himself into an urban economy a he do in an agrarian one this represent a gradual change in an ever present social problem but there have be abrupt change a well the sit in the picket line the bus strike all of these be unheard of even ten year ago today s evidence such a the fact that only three southern state south carolina alabama and mississippi still openly defy integration would have astound many of yesterday s southerner into speechlessness other example of gradual change that have affect the negro have be his move up row by row in the bus his request and often get high wage well work condition well school change that be slowly emerge even before the supreme court decision of then come this decision which speed the process of gain equality or perhaps hinder it only historical evolution will determine which an abrupt change since the negro s desire for social justice have lead to an ironically anarchical rebellion he have frequently refuse to move from white lunch counter refuse to obey local law which he consider unjust while in other case he have appeal to federal law this bold self assertion after decade of humble subservience be indeed a twentieth century phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern way of existence a new order be thrust itself into be a new south be emerge after the post bellum year of hesitation uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in define his new role in the amorphously define socio political organization of the white man the modern negro have not make a decisive debut into southern fiction it be clear that while most writer enjoy picturing the negro a a woolly head humble old agrarian who mutter yassuhs and sho nufs with blissful deference to his white employer or in old south term massuh this stereotype be doom to become in reality a obsolete a caldwell s lester while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scatter through the rural south such men appear to be a vanish breed writer openly admit that the negro be easy to write than the white man but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro type present an individualize negro character it would seem be one of the most difficult assignment a southern writer could tackle and the success of such an endeavor be a suggest above glaringly rare just a the negro situation point up the gradual and abrupt change affect southern life it also point up the non representation of urbanism in southern literature the book concern with the negro s role in an urban society be rare indeed recently only keith wheeler s novel peaceable lane have openly face the problem all but the most rabid of confederate flag waver admit that the old southern tradition be defunct in actuality and sigh that it pass be accompany by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic tradition of the reputedly languid ante bellum way of life many early writer mourning the demise of the old order tend to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious old south imagery create such last impression a margaret mitchell s tara plantation modern writer who be suppose to keep their finger firmly upon the pulse of their subject insist upon draw out this legend prolong it burial when it well deserve a rest after the overexploitation of the past century perhaps these writer have be too deeply move by this romanticize but they can hardly deny that exaggerate or not the old panorama be dead a john t westbrook say in his article twilight of southern regionalism southwest review winter the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry should be leave to rest in peace forever dead and let u fervently hope forever do with westbrook far bemoan the southern writer creation of an unreal image of their homeland which be too readily assimilate by both foreign reader and visit yankee our northerner be suspicious of all this crass evidence of urbanization present to his sens it bewilder and befuddle him he be too deeply steep in william faulkner and robert penn warren the fume of progress be in his nose and the bright steel of industry tower before his eye but his heart be away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hog and night rider on this trip to the south he want above all else to sniff the effluvium of backwoods and sand hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight obviously such a northern tourist s purpose be somewhat akin to a child s experience with disneyland he want to see a world of make believe in the meantime while the south have be undergo this phenomenal modernization that be so disappoint to the curious yankee southern writer have certainly do little to reflect and promote their region s progress willard thorp in his new book american write in the twentieth century observe quite validly it seem certain subject be conspicuously absent or have be only lightly touch no southern novelist have do for atlanta or birmingham what herrick dreiser and farrell do for chicago or do passos do for new york there be almost no fictional treatment of the industrialize south not a single southern author major or minor have make the urban problem of an urban south his primary source material faulkner for one appear to be safe from the accuse finger of all assailant in this regard faulkner culminate the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it have ever be or could ever be do he have make it his and his it remain irrevocably he treat it with a mythological universal application a his disciple boast even though his emphasis be elsewhere faulkner do show his awareness of the change order of the south quite keenly a can be prove by a quick recall of his sartoris and snopes family even two decade ago in go down moses faulkner be look to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through it youth and it new way of life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erase from it soil yet his concern even here be with a slowly change socio economic order in general and he never deal with such specific aspect of this change a the urban and industrial impact faulkner trace in his vast and overpower saga of yoknapatawpha county the gradual change which seep into the south build layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way thus faulkner remind u and wisely that the new south have gradually evolve out of the old south and consequently it agrarian root persist yet he present a realm of source material which may well serve other writer if not himself the problem with which a new south must grapple in grope through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stand between the agrarian and his soil the thousand of city migrant who desert the farm yearly must readjust with even great stress and tension the sacred wilderness be gradually surrender to suburb and research park and industrial area
cg09,cg09,informative,lettres,2278,another element to concern the choreographer be that of the visual device of the theatre most avant garde creator true to their interest in the self sufficiency of pure movement have tend to dress their dancer in simple line and solid color often black and to give them a bare cyclorama for a set but robert rauschenberg the neo dadaist artist have collaborate with several of them he have design a match backdrop and costume of point of color on white for mr cunningham s summerspace so that dancer and background merge into a shimmer unity for mr taylor s image and reflection she make some diaphanous tent that alternately hide and reveal the performer and a girl s cape line with grass mr nikolais have make a distinctive contribution to the art of costume and decor in fact he call his production dance theatre work of motion shape light and sound to raise the dancer out of his personal pedestrian self mr nikolais have experiment with relate him to a large environmental orbit he begin with mask to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appear to be he go on to use object hoop pole cape which he employ a extension of the body of the dancer who move with them the depersonalization continue a the dancer be far metamorphose by the play of light upon his figure in each case the object the color even the percussive sound of the electronic score be design to become part of the theatrical be of the performer the dancer who never loosen her hold on a parasol begin to feel that it be part of herself or clothe from head to toe in fabric stretch over a series of hoop the performer may well lose his sense of self in be a finial a the dancer be depersonalize his accouterment be animize and the combine element give birth to a new be from this be come new movement idea that utilize dancer and property a a single unit thus the avant garde choreographer have extend the scope of material available for dance composition but since they have reject both narrative and emotional continuity how be they to unify the impressive array of material at their disposal some look deliberately to device use by creator in the other art and apply correspond method to their own work others less consciously but quite probably influence by the trend of the time experiment with approach that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter and musician an approach that have appeal to some choreographer be reminiscent of charles olson s statement of the process of projective verse one perception must immediately and directly lead to a far perception the creator trust his intuition to lead him along a path that have internal validity because it mirror the reality of his experience he disdain external restriction conventional syntax traditional metre the unit of form be determine subjectively the heart by the way of the breath to the line the test of form be fidelity to the experience a gauge also accept by the abstract expressionist painter an early but still influential school of painting surrealism have suggest the way of deal with the dream experience that event in which seemingly incongruous object be link together through the curious association of the subconscious the result picture might appear a maze of restless confusion and contradiction but it be more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrive order the contemporary painter tend to depict not the concrete object of his experience but their essence a reveal in abstraction of their line color mass and energy he be still concern however with a personal event he accept the accident of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience some painter have less interest in the experience of the moment with it attendant urgency and ambiguity than in look beyond the flux of particular impression to a high more serene level of truth rather than put their trust in ephemeral sensation they seek form in the stable relationship of pure design which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world the concept remain subjective but in this approach it be the artist s ultimate insight rather than his immediate impression that give form to the work others look to more objective device of order the musician employ the serial technique of composition establish a mathematical system of rotation that once set in motion determine the sequence of pitch and even of rhythm and intensity the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of interval or rhythm or dynamic change he may even alter the pattern by apply a scheme of random number but he can not order his element by will either rational or inspire the system work a an impersonal mechanism musician who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development again the composer must select his own material but a toss of coin with perhaps the add safeguard of reference to the oracle of the i ching the chinese book of change dictate the handle of the chosen material avant garde choreographer seek new form of continuity for their new vocabulary of movement have turn to similar approach some let dance take their form from the experience of creation accord to katherine litz the become the process of realization be the dance the process stipulate that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he have discover and that he feel the rightness of the quality that be to follow it the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example a quiet meditative sway of the body succeed by a violent leap or it may involve more subtle distinction the sway may be gradually minimize or enlarge it rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modify or it may be transfer to become a movement of only the arm or the head even the least alteration will change the quality an exploration of these possible relationship constitute the process of creation and thereby give form to the dance the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic a it be for miss litz or spontaneous a it be for merle marsicano she too be concern with the become the process of realization but she do not think in term of subtle variation of spatial or temporal pattern the design be determine emotionally i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapult recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confront me look back miss marsicano feel that her idea may have be influence by those of jackson pollock at one time she felt impel to make dance that move all over the stage much a pollock s painting move violently over the full extent of the canvas but her conscious need be to break away from constrict pattern of form a need to let the experience shape itself midi garth also believe in subjective continuity that begin with the feel engender by an initial movement it may be a free front back swing of the leg lead to a sideways swing of the arm that develop into a turn and the sensation of take off from the grind this become a dance call prelude to flight a pervade quality of free lyricism and a build from turn close to the grind towards jump into the air give the work it central focus alwin nikolais object to art a an outpouring of personal emotion he seek to make his dancer more godlike by relate them to the impersonal element of shape light color and sound if his dancer be sometimes make to look a if they might be creature from mar this be consistent with his intention of place them in the orbit of another world a world in which they be free of their pedestrian identity it be through the metamorphose dancer that the germ of form be discover in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer move and this self in the first reveal stroke of it existence state the theme from which all else must follow the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shape evolve it may be a reaction to a percussive sound the follow movement constitute far reaction it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color in which case change in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual design unconcerned with the practical function of his action the dancer be engross exclusively in their motional content movement unfold freely because they be uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive but the metamorphosis must come first though he be also concern with free dance from pedestrian mode of activity merce cunningham have select a very different method for achieve his aim he reject all subjectively motivate continuity any line of action relate to the concept of cause and effect he base his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything an order can be chance rather than chosen and this approach produce an experience that be free and discover rather than bind and remember thus there be freshness not only in the individual movement of the dance but in the shape of their continuity a well chance he find enable him to create a world beyond imagination he cite with pleasure the comment of a lady who exclaim after a concert why it s extremely interest but i would never have think of it myself the sequence of movement in a cunningham dance be unlike any sequence to be see in life at one side of the stage a dancer jump excitedly nearby another sit motionless while still another be twirl an umbrella a man and a girl happen to meet they look straight at the audience not at each other he lift her put her down and walk off neither please nor disturb a if nothing have happen if one dancer slap another the victim may do a pirouette sit down or offer his assailant a fork and spoon event occur without apparent reason their consequence be irrelevant or there be no consequence at all the sequence be determine by chance and mr cunningham make use of any one of several chance device he may toss coin he may take slip of paper from a grab bag the answer derive by these mean may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also it spatial design special slip designate the location on the stage where the movement be to be perform the other variable include the dancer who be to perform the movement and the length of time he be to take in it performance the only factor that be personally set by the choreographer be the movement themselves the number of the dancer and the approximate total duration of the dance the approximate be important because even after the order of the work have be establish by the chance method the result be not inviolable each performance may be different if a work be divide into several large segment a last minute draw of random number may determine the order of the segment for any particular performance and any sequence can not only change it position in the work but can even be eliminate from it altogether mr cunningham try not to cheat the chance method he adhere to it dictate a faithfully a he can however there be always the possibility that chance will make demand the dancer find impossible to execute then the choreographer must arbitrate he must rearrange matter so that two performer do not bump into each other he must construct transition so that a dancer who be tell to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap
cg10,cg10,informative,lettres,2301,the north and the south be in great agreement on sovereignty through all their dispute about it than be the found father the truth in their conflict concept be expound by statesman of the calibre of webster and calhoun and defend in the end by leader of the nobility of lincoln and lee the people everywhere have grow meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principle in understand of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their union repeat effort begin with the missouri compromise of be make by such master moderate a clay and douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise rather than clear think and timely action even so confusion in this period gain such strength from compromise and other factor that it lead to the bloody war of the nineteenth century nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic people that lie in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty the present issue in atlantica whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nation into a federal union of sovereign citizen resemble the american one of rather than the one that be resolve by civil war and so i would only touch upon it now much a i have long want to write a book about it i think it be essential however to pinpoint here the difference between the two concept of sovereignty that go to war in if only to see well how imperative be our need today to clarify completely our far bad confusion on this subject the difference come down to this the southern state insist that the unite state be in last analysis what it name imply a union of state to their leader the constitution be a compact make by the people of sovereign state who therefore retain the right to secede from it this right of the state it upholder contend be essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralize power in the union government the champion of the union maintain that the constitution have form fundamentally the unite people of america that it be a compact among sovereign citizen rather than state and that therefore the state have no right to secede though the citizen could write to speed on august lincoln make the latter point clear in homely term whose timeliness be startle today he thus declare his own right to secede we begin by declare that all men be create equal we now practically read it all men be create equal except negro when the know nothing get control it will read all men be create equal except negro and foreigner and catholic when it come to this i shall prefer emigrate to some country where they make no pretence of love liberty to russia for instance where despotism can be take pure without the base alloy of hypocrisy his emphasis when the southern state exercise their right to secede they form what they officially style the confederate state of america dictionary a we have see still cite this government along with the article of confederation of a an example of a confederacy the fact be that the southern confederacy differ from the early one almost a much a the federal constitution do the confederate constitution copy much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in substance it operate on by and for the people individually just a do the federal constitution it make substantially the same division of power between the central and state government and among the executive legislative and judicial branch the difference between confederacy and federal union in many believe and understandably that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution be that the former recognize the right of each state to secede but though each of it member have assert this right against the union the final constitution which the confederacy sign on march nearly a month before hostility begin include no explicit provision authorize a state to secede it drafter discuss this vital point but leave it out of their constitution their president jefferson davis interpret their constitution to mean that it admit of no coerce association but this remain so doubtful that there be frequent demand that the right to secede be put into the constitution the constitution of the southern confederation differ from that of the federal union only in two important respect it openly defiantly recognize slavery an institution which the southerner of even though they continue it find so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoid mention the word in the federal constitution they recognize that slavery be a moral issue and not merely an economic interest and that to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they have set forth in the declaration of that all men be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain unalienable right that among them be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the other important difference between the two constitution be that the president of the confederacy hold office for six instead of four year and be limit to one term these be not however difference in federal structure the only important difference from that standpoint between the two constitution lie in their preamble the one of make clear that in make their government the people be act through their state whereas the preamble of express a clearly a language can the opposite concept that they be act directly a citizen here be the two preamble federal constitution we the people of the unite state in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the unite state of america confederate constitution we the people of the confederate state each state act in it sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal government establish justice insure domestic tranquility and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity invoke the favor and the guidance of almighty god do ordain and establish this constitution for the confederate state of america one be tempt to say that on the difference between the concept of sovereignty in these two preamble the worst war of the nineteenth century be fight but though the southern state when drafting a constitution to unite themselves narrow the difference to this fine point by omit to assert the right to secede the fact remain that by secede from the union they have already act on the concept that it be compose primarily of sovereign state if the union concede this to them the same right must be concede to each remain state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the state and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the state all the liberty the citizen have gain by their union lincoln saw that the act of secession make the issue for the union a vital one whether it be a union of sovereign citizen that should continue to live or an association of sovereign state that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism much a he abhor slavery lincoln be always will to concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it though his election be interpret by many southerner a the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union lincoln himself propose no such change in the right the constitution give the state after the war begin he long refuse to permit emancipation of the slave by union action even in the border state that stay with the union he issue his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity leave him no other way to save the union in his message of december he put his purpose and his policy in these word which i would call the lincoln law of liberty and union in give freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free what lincoln could not concede be that the state rather than the people be sovereign in the union he fight to the end to preserve it a a government of the people by the people for the people the truth on each side win in the civil war the fact that the american who uphold the sovereignty of their state do this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery the antithesis of individual liberty make the conflict grimmer and the great out of this ordeal the citizen emerge in the south a in the north a america s true sovereign in a new birth of freedom a lincoln promise but before this come about american have give their life in battle for the two concept of the sovereign right of men and of state on their decisive battlefield lincoln do not distinguish between them when he pay tribute to the brave men live and dead who fight here he understand that both side be at fault and he reach the height of say so explicitly in his second inaugural to my knowledge lincoln remain the only head of state and commander in chief who while fight a fearful war whose issue be in doubt prove man enough to say this publicly to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there be some error and in all our error some truth so great a man could not but understand too that the thing that move men to sacrifice their life be not the error of their think which their opponent see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see any more than they see the error which mar the truth they themselves defend it be much less difficult now than in lincoln s day to see that on both side sovereign american have give their life in the civil war to maintain the balance between the power they have delegate to the state and to their union they differ in the balance they believe essential to the sovereignty of the citizen but the supreme sacrifice each make serve to maintain a still more fundamental truth that individual life liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two and on the limitation of sovereignty in all it aspect which this involve the american who give the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion preserve individual freedom in the unite state from the danger of anarchy inherent in confederation which throughout history have prove fatal in the end to all association compose primarily of sovereign state and to the liberty of their people but the fact that other american give the same measure of devotion to an oppose concept serve liberty and union in other essential way it appeal from ballot to bullet at fort sumter end by cost the southerner their right to have slave a right that be even less compatible with the sovereignty of man the very fact that they come so near to win by the wrong method war lead directly to their lose both the war and the wrong thing they fight for since it force lincoln to free their slave a a military measure there be a divine justice in one wrong thus undo another there be also a lesson one that have serve ever since to keep american in their conflict with one another from turn from the ballot to the bullet yet though the southern state lose the worst error in their case they do not lose the truth they fight for the life so many of them give to forestall what they believe would be a fatal encroachment by the union on the power reserve to their state have continue ever since to safeguard all american against freedom s other foe

external world the useful suggestion of professor david hawkins which consider culture a a third stage in biological evolution fit quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science have provide

which will enable u to cope with people a effectively a the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid build a structure of molecule which enable it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction the answer be of course yes for the family be the simple example of just such a unit compose of people which give u both some immunity from and a way of deal with other people social invention do not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire have to await lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulation of archimedes but it have be during the last two century during the scientific revolution that our independence from the physical environment have make the most rapid stride we have ample light when the sun set the temperature of our home be independent of the season we fly through the air although gravity pull u down the range of our voice ignore distance at what stage be social science then be the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physic at the time of newton there be a haunt resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in freud and it be certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievement and their impact political theoretical understand although almost at a standstill during this century do develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth century and result in a flood of invention which increase the possibility for man to coexist with man consitutional government popular vote trial by jury public education labor union cooperative commune socialize ownership world court and the veto power in world council be but a few example most of these with horrible exception be conceive a be a ship not a an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny it force but a a mean to survive and enjoy it the most effective political invention seem to make maximum use of natural harbor and be aware that restrain breakwater can play only a minor part in the whole scheme just a present technology have to await the explanation of physic so one might expect that social invention will follow grow sociological understand we be desperately in the need of such invention for man be still very much at the mercy of man in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction be day by day increase our fear of each other i want therefore to discus a second and quite different fruit of science the connection between scientific understand and fear there be certainly large area of understand in the human science which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fear lucretius have remark the reason why all mortal be so grip by fear be that they see all sort of thing happen in the earth and sky with no discernable cause and these they attribute to the will of god perhaps thing be even bad then it be difficult to reconstruct the primeval fear of man we get some clue from a few remembrance of childhood and from the circumstance that we be probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever be we be not now afraid of atomic bomb in the same way that people once fear comet the bomb be a harmless a an automobile in a garage we be worry about what people may do with them that some crazy fool may push the button i be certainly not adequately train to describe or enlarge on human fear but there be certain feature of the fear dispel by scientific explanation that stand out quite clearly they be in general those fear that once seem to have be amenable to prayer or ritual they include both individual fear and collective one they arise in situation in which one believe that what happen depend not only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group often it be recognize that all the detail of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because the pattern be empirically determine and not develop through theoretical understand one be never quite certain which behavior element be effective and the whole pattern become ritualize yet often fear persist because even with the most rigid ritual one be never quite free from the uneasy feel that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one have be unaware of the really decisive act to say that science have reduce many such fear merely reiterate the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminate much of magic and superstition but a somewhat more detail analysis of this process may be illuminate the frequently postulate antique worry that the daylight hour might dwindle to complete darkness apparently give rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize it be curious that even century of repetition of the yearly cycle do not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremony of the winter solstice this and other fear of the solar system have disappear gradually first with the ptolemaic system and it build in concept of periodicity and then more firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motion this understand provide a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without institute any control in fact although we have dispel the fear we have not necessarily assure ourselves that there be no danger there be still the remote possibility of planetoid collision a meteor could fall on san francisco solar activity could presumably bring long period of flood or drought our understand of the solar system have teach u to replace our former elaborate ritual with the appropriate action which in this case amount to do nothing yet we no long feel uneasy this almost trivial example be nevertheless suggestive for there be some element in common between the antique fear that the day would get short and short and our present fear of war we in our country think of war a an external threat which if it occur will not be primarily of our own do and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depend in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the detail of how we behave what element of our behavior be decisive our weapon production our world prestige our idea of democracy our action of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage we have stave off a war and since our behavior have involve all these element we can only keep add to our ritual without dare to abandon any part of it since we have not the slight notion which part be effective i think that we be here also talk of the kind of fear that a young boy have for a group of boy who be approach at night along the street of a large city if an automobile be approach him he would know what be require of him even though he might not be able to act quickly enough with the group of boy it be different he do not know whether to look up or look aside to put his hand in his pocket or to clench them at his side to cross the street or to continue on the same side when confront with a drink or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others i believe that what i do have some effect on his action and i have learn in a way to commune with drunk but certainly my action seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carry out of an experiment in physic i be usually fill with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose our inability to explain why certain people be fond of u frequently induce the same kind of ritual and malaise we be force in our behavior towards others to adopt empirically successful pattern in toto because we have such a minimal understand of their essential element our collective policy group and national be similarly base on voodoo but here we often lack even the empirically successful ritual and be still engage in determing them we use term from our personal experience with individual such a trust cheat and get tough we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talk of the compulsion of celestial body to move in circle we perform elaborate international exhortation and ceremony with virtually no understand of social cause and effect small wonder then that we fear the achievement which dispel our fear of the cosmos take place three century ago what additional role have the scientific understand of the th and th century play in the physical science these achievement concern electricity chemistry and atomic physic in the life science there have be an enormous increase in our understand of disease in the mechanism of heredity and in bio and physiological chemistry the major effect of these advance appear to lie in the part they have play in the industrial revolution and in the tool which scientific understand have give u to build and manipulate a more protective environment in addition our way of deal directly with natural phenomenon have also change even in domain where detail and predictive understand be still lack but where some explanation be possible a with lightning and weather and earthquake the appropriate kind of human action have be more adequately indicate apparently the population a a whole eventually acquire enough confidence in the explanation of the scientist to modify it procedure and it fear how and why this process occur would provide an interest separate subject for study in some area the progress be slow than in others in agriculture for example despite the advance in biology elaborate ritual tend to persist along with a continue sense of the imminence of some natural disaster in child care the opposite extreme prevail procedure change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceed anything warrant by establish psychological theory there be many domain in which understand have bring about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear much of the former extreme uneasiness associate with vision and hallucination and with death have disappear the persistent horror of have a malformed child have i believe be reduce not because we have gain any control over this misfortune but precisely because we have learn that we have so little control over it in fact the recent warn about the use of x ray have introduce fear and ambiguity of action which now require more detail understand and thus in this instance science have momentarily aggravate our fear in fact insofar a science generate any fear it stem not so much from scientific prowess and gadget but from the fact that new unanswered question arise which until they be understand create uncertainty perhaps the most illuminate example of the reduction of fear through understand be derive from our increase knowledge of the nature of disease the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease contain close analogy to problem confront u with respect to people the fear of disease be formerly very much the kind of fear i have try to describe
cg12,cg12,informative,lettres,2332,nothing like godot he arrive before the hour his letter have suggest we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday and i come into the lobby a the clock strike twelve he be wait my wish to meet samuel beckett have be prompt by simple curiosity and interest in his work american newspaper reviewer like to call his play nihilistic they find deep pessimism in them even so astute a commentator a harold clurman of the nation have say that wait for godot be the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair but to me beckett s write have seem permeate with love for human be and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism could it be that my own eye and ear have deceive me be his a literature of defeat irrelevant to the social crisis we face or be it relevant because it teach u something useful to know about ourselves i know that a conversation with the author would not settle such question because a man be not the same a his write in the last analysis the question have to be settle by the work itself nevertheless i be curious my curiosity be sharpen a day or two before the interview by a conversation i have with a well inform teacher of literature a jesuit father at a conference on religious drama near paris when beckett s name come into the discussion the priest grow loud and tell me that beckett hat life that i think be at least one thing i can find out when we meet beckett s appearance be rough hew irish the feature of his face be distinct but not fine they look a if they have be sculpture with an unsharpened chisel unruly hair go straight up from his forehead stand so high that the top fall gently over a if to show that it really be hair and not bristle one might say it combine the man own pride and humility for he have the pride that come of self acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to impose himself upon another his light blue eye set deep within the face be actively and continually look he seem by some unconscious division of labor to have give them that one function and no other leave communication to the rest of the face the mouth frequently break into a disarm smile the voice be light in timbre with a rough edge that correspond to his visage the irish accent be a one would expect combine with slight inflection from the french his tweed suit be a baggy gray and green he wear a brown knit sport shirt with no tie we walk down the rue de l arcade thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church the conversation that ensue may have be engross but it could hardly be call world shatter for one thing the world that beckett see be already shatter his talk turn to what he call the mess or sometimes this buzz confusion i reconstruct his sentence from note make immediately after our conversation what appear here be short than what he actually say but very close to his own word the confusion be not my invention we can not listen to a conversation for five minute without be acutely aware of the confusion it be all around u and our only chance now be to let it in the only chance of renovation be to open our eye and see the mess it be not a mess you can make sense of i suggest that one must let it in because it be the truth but beckett do not take to the word truth what be more true than anything else to swim be true and to sink be true one be not more true than the other one can not speak anymore of be one must speak only of the mess when heidegger and sartre speak of a contrast between be and existence they may be right i don t know but their language be too philosophical for me i be not a philosopher one can only speak of what be in front of him and that now be simply the mess then he begin to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form until recently art have withstand the pressure of chaotic thing it have hold them at bay it realize that to admit them be to jeopardize form how could the mess be admit because it appear to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art hold itself to be but now we can keep it out no long because we have come into a time when it invade our experience at every moment it be there and it must be allow in i grant this might be so but find the result to be even more attention to form than be the case previously and why not how i ask could chaos be admit to chaos would not that be the end of think and the end of art if we look at recent art we find it preoccupy with form beckett s own work be an example play more highly formalize than wait for godot endgame and krapp s last tape would be hard to find what i be say do not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art it only mean that there will be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admit the chaos and do not try to say that the chaos be really something else the form and the chaos remain separate the latter be not reduce to the former that be why the form itself become a preoccupation because it exist a a problem separate from the material it accommodate to find a form that accommodate the mess that be the task of the artist now yet i respond could not similar thing be say about the art of the past be it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confront u with something we can not clarify demand that the viewer respond to it in his own never predictable way what be the history of criticism but the history of men attempt to make sense of the manifold element in art that will not allow themselves to be reduce to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory isn t all art ambiguous not this he say and gesture toward the madeleine the classical line of the church which napoleon think of a a temple of glory dominate all the scene where we sit the boulevard de la madeleine the boulevard malesherbes and the rue royale run to it with graceful flattery bear tide of the age of reason not this this be clear this do not allow the mystery to invade u with classical art all be settle but it be different at chartres there be the unexplainable and there art raise question that it do not attempt to answer i ask about the battle between life and death in his play didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide hamm s world be death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the live child outside be this life death question a part of the chaos yes if life and death do not both present themselves to u there would be no inscrutability if there be only darkness all would be clear it be because there be not only darkness but also light that our situation become inexplicable take augustine s doctrine of grace give and grace withhold have you ponder the dramatic quality in this theology two thief be crucify with christ one save and the other damned how can we make sense of this division in classical drama such problem do not arise the destiny of racine s phedre be seal from the begin she will proceed into the dark a she go she herself will be illuminate at the begin of the play she have partial illumination and at the end she have complete illumination but there have be no question but that she move toward the dark that be the play within this notion clarity be possible but for u who be neither greek nor jansenist there be not such clarity the question would also be remove if we believe in the contrary total salvation but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable the key word in my play be perhaps give a theological lead i ask what he think about those who find a religious significance to his play well really there be none at all i have no religious feel once i have a religious emotion it be at my first communion no more my mother be deeply religious so be my brother he kneel down at his bed a long a he could kneel my father have none the family be protestant but for me it be only irksome and i let it go my brother and mother get no value from their religion when they die at the moment of crisis it have no more depth than an old school tie irish catholicism be not attractive but it be deep when you pass a church on an irish bus all the hand flurry in the sign of the cross one day the dog of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pig but do the play deal with the same facet of experience religion must also deal with yes for they deal with distress some people object to this in my write at a party an english intellectual so call ask me why i write always about distress a if it be perverse to do so he want to know if my father have beat me or my mother have run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood i tell him no that i have have a very happy childhood then he think me more perverse than ever i leave the party a soon a possible and get into a taxi on the glass partition between me and the driver be three sign one ask for help for the blind another help for orphan and the third for relief for the war refugee one do not have to look for distress it be scream at you even in the taxi of london lunch be over and we walk back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris scream at u the personal quality of samuel beckett be similar to quality i have find in the play he say nothing that compress experience within a close pattern perhaps stand in place of commitment at the same time he be plainly sympathetic clearly friendly if there be only the mess all would be clear but there be also compassion a a christian i know i do not stand where beckett stand but i do see much of what he see a a writer on the theater i have pay close attention to the play harold clurman be right to say that wait for godot be a reflection he call it a distort reflection of the impasse and disarray of europe s present politics ethic and common way of life yet it be not only europe the play refer to wait for godot sell even well in america than in france the consciousness it mirror may have come early to europe than to america but it be the consciousness that most mature society arrive at when their success in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examine the not strictly practical end of culture america be now join europe in this mature phase of development whether any of u remain in it long will depend on what happen a a result of the technological and economic revolution now go on in the country of asia and africa and also of course on how long the cold war remain cold

cg15,cg15,informative,lettres,2514,it be worth dwell in some detail on the crisis of this story because it bring together a number of characteristic element and make of them a curious riddle compound obscurely but centrally significant for mann s work the wife amra and her lover be both savagely portray she a incarnate sensuality voluptuous and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity her birdlike brain lautner for his part belong to the present day race of small artist who do not demand the utmost of themselves and the bitter description of the type include such epithet a wretched little poseur the devastate indictment they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat extreme prophecy so far not fulfil they will be destroy the trick these two play upon jacoby reveal their want not simply of decency but of imagination a well his appearance a lizzy evoke not amusement but horror in the audience it be a spectacle absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffer flesh unredeemed by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation at the same time the multiple transvestitism involve the fat man a girl and a baby a coquette pretend to be a baby touch for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret source of a life like jacoby s upon the sinister dream which form the source of any human life the music which lautner have compose for this episode be for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal but it be characteristic of him we be tell his little artifice to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art and this occur now at the refrain of jacoby s song at the point in fact of the name lizzy a modulation describe a almost a stroke of genius a miracle a revelation it be like a curtain suddenly tear away to reveal something nude it be this modulation which reveal to jacoby his own frightful abjection and simultaneously his wife s infidelity by the same mean he perceive this fact a have communicate itself to the audience he collapse and die in the work of every artist i suppose there may be find one or more moment which strike the student a absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it be all about not less strikingly so for be mysterious a though some deeply hide constatation of thought be encipher in a single image a single moment so here the horrify humor the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke go wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dress up a a whore dress up a a baby the epiphany of that quiver flesh the bring together around it of the secret liaison between indolent mindless sensuality and sharp shrewd talent cleverness with an occasional touch of genius which however do not know how to attack the problem of suffer the miraculous way in which music revelation and death be associate in a single instant all this seem a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself beyond itself also it evoke numerous and distant resonance from the entire body of mann s work when i try to work out my reason for feel that this passage be of critical significance i come up with the follow idea which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a late essay love be the crucial dilemma of experience for mann s hero the dramatic construction of his story characteristically turn on a situation in which someone be simultaneously compel and forbid to love the release the freedom involve in love another be either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible and the motion toward it bring disaster this prohibition on love have an especially poignant relation to art it be particularly the artist tonio kroger aschenbach leverkuhn who suffer from it the specific analogy to the dilemma of love be the problem of the breakthrough in the realm of art again the suffer and disaster produce by any transgression against the commandment not to love be almost invariably associate in one way or another with childhood with the figure of a child finally the theatrical and perversely erotic notion of dress up cosmetic disguise and especially change of costume or singularity of costume a with cipolla be characteristically associate with the catastrophe of mann s story we shall return to these statement and deal with them more fully a the evidence for them accumulate for the present it be enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these element come together in prophetic parody professionally a lawyer that be to say associate with dignity reserve discipline with much that be essentially middle class he be compel by an impossible love to exhibit himself dress up disguise that be paradoxically reveal a a child and bad a a whore masquerade a a child that this abandonment take place on a stage during an artistic performance be enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art that be he be suspect guilty punishable a be anyone in mann s story who produce illusion and this be true even though the constant element of the artist nature technique magic guilt and suffer be divide in this story between jacoby and lautner it appear that the dominant tendency of mann s early tale however pictorial or even picturesque the surface be already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his story be one and the same something of this can be learn from the way to the churchyard an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a pass cyclist cause him to die of a stroke or seizure there be no more plot than that only slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident would give the artistic interest then lie in what the encounter may be make to represent in the power of some central significance to draw the detail into relevance and meaningfulness the first sentence with it platitudinous irony announce an emblematic intent the way to the churchyard run along beside the highroad run beside it all the way to the end that be to say to the churchyard and the action be consistently present with regard for this distinction the highroad one might say at first belong to life while the way to the churchyard belong to death but that be too simple and win t hold up a the first sentence suggest both road belong to death in the end but the highroad accord to the description of it traffic belong to life a it be live in unawareness of death while the way to the churchyard belong to some other sort of life a suffer form an existence wholly comprise in the awareness of death thus on the highroad a troop of soldier march in their own dust and sing while on the footpath one man walk alone this man s isolation be not merely momentary it be permanent he be a widower his three child be dead he have no one leave on earth also he be a drink and have lose his job on that account his name be praisegod piepsam and he be rather fully describe a to his clothe and physiognomy in a way which relate him to a sinister type in the author s repertory he be a forerunner of those enigmatic stranger in death in venice for example who represent some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp this strange person quarrel with a cyclist because the latter be use the path rather than the highroad the cyclist a sufficiently commonplace young fellow be not name but identify simply a life that and a license number which piepsam us in address him life point out that everybody us this path and start to ride on piepsam try to stop him by force receive a push in the chest from life and be leave stand in impotent and grow rage while a crowd begin to gather his rage assume a religious form that be on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness piepsam become a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecate doom on life not only the cyclist now but the audience the world a well all you light head breed this passion bring on a fit which prove fatal then an ambulance come along and they drive praisegod piepsam away this be simple enough but several more point of interest may be mention a relevant the season between spring and summer belong to life in it carefree aspect piepsam s fatal rage arise not only because he can not stop the cyclist but also because god will not stop him a piepsam say to the crowd in his last moment his justice be not of this world life be far characterize in antithesis to piepsam a animal the image of a dog which appear at several place be first give a the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest arouse by life consider simply a a spectacle a dog in a wagon be admirable a pleasure to contemplate another wagon have no dog and therefore be devoid of interest piepsam call the cyclist cur and puppy among other thing and at the crisis of his fit a little fox terrier stand before him and howl into his face the ambulance be draw by two charm little horse piepsam be not certainly religious in any conventional sense his religiousness be intimately or dialectically connect with his sinfulness the two may in fact be identical his unsuccessful strive to give up drink be represent a religious strive he keep a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe praisegod piepsam have before now go literally on his knee and in his wrestle have bite his tongue and still in the end capitulate the cyclist by contrast blond and blue eye be simply unreflective unproblematic life blithe and carefree he make no claim to belong to the great and mighty of this earth piepsam be grotesque a disturb parody his end be ridiculous and trivial he be a man rave mad on the way to the churchyard but he be more interest than the others the one who come from the highroad to watch him more interest than life consider a a cyclist and if i have go into so much detail about so small a work that be because it be also so typical a work represent the germinal form of a conflict which remain essential in mann s write the crude sketch of piepsam contain in it critical destructive and self destructive tendency much that be enlarge and illuminate in the figure of for instance naphta and leverkuhn in method a well a in theme this little anecdote with it detail select a much for expressiveness and allegory a for realism anticipate a kind of musical composition a well a a kind of fictional composition in which a leverkuhn say there shall be nothing unthematic it resemble too picture such a durer and bruegel do in which all that look at first to be solely pictorial prove on inspection to be also literary the representation of a proverb for example or a deadly sin gladius dei resemble the way to the churchyard in it representation of a conflict between light and dark between life and a spirit of criticism negation melancholy but it go considerably far in characterize the element of this conflict the monk savonarola bring over from the renaissance and place against the background of munich at the turn of the century protest against the luxurious work display in the art shop of m bluthenzweig in particular against a madonna portray in a voluptuous style and model accord to gossip upon the painter s mistress hieronymus like piepsam make his protest quite in vain and his rejection though not fatal be ridiculous and humiliate he be simply throw out of the shop by the porter on the street outside hieronymus envision a holocaust of the vanity of this world such a burn of artistic and erotic production a his namesake actually bring to pass in florence and prophetically he issue his curse gladius dei super terram cito et velociter
cg16,cg16,informative,lettres,2226,the reality to which they respond be rationally empty and their art be an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world their artistic rationale be give to the witness of unreason these polar concern imitation v formalism reflect a philosophical and religious situation which have be develop over a long period of time the breakdown of classical structure of mean in all realm of western culture have give rise to several generation of artist who have document the disintegrative process thus the image of man have suffer complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual quality and complete objectification in sub human and quasi mechanistic power the image of the world tend to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty space and overwhelm mystery the image of god have simply disappear all such imitation of negative quality have give rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism if man can neither know nor love reality a it be he can at least invent an artistic reality which be it own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective quality capable of be know and worthy of be love the person of the artist become a final bastion of mean in a world render meaningless by the march of event and the decay of classical religious and philosophical system whatever pole of this contrast one emphasize and whatever the tension between these two approach to understand the artistic imagination it will be readily see that they be not mutually exclusive that they belong together without the decay of a sense of objective reference except a the imitation of mystery the stress on subjective invention would never have be stimulate into be and although these insight into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art their peculiar authenticity in this day and age require that they be take seriously and give promise that from their very substance new and valid chapter in the philosophy of art may be write for well or bad we can not regard imitation in the art in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detach realism a broad concept of imitation be need one which acknowledge that true invention be important that the artist s creativity in part transcend the non artistic causal factor out of which it arise on the other hand we can not regard artistic invention a pure uncaused and unrelated to the time in which it occur we need a doctrine of imitation to save u from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism accordingly it be the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from early theory of imitation and a new theory of invention which i shall call symbol for reason to be state hereafter the mimetic imagination in the art the word mimesis imitation be usually associate with plato and aristotle for plato imitation be twice remove from reality be a poor copy of physical appearance which in itself be a poor copy of ideal essence all artistic and mythological representation therefore be imitation of imitation and be completely supersede by the truth value of dialectic the proper use of the inquire intellect in plato s judgment the art play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young prior to the full development of their intellectual power presuppose in plato s system be a doctrine of level of insight in which a certain kind of detach understand be alone capable of penetrate to the most sublime wisdom aristotle also tend to stratify all aspect of human nature and activity into level of excellence and like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level the poetics in affirm that all human art be mode of imitation give a more serious role to artistic mimesis than do plato but aristotle keep the principle of level and even augment it by describe in the poetics what kind of character and action must be imitate if the play be to be a vehicle of serious and important human truth for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis in contrast to the power of dialectic be relatively incapable of express the character of fundamental reality the central concern of erich auerbach s impressive volume call mimesis be to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation base upon a recognition of level of truth to a christian theory of imitation in which the level be dissolve follow the theme of incarnation in the gospel the christian artist and critic see in the most commonplace and ordinary event figure of divine power and reality here artistic realism involve the audience in an impassioned participation in event whose overtone and implication be transcendent artistic mimesis under christian influence record the involvement of all person however humble in a divine drama the artist unlike the philosopher be not a remove observer aim at neutral and rarified high level of abstraction he be the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he have be grasp i have chosen to use the word mimesis in it christian rather than it classic implication and to discover in the concrete form of both art and myth power of theological expression which a in the christian mind be the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience which be not reserve a in the greek mind only to moment of theoretical reflection in the first instance mimesis be here use to mean the recall of experience in term of vivid image rather than in term of abstract idea or conventional designation by image be mean not only a visual presentation but also remember sensation of any of the five sens plus the feel which be immediately conjoin therewith this be the primary function of the imagination operate in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the image be first appropriate mimesis be the near possible thing to the actual re live of experience in which the imagine person recover through image something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself the image themselves like their counterpart in experience be not neutral quality to be survey dispassionately they be field of force exert a unique influence on the sensibility and a unique relatedness to one another they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves with attraction and repulsion native to their own quality a in experience one be seize by give entity and their interrelation and be force to respond in value feel to them so one be similarly seize in the mimetic presentation of image mimesis here be not to be confuse with literalism or realism in the conventional sense a word take in it dictionary mean a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picturing of a scene tend to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstraction a to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feel similarly experience itself can be conventionalize so that people react to certain preconceive clue for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field a truly vivid imagination move beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tend to express itself in the presentation of artistic form and material when word can be use in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sight and sound when tone of sound and color of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibility with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves compel the observer into an attitude of attention all this imitate the way experience itself in it deep character strike upon the door of consciousness and clamor for entrance these be like the initial way in which the world force itself upon the self and thrust the self into decision and choice the presence of genuine mimesis in art be mark by the persistence with which the work demand attention and compel valuation even though it be but vaguely understand underlie these conception of mimesis be certain presupposition concern the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed experience be not see a it be in classical rationalism a present u initially with clear and distinct object simply locate in space and register their character movement and change on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect neither be primary experience understand accord to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing be think to be receive other than signal of sensory quality produce their response in the appropriate sense

be data of a self involve in environ process and power the most primitive feel be rudimentary value feel both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into

large arena of power which have a long past than our own which be interrelate in a vast movement through the present toward the future we feel the quality of these power initially a in some degree wholesome or threaten late abstractive and rational process may indicate error of judgment in these apprehension of value but the apprehension themselves be the primary stuff of experience it take a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of large unity of power and influence and to view one s world simply a a collection of sense data arrange in such and such sequence and pattern devoid of all power to move the feel and action except in so far a they present themselves for inspection whitehead be here question david hume s understand of the nature of experience he be question also every epistemology which stem from hume s presupposition that experience be merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy and that causal efficacy be something intellectually impute to the world not directly perceive what hume call sensation be what whitehead call perception in the mode of presentational immediacy which be a sophisticate abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy a long a perception be see a compose only of isolate sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence lose it objectivity become an invention of consciousness and the result be a philosophical scepticism whitehead contend that the human way of understand existence a a unity of interlock and interdependent process which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be be possible only because the basic form of such an understand for all it vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail be initially give in the

that be that the contribution to the general church expense the dollar money have be seriously fall behind in this church and that must be look after immediately in fact he intimate clearly that that be the reason that wilson have be send here to make a large contribution of dollar money wilson stress the fact that clear a this be they must have a well church a more business like conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of it rut of wild worship into a modern church organization he emphasize to the preside elder the plan of give up the old church and move across the river the preside elder be sure that that would be impossible but he tell wilson to go ahead and try and wilson try it do seem impossible the bank which hold the mortgage on the old church declare that the interest be considerably in arrears and the real estate people say flatly that the land across the river be be hold for an eventual development for white work people who be come in and that none would be sell to color folk when it be propose to rebuild the church wilson find that the term for a new mortgage be very high he be sure that he could do well if he go to atlanta to get the deal finance but when this proposal be make to his deacon board he meet unanimous opposition the church certainly would not be remove the very proposition be sacrilege it have be here fifty year it be go to stay forever it be hardly possible to get any argument on the subject a for rebuilding well that might be look into but there be no hurry no hurry at all wilson again go downtown to a different banker an intelligent young white man who seem rather sympathetic but he shake his head reverend he say i think you don t quite understand the situation here don t you see the amount of money that have be invest by white around that church tenement store saloon some gamble i hope not too much the color people be get employment at kent house and other place and they be near their place of employment when a city have arrange thing like this you can not easily change them now if i be you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten year by that time perhaps something well can be do then wilson ask what about this kent house which you mention i don t understand why a white hotel should be down here the young banker look at him with a certain surprise and then he say flatly i m afraid i can t tell you anything in particular about kent house you ll have to find out about it on your own hope to see you again and he dismiss the color pastor it be next day that sojourner come and sit beside him and take his hand she say my dear do you know what kent house be no say wilson i don t i be just ask about it what be it it s a house of prostitution for white men with white girl a inmate they hire a good deal of local labor include two member of our trustee board they buy some supply from our color grocer and they be patronize by some of the best white gentleman in town wilson star at her my dear you must be mistake talk to mr catt she say and after wilson have talk to mr catt and to others he be absolutely amaze this of course be the sort of thing that use to take place in southern city put white house of prostitution with color girl in color neighborhood and carry them on openly but it have largely disappear on account of protest by the white and through grow resentment on the part of the negro a they become more educate and get well wage but this situation of kent house be more subtle the wage involve be large and more regular the inmate be white and from out of town avoid local friction the back from the white town be great and there be little publicity good wage patronage and subscription of various kind stop open protest from negro and yet wilson know that this place must go or he must go and for him to leave this job now without accomplish anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not in all church

ever since he have first begin to study music and to teach it rousseau have dream of pierce through to fame a the result of a successful opera but his facility in this genre be not great and his effort to get a performance for his gallant mus invariably fail and for good reason his operatic music have little merit but then one day while on a week s visit to the country home of a retire swiss jeweler rousseau amuse the company with a few little melody he have write to which he attach no great importance he be really amaze to discover the other guest so excite about these delicate little song put a few such song together they urge him string them onto some sort of little plot and you ll have a delightful operetta he didn t believe them nonsense he say this be the sort of stuff i write and then throw away heaven forbid cry the lady enchant by his music you must make an opera out of this material and they wouldn t leave off argue and plead until he have promise oh the irony and the bitterness of it that after all his year of effort to become a composer he should now now when he be still stoutly reply to the critic of his discourse on the art and science be so close to a success in music and have to reject it or at least appear to reject it but what else could he do you couldn t on the one hand decry the art and at the same time practice them could you well yes perhaps in literature since you could argue that you couldn t keep silent about your feel against literature and so be involve in spite of yourself but now music too no that would be too much and the fault of course be rameau s the fault be rameau s and that of the whole culture of this parisian age for it be rameau s type of music that he have be try to write and that he couldn t write these little song however be sweet nothing from the heart tender memory of his childhood little melody that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep but no he couldn t appear a a composer now that glory crave for so long be now forbid to him still just for the lady and just for this once for this one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his melody the lady be delight and jean jacques be applaud and everyone go to work to learn the part which he write but then after the little operetta have be give it feeble amateur render everyone insist that it be too good to be lose forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first rate performance it merit rousseau be aware that he must seem like a hypocrite stand there and argue that he could not possibly permit a public performance the lady especially couldn t understand what trouble him a contradiction bah what be a contradiction in one s life every woman have have the experience of say no when she mean yes and say yes when she mean no rousseau have to admit that though he couldn t agree to a public performance he would indeed just for his own private satisfaction dearly love to know how his work would sound when do by professional musician and by train voice i d simply like to know if it be a good a you kind people seem to think he say duclos the historian point out to jean jacques that this be impossible the musician of the royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound merely to satisfy the author s curiosity rousseau agree but he recall that rameau have once have a private performance of his opera armide behind close door just for himself alone duclos understand what be bother rousseau that the writer of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become know a the writer of an amuse little operetta that would certainly be paradoxical but duclos think he saw a way out let me do the submit to the royal academy he suggest your name will never appear no one will even suspect that it be your work to that rousseau could agree but now what crazy twist and turn of his emotion afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turn down which would be a blow to his pride even though no one know he be the author and that the work would be accept and then that his violent feel in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concern he be in spite of himself and how anxious this lover of obscurity be for applause and thus tear between his desire to be know a the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remain true to his proclaim desire for anonymity rousseau suffer through several painful week all these emotion be screw up to new height when after acceptance and the first rehearsal there ensue such a buzz of excitement among parisian music lover that duclos have to come run to rousseau to inform him that the news have reach the superintendent of the king s amusement and that he be now demand that the work be offer first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau imagine the honor of it what be your answer jean jacques ask strive to appear unimpressed i refuse duclos say what else could i do monsieur de cury be incense of course but i say i would first have to get the author s permission and i be certain he would refuse how infuriate all this be why have not this success come to him before he have plunge into his discourse and before he have commit himself to a life of austerity and denial now when everything be opening up to him even the court of louis he have to play a role of self effacement back and forth duclos have to go between m de cury and jean jacques and between the duke d aumont and jean jacques again a his little operetta the village soothsayer though still unperformed take on ever more importance and of course the news of who the composer be do finally begin to get around among his close friend but they naturally keep his secret well and the public at large know only of a great excitement in musical and court circle how titillate it be to go among people who do not know him a the composer but who talk in the most glow term of the promise of the piece after have hear the first rehearsal the furor be such that people who could not possibly have squirm their way into the rehearsal be pretend that they be intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational and listen to such a conversation one morning while take a cup of chocolate in a cafe rousseau find himself bath in perspiration trembling lest his authorship become know and at the same time dreaming of the startle effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly a the composer he felt himself now a he himself say in his confession at a crucial point of his life and that be why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal stable call to take him to the palace he do not bother to shave on the contrary he be please that his face show a neglect of several day see him in that condition and about to enter the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all the member of the high aristocracy would be present grimm and the abbe raynal and others try to stop him you can t go in that way they cry why not jean jacques ask who be go to stop me you haven t dress for the occasion they point out to him i m dress a i always be rousseau say neither well nor bad at home yes they argue but here you be in the palace there s the king and madame de pompadour if they be here then surely i have the right to be here rousseau say and even more right since i be the composer but in such a slovenly condition what be slovenly about me rousseau ask be it because of my slovenliness that hair grow on my face surely it would grow there whether i wash myself or not a hundred year ago i would have wear a beard with pride and those without beard would have stand out a not dress for the occasion now time have change and i must pretend that hair doesn t grow on my face that s the fashion and fashion be the real king here not louis since even he obey now if you don t mind i should like to hear my own piece perform but of course behind his boldness he didn t feel bold at all he tremble lest his piece should fail and this in addition to his usual fear of be among people of high society his fear of make some inane or inappropriate remark and even deep than that his fear lest in this close hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself could he walk out in the midst of his piece here before the court before the king
ck09,ck09,imaginative,fiction,2281,it be the first time any of u have laugh since the morning begin the rider from concord be a good a his word he come spur and whoop down the road his horse kick up cloud of dust shout they re a come by god they re a come they be we hear him before he ever show and we hear him yell after he be out of sight solomon chandler hadn t misjudge the strength of his lung not at all i think you could have hear him a mile away and he be burst at every seam with importance i have observe that be up on a horse change the whole character of a man and when a very small man be up on a saddle he d like a not prefer to eat his meal there that s understandable and i appreciate the sentiment a for this rider i never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismount so whether he stand tall or short in his shoe i can t say but i do know that he give the day tone and distinction the last thing in the world that resemble a war be our line of farmer and storekeeper and mechanic perch on top of a stone wall and this dash rider make u feel a good deal sharp and more alert to the situation we come down off the wall a if he have topple all of u and we crouch behind it i have hear people talk with contempt about the british regular but that only prove that a lot of people talk about thing of which they be deplorably ignorant whatever we felt about the redcoat we respect them in term of their trade which be kill and i know that i myself be nauseate with apprehension and fear and that my hand be soak wet where they hold my gun i want to wipe my flint but i didn t dare to the state my hand be in just a i didn t dare to do anything about the prim the gun would fire or not just a chance will i put a lot more trust in my two leg than in the gun because the most important thing i have learn about war be that you could run away and survive to talk about it the gunfire which be so near that it seem just a piece up the road now stop for long enough to count to twenty and in that brief interval a redcoat officer come tear down the road whip his horse fit to kill i don t know whether he be after our rider who have go by a minute before or whether he be simply scouting condition but when he pass u by a musket roar and he rear his horse swing it around and begin to whip it back in the direction from which he have come he be a fine and showy rider but his skill be waste on u from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle crack the redcoat officer collapse like a puncture bolster and the horse rear and throw him from the saddle except that one boot foot catch in the stirrup half craze by the weight drag the dust and the heat the horse leap our wall dash out the rider s brain against it and leave him lie there among u while the horse crash away through the brush it be my initiation to war and the insane symphony war play for what have happen on the common be only terror and flight but this grinning break head not ten foot away from me be the sharp definition of what my reality have become and now the redcoat be come and the gunfire be a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of u i must state that the fast thing happen the slow they happen the passage and rhythm of time change and when i remember back to what happen then each event be a separate and freeze incident in my recollection there be a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreat redcoat and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seem to hover indefinitely yet it could not have be more than a matter of second and then the front of the british army come into view it be only hour since i have last see them but they have change and i have change in the very front rank two men be wound and stagger along trail blood behind them no drummer here no piper and the red coat be cover with a fine film of dust they march with bayonet fix and a fix on their face be anger fear and torment rank after rank of them come down the road and the face be all the same and they walk in a sea of dust committeeman hold your fire hold your fire a voice call and what make it even more terrible and unreal be that the redcoat rank never pause for an instant only some of them glance toward the stone wall from behind which the voice come the front of their column have already pass u when another officer come rid down the side of the road not five pace from where we be my cousin simmons carry a musket but he have load it with bird shoot and a the officer come opposite him he rise up behind the wall and fire one moment there be a man in the saddle the next a headless horror on a horse that bolt through the redcoat rank and during the next second or two we all of u fire into the suddenly disorganize column of soldier one moment the road be fill with discipline troop march four by four with a purpose a implacable a death the next a cloud of gun smoke cover a scream fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldier emerge with their bayonet and their curse fury in the course of this they have fire on u but i have no memory of that i have squeeze the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it have fire and kick back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule and then i be add my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurl more vile language than i ever think i know sobbing and shout and aware that if i have pass water before it be not enough for my pant be soak wet i would have stand there and die there if leave to myself but cousin simmons grab my arm in his viselike grip and fairly pluck me out of there and then i come to some sanity and plunge away with such extraordinary speed that i outdistance cousin simmons by far everyone else be run late we realize that the redcoat have stop their charge at the wall their only hope of survival be to hold to the road and keep march we tumble to a stop in deacon gordon s cow hole a low lie bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in it middle a dozen cow moo sadly and regard u a if we be insane a perhaps we be at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter the yell and shoot still continue up at the road and the thirst of some of the men which be so great that they wad into the muddy water and scoop up handful of it isaac pitt one of the men from lincoln have take a musket ball in his belly and though he have find the strength to run with u now he collapse and lay on the grind die the reverend hold his head and wipe his hot brow it may appear that we be cruel and callous but no one have time to spend sympathize with poor isaac except the reverend i know that i myself felt that it be a mortal shame for a man to be tear open by a british musket ball a isaac have be yet i also felt relieve and lucky that it have be him and not myself i be drink with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that come float down from the road and the fact that i be not afraid now but only wait to know what to do next meanwhile i reload my gun a the other men be do we be less than a quarter of a mile from the road and we could trace it shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hang over it wherever you look you saw committeeman run across the meadow some away from the road some toward it some parallel to it and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia be make their way in our direction cousin joshua and some others felt that we should march toward lexington and take up new position ahead of the slow move british column but another group maintain that we should stick to this spot and this section of road i didn t offer any advice but i certainly do not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brain dash out someone say that while we be stand here and argue about it the british would be go but cousin simmons say he have watch them march west early in the morning and move at a much brisker pace it have still take half an hour for their column to pass what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition cart while this be be discuss we saw the militia to the west of u fan out and break into little cluster of two and three men a they approach the road it be the opinion of some of u that these must be part of the committeeman who have be in the battle of the north bridge which entitle them to a sort of veteran status and we felt that if they employ this tactic it be likely enough the best one mattathias dover say it make sense if we cluster together the redcoat can make an advantage out of it but there s not a bless thing they can do with two or three of u except chase u and we can outrun them that settle it and we break into party of two and three cousin joshua dover decide to remain with the reverend and poor isaac pitt until life pass away and he be hurt so badly he do not seem for long in this world i go off with cousin simmons who maintain that if he didn t see to me he didn t know who would good heaven adam he say i think one thing you d have no trouble learn be when to get out of a place i learn that now i say we run east for about half a mile before we turn back to the road panting from the effort and soak with sweat there be a clump of tree that appear to provide cover right up to the road and the shout and gunfire never slacken under the tree there be a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimple who have take a rifle ball directly between the eye three men be around him they have strip him of his musket and equipment and now they be pull his boot and jacket off cousin simmons grab one of them by the shoulder and fling him away god s name what be you to rob the dead with the fight go on cousin simmons roar they try to outface him but joseph simmons be a wide a two average men and it would have take brave men than these be to outface him

moment when mary could have be alone with jesus mostly the scene be crowd with mourner such a the dramatic dell arca lamentation in bologna where the grief stricken spectator have usurp mary s last poignant moment in his concept there could be no one else present his first desire be to create a mother and son alone in the universe when might mary have have that moment to hold her child on her

home to mourn those who saw his finish pieta would take the place of the biblical witness they would feel what mary be undergo there would be no halo no angel these would be two human be whom god have chosen he felt close to mary have spend so long concentrate on the begin of her journey now she be intensely alive anguish her son be dead even though he would late be resurrect he be at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflect what he have go through on the cross in his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt for his mother only what mary felt for her son jesus inert body would be passive his eye close mary would have to carry the human communication this seem right to him it be a relief to shift in his mind to technical problem since his christ be to be life size how be mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seem ungainly his mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full grow man a securely and convincingly a she would a child there be only one way to accomplish this by design by draw diagram and sketch in which he probe the remote corner of his mind for creative idea to carry his concept he start by make free sketch to loosen up his think so that image would appear on paper visually these approximate what he be feel within himself at the same time he start walk the street peer at the people pass or shop at the stall store up fresh impression of what they look like how they move in particular he seek the gentle sweet face nun with head cover and veil come to the middle of their forehead remember their expression until he reach home and set them down on paper discover that drapery could be design to serve structural purpose he begin a study of the anatomy of fold he improvise a he go along complete a life size clay figure then buy yard of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and cover it over with clay that argiento bring from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick mud no fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery have to serve organically to cover the madonna s slender leg and foot so that they would give substantive support to christ s body to intensify her inner turmoil when the cloth dry and stiffen he saw what adjustment have to be make so that s sculpture comment argiento wryly when he have sluice down the floor for a week make mud pie michelangelo grin see argiento if you control the way these fold be bunch like this or make to flow you can enrich the body attitude they can have a much tactile appeal a flesh and bone he go into the jewish quarter want to draw hebraic face so that he could reach a visual understand of how christ might have look the jewish section be in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa the colony have be small until the spanish inquisition of drive many jew into rome here for the most part they be well treat a a reminder of the old testament heritage of christianity many of their gift member be prominent in the vatican a physician musician banker the men do not object to his sketch them while they go about their work but no one could be persuade to come to his studio to pose he be tell to ask for rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon michelangelo find the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eye rob in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head he be read from the talmud with a group of men from his congregation when michelangelo explain why he have come rabbi melzi reply gravely the bible forbid u to bow down to or to make grave image that be why our creative people give their time to literature not to painting or sculpture but rabbi melzi you don t object to others create work of art not at all each religion have it own tenet i be carving a pieta from white carrara marble i wish to make jesus an authentic jew i can not accomplish this if you will not help me the rabbi say thoughtfully i would not want my people to get in trouble with the church i be work for the cardinal of san dionigi i m sure he would approve what kind of model would you prefer workman in their mid thirty not bulky laborer but sinewy men with intelligence and sensitivity rabbi melzi smile at him with infinitely old but merry eye leave me your address i will send you the best the quarter have to offer michelangelo hurry to sangallo s solitary bachelor room with his sketch ask the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seat madonna sangallo study the draw and improvise a trestle couch michelangelo buy some scrap lumber together he and argiento build the stand cover it with blanket his first model arrive at dusk he hesitate for a moment when michelangelo ask him to disrobe so michelangelo give him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loin lead him to the kitchen to take off his clothe he then drape him over the rough stand explain that he be suppose to be recently dead and be be hold on his mother s lap the model quite plainly think michelangelo crazy only the instruction from his rabbi keep him from bolt but at the end of the sit when michelangelo show him the quick free draw with the mother rough in hold her son the model grasp what michelangelo be after and promise to speak to his friend he work for two hour a day with each model send by the rabbi mary present quite a different problem though this sculpture must take place thirty three year after her moment of decision he could not conceive of her a a woman in her mid fifty old wrinkle break in body and face by labor or worry his image of the virgin have always be that of a young woman even a have his memory of his mother jacopo galli introduce him into several roman home here he sketch sit in their flow gown of linen and silk young girl not yet twenty some about to be marry some marry a year or two since the santo spirito hospital have take only men he have have no experience in the study of female anatomy but he have sketch the woman of tuscany in their field and home he be able to discern the body line of the roman woman under their rob he spend concentrate week put his two figure together a mary who would be young and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap and a jesus who though lean be strong even in death a look he remember well from his experience in the dead room of santo spirito he draw toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory without need to consult his sketch soon he be ready to go into a three dimensional figure in clay here he would have free expression because the material could be move to distort form when he want to emphasize or get great intensity he add or subtract clay next he turn to wax because there be a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence he respect each of these approach technique and keep them in character his quill draw have a scratchiness suggest skin texture the clay he use plastically to suggest soft move flesh a in an abdomen in a recline torso the wax he smooth over to give the body surface an elastic pull yet he never allow these model to become fix in his mind they remain rough start point when carving he be charge with spontaneous energy too careful or detail study in clay and wax would have glue him down to a mere enlarge of his model the true surge have to be inside the marble itself draw and model be his think carving be action the arrangement with argiento be work well except that sometimes michelangelo could not figure who be master and who apprentice argiento have be train so rigorously by the jesuit that michelangelo be unable to change his habit up before dawn to scrub the floor whether they be dirty or not water boil on the fire for wash laundry every day the pot scour with river sand after each meal argiento this be senseless he complain not like to work on the wet floor particularly in cold weather you re too clean scrub the studio once a week that s enough no say argiento stolidly every day before dawn i be teach and god help anyone who try to unteach you

afflict eye at dawn argiento go to jacopo galli galli arrive with his family surgeon maestro lippi the surgeon carry a cage of live pigeon he tell argiento to take a bird out of the cage cut a large

ck19,ck19,imaginative,fiction,2345,there be one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which he could not deny a long a there be two human be work together on the same project there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave no matter how devote a man be no matter how fully he give his life to the lord he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that give him definition a an individual all of the job in the mission might be equal in the eye of the lord but they be certainly not equal in the eye of the lord s servant it be only natural that fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decision even rector himself be prey to this spirit of competition and he know it not for a more exalt office in the hierarchy of the church his ambition for the bishopry have die very early in his career but for the one clear victory he have talk about to the colonel he be not sure how much of this desire be due to his devotion to the church and how much be his own ego demand to be satisfy for the two be intertwine and could not be separate he want desperately to see kayabashi defeat the communist in the village root out the mission stand triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant too but perhaps this be a part of the eternal plan that man s ambition when link with god would be a drive indefatigable force for good in the world he sigh how foolish it be to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice he would have to work without question the motif which make him work and content himself with the think that the eventual victory however it be bring about would be sweet indeed his first move be to send hino to the village to spend a few day his arm have be give him some trouble and rector be not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it have heal improperly or whether hino be simply rebel against the tedious work in the print shop use the stiffness in his arm a an excuse in any event rector send him to the local hospital to have it check tell him to keep his ear open while he be in the village to see if he could find out what kayabashi be plan hino be elate at the prospect he be allow to spend his night at an inn near the hospital and he be give some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor an excellent place to make contact with the enemy he leave with all the joyous spirit of a child go on a holiday nod attentively a rector give him his final instruction he be to get involve in no argument he be to try to make no convert he be simply to listen and report back what he hear it be a ridiculous situation and rector know it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious would make a poor espionage agent if he want to know anything he would end up ask about it point blank but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answer than if he try to get them by indirection in all of his experience in the mission field rector have never see a convert quite like hino from the moment that hino have first walk into the mission to ask for a job any job his qualification neatly write on a piece of paper in a precise hand he have be ready to become a christian he have already be study the bible he know the fundamental and after study with fletcher for a time he approach rector announce that he want to be baptize and that be that rector have never be able to find out much about hino s past hino talk very little about himself except for the infrequent time when he use a personal illustration in connection with another subject put the piece of this mosaic together rector have the vague outline of a biography hino be the fourth son of an elderly farmer who live on the coast in chiba and divide his life between the land and the sea supplement the marginal livelihood on his small rent farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat without exception hino s brother turn to either one or both of their father s occupation but hino show a talent for neither and instead spend most of his time on the beach where he repair net and prove immensely popular a a storyteller he have go into the japanese navy have be train a an officer have participate in one or two battle he never go into detail regard his military experience and at the age of twenty five quite a a bolt out of the blue he have walk into the mission a if he belong here and have become a christian rector be often curious often tempt to ask question but he never do if and when hino decide to tell him about his experience he would do so unasked rector have no doubt that hino would come back from the village burst with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto liberally embellish with his active imagnation when the telephone ring on the day after hino go down to the village rector have a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return for there be few telephone in the village and the phone in rector s office rarely ring unless it be important he be surprise to find kayabashi s secretary on the other end of the line he be even more startle when he hear what kayabashi want the oyabun be entertain a group of dignitary the secretary say businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi wish to show them the mission they have never see one before and have express a curiosity about it oh rector say i guess it will be all right when would the oyabun like to bring his guest up here this afternoon the secretary say at three o clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time all right rector say i will be expect them he be about to hang up the phone but a note of hesitancy in the secretary s voice leave the conversation open he have something more to say i beg to inquire if the back be now safe for traveler he say rector laugh despite himself unless the oyabun have be work on it he say then check himself and add you can tell kayabashi san that the back road be in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use arigato gosaimasu the secretary sigh with relief and then the telephone click in rector s hand rector have no idea why kayabashi want to visit the mission for the oyabun to make such a trip be either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all the available information it be probably the latter kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily misinterpret by the people in the village at the same time it be unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity no kayabashi be bring his associate here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrive when he have give the call a few moment think he go into the kitchen to ask mr yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitor use the formal english china and the silver tea service which have be donate to the mission then he go outside to inspect the ground fujimoto have a pile of cutting near one side of the lawn rector ask him to move it for the time be he want the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless a good initial impression would be important now he go into the print shop where fletcher have just finish clean the press how many pamphlet do we have in stock rector say i should say about a hundred thousand fletcher say why i would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon rector say he explain about the visit and the effect he wish to create the picture of a very busy mission he do not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display the mission activity in a graphic and impressive manner fletcher nod a he listen to the instruction and say he would arrange the thing rector request rector s next stop be at the schoolroom where mavis be monitor a test he beckon to her from the door and she slip quietly outside he tell her of the visitor and then of his plan how many child do you have present today he say she look back toward the schoolroom fifteen she say no only fourteen the little ito girl have have to go home she have a pretty bad cold i would like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exuberant full of life i want to create the impression of a compound full of child do you think you can manage it mavis smile i ll try a rector be walk back toward the residential hall johnson come out of the basement and bound up to him the altercation in the coffee house have do little to dampen his spirit but he be still a little wary around rector for they have not yet discuss the incident i think i ve fix the pump so we win t have to worry about it for a long time he say i ve adjust the gauge so that the pump cut out before the water get too low fine rector say he look out over the expanse of the compound it be go to take a lot of activity to fill it have you ever operate a transit he say no sir johnson say you be about to become a first class surveyor rector say when konishi get back with the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boy konishi can help you you ll find an old transit in the basement the glass be out of it but that win t matter it look pretty efficient and that s the important thing he go on to explain what he have in mind johnson nod he say he could do it rector be warming to his over all strategy by the time he get back to the residential hall it be rather a childish game all in all but everybody seem to be get into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he have enjoy plan anything quite so much he be not sure what effect it would have but that be really beside the point when you get right down to it he be not go to lose the mission by default and whatever reason kayabashi have for bring his little sight see group to the mission he be go to be in for a surprise he find elizabeth in the parlor and ask her to make sure everything be in order in the residential hall and then to take charge of the office while the party be here when everything have be do rector go back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o clock at two thirty he send fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpse the approach of kayabashi s party then rector attire in his best blue serge suit sit in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a tree smoking a cigarette and wait the air be cooler here and the lacy pattern of the tree throw a dapple shadow on the grass an effect which he find pleasant

open foolishly after it have happen there be no word speak no apparent signal give yet the men all move at the same instant they pile into the wait car motor roar the car speed off the station wagon and the old plymouth head east toward jarrodsville the ford and the pickup truck speed west toward sanford s run in second all four car be out of sight marty land stand alone on a red clay road a storm cloud gather ominously in the sky again from a great distance thunder growl and break the silence land look back toward the dilapidate house he think he saw a pale face at a window perhaps it be dora may perhaps she would be glad that they hadn t hurt him there be other farmhouse nearby across the road there be one no more than a hundred yard away there be another on this side a little far down there be many more between here and jarrodsville telephone pole line the road they rear tall and mock their wire stretch out into infinity not a single strand of wire reach into the silent house beside the red clay road there be nothing he could do but walk and jarrodsville be more than three mile away down an old dirt road that the rain have turn into a quagmire marty face east and start walk down the leave side of the road after he have proceed a few foot he pause and turn up the cuff of his trouser which be already damp and mud cake the viscous mud be ankle deep and in place great puddle spread across the road and reflect the murky light a he approach the first farmhouse thunder sound behind him again close now and loud like a steadily advance drum corp there be several people on the porch of the farmhouse there be a very old man and a young woman and a brood of child range from toddler to teen agers for just an instant he think of appeal to them for help perhaps they have a car or truck and would drive him into town then he realize the utter futility of the idea they be star at him in the same blank and menace way that the men outside the gate have star even the eye of the small child seem malicious on his side of the road there be two farm hand well back in a field lean against a plow they too star at him the drum of thunder be right behind him now a foolish think come into his head he remember a story he have read a a youth it be probably one of kipling s tale of the british army it concern an officer who have be disgrace and drum out the steady roll of the drum have sound behind him a he walk between the endless rank of the men he have command and each man about face and turn his back a the officer approach marty wish these poor farm people would turn their back the fence by the roadside end now the dirt highway be border on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch too broad to leap over unless you be an olympic star the day s rain have be add to the stagnant water he be trap on the road when he hear the sound of an approach car it be come toward him the car be now in sight marty s heart skip a beat when he recognize it it be the station wagon that have pass his cab on the road the station wagon that have be park at the burch farm acey squire s station wagon it have head back toward jarrodsville that have only be a ruse to lure him out on the desert road now acey and his friend be return to seek him out the station wagon come to a stop a couple of hundred foot in front of him beside a fence field then there be another sound a second car be come from the west from the direction of sanford s run it be the ford that have be outside burch s farm marty look helplessly in both direction it be a narrow road barely wide enough for two car to pass he could not leave the road because of the water fill drainage ditch when the two car be equidistant from him the station wagon start up again and the ford gather speed they bore down on him there be nothing he could do except jump into the ditch he jump and sink to his knee in muddy water a the two car roar by there be a high pitch eerie nerve shatter sound marty know how the union soldier must have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the rag gray rank charge at them scream the wild banshee howl they call the rebel yell for moment he stand in water shiver and gasp for breath he have turn his ankle slightly and it pain him the car with their load of howl men have disappear in the distance there have be two more car park at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck they would be come for him next bear down on him from both direction and then the station wagon and the ford would seek him out again he would be harass repeatedly and would escape death by inch time after time all the way to jarrodsville he still have three mile to go back east the more affluent juvenile delinquent who could afford hype up auto instead of switch blade a lethal weapon play this same game and call it chicken he could not go through the field that way be bar on both side of the road by a high barb wire fence he have to make for the section of road just ahead that be border by the rail fence the section by the farmhouse at least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenter roar by again the admassy place could not be far now he would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest there be even a bare chance that the phone have not be disconnect he do not dare climb back up to the road he be deep in water but at least they could not reach him there he splash on mud suck at his foot with each step until he reach the end of the drainage ditch and the begin of the fence that enclose the farm he climb back to the road and he felt utterly exhaust he stand panting for a moment and then he saw something that he have not see before and panic grip him again the fence his only refuge when the metal death come roar at him be make of rail all right but the rail be protect by a thick screen of barb wire that would rip his flesh if he press against it he lurch on down the road despairingly because there be no place else to go he lose all sense of dignity you could not stand on dignity when you be soak and muddy and your life be at stake probably people be watch him from the porch or from behind the window of this farmhouse too but he do not bother to look he break into a dogtrot breathe heavily stream with sweat he have to reach admassy s place it be his only sanctuary the fence on both side of the road bristle with the barb wire the fence stretch on endlessly and then he hear them and now he saw them the plymouth be come at him from the east the pickup truck from the west they have time it well this time they would reach him at almost exactly the same instant he stop stone still if he back against the fence one of the car would brush him a it pass and he would be cruelly lacerate by the wire he stumble to the middle of the road and simply stand there wait for them a perfect target the car must have have their gas pedal push down to the floor board they be come on at reckless speed for such old vehicle they thunder at him he hold his arm close to his side and make himself a small a possible when the plymouth near it veer toward him and seem about to run him down he force himself to stay freeze there if he move he would be in the path of the other car he think the fender of the plymouth brush his jacket a it go by in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtle by on the other side the weird insane sound of the rebel yell reverberate again and echo from the distant hill he do not leave the middle of the road he do not try to run he trudge on his ache eye focus straight ahead he be near the admassy house he be go to make it he tell himself and then he hear a car come from the east and he felt a if he would break down and weep oh no not again he say aloud not again so soon there be a new sound a sound a pierce a the rebel yell yet different it be the sound of a siren now he saw that the approach car be paint white and he begin to wave his arm frantically it be the prowl car from the sheriff s office the car draw up alongside him and stop get in charley estes say brusquely he stagger into the back seat and lay back fight for breath there be someone in

the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set if i could call in they could check the story while we be on our way i wouldn t have to tell them i have robert then he hear it like a muffle thud felt a subtle change in air pressure he glance up in time to see robert hurtle down on him from above literally fly through the air his bloody face twist mickey try to flatten against the banister grip it with one hand but robert full weight strike him at that moment in the groin he gasp for air and the impact tear his hand from the rail he tumble with robert helpless and in agony over and over down the step by a wrench effort he manage to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and shoulder rather than his head he be fuzzy in his mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he be conscious and free of the weight of robert body when his vision clear he saw the tall one scramble upward reach mickey be on his knee when robert turn on the stair and the razor flash in his hand he felt his empty pocket and know that robert have retrieve the only weapon at hand mickey s eye fix on the other s foot which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack he rise stiffly force his knee to lock the knifelike pain in his groin nearly bring him down again he make himself back off slowly his eye wary on robert who now have no more to lose than he the pain dull a he move and he steady inside after a moment he extend one hand the finger curl come on he say you want to be that big a fool i be hop for this robert brush at his eye with his free hand and start down the step he hold the razor well out to one side he be invulnerable to attack but he could be handle mickey know if he could be bring to make the first move they be eight foot apart when robert clear the last step mickey wait with slack arm any time robert he say or would it be easy if i put my hand in my pocket the taunt be lose on robert he advance slowly directly give no hint of a feint to either side he be just short of arm s reach when he stop mickey back off two step force him to come on again there be a fix grin on robert face make hideous by the swell nose and the smear blood mickey back off again and robert hesitate then come along they move in a series of rhythmic fit and start a macabre dance two step back two step forward two step back mickey felt his shoulder come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door this be go to be it now any second and what he have to remember be to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if robert should feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand be his exclusive concern the kick come sudden and vicious but short mickey s gut twist with the effort but he keep his eye on the weapon it move in a silver arc toward his throat then veer downward he hunch his leave shoulder into it and slash at robert forearm with his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve before robert could move inside to cut upward toward his face he slam his right fist into robert belly robert sag and slash at him wildly duck mickey trip and fell to one side land heavily on the wood floor then robert be on him gasp for breath and for a couple of second mickey lose sight of the blade he felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his leave rib he get a knee up into robert belly use both hand and heave him clear then scramble to his foot they be in the center of the lobby now still clutch the razor robert come up into a crouch shake his head when he charge mickey be ready he hit robert with his leave fist in the rib and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobble in mid air with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind it he smash at the bloodstained face robert careen backward his back arch fight for balance and fail stumble against the newel post at the foot of the stair the sound of his head strike the solid wood be an ultimate sudden end sound he fell on his side across the low step roll over once then lay still mickey find himself lean against the desk with stiff hand panting for breath after a minute he go to robert look at one of his eye and felt for a pulse he couldn t feel any robert appear to be dead if not yet then soon very soon suddenly it be cold in the lobby it seem to him that a long time have pass before he decide what to do actually it be no more than eight or ten minute and the sum of his reason come to this there s no way to take him in now and keep those other two wister and the one who hire the two of them from find out about robert and lam out the local law here would hold me till they check clear back home and maybe more than that they would have to by then they could never catch up with the others there s no other way i ll have to do it myself he look at where robert lay sprawl on the step mickey be sure now he be dead one thing he think nobody know about it yet only me he climb the stair go into robert room find a suitcase and pack a much into it a he could he leave a few thing it didn t have to be perfect robert be a wastrel walk away on impulse he might logically leave behind what it be inconvenient to carry when he have close the suitcase he find a rag and move about the room wipe carefully everything he might have touch it take him nearly an hour he go to the room he have rent and get into his overcoat he leave the rest of his thing and return to the lobby he set robert suitcase near the front door go outside and walk back to the garage he be mildly surprise to find it be snow it snow softly silently an undulate interruption of his vision against the night sky he could feel it on his face and in his hair he find the key to the jeep get it start and warm it up for five minute then he back out and swing around to the front drive he go into the hotel and search till he find the razor he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping he take the suitcase out to the jeep and put it in the front seat then he go back for robert the body be heavy than he have anticipate he get it onto his shoulder after some work and carry it outside and down to the jeep he dump it into the back and make sure it wouldn t roll out then return to the porch and close the front door make sure it be unlock he drive carefully in the direction of the brief tour they have take early it snow continuously but quietly evenly when he reach the dip in the wood he saw that already the early rut be barely discernible the jeep fight it way through the low spot and get onto high grind he drive in low gear to the fork in the road and swing a close a possible to the entrance to the abandon mine he park face it and leave the headlight on but when he start into the tunnel with the suitcase he find the illumination extend no far than half a dozen foot into the passage he go back and get the flashlight return to the tunnel and carry the suitcase to the edge of the pit he have find early he toss the bag into the pit and watch dry dust spray up around it when the dust settle he go back to the jeep and carefully work robert body onto his shoulder it wasn t like carry the suitcase the soft snow be deceitful underfoot twice he nearly fell inside the passage he have to work his way over the fall timber and nearly collapse under his clumsy burden by the time he reach the edge of the pit he be panting and his shoulder and back ache under the drag of the dead weight he stand look down for a few second then back up two or three pace from the edge there be too much weight casually to toss it away he could feel himself fall in with it and be unable to get out it would be a bad place to die it be a bad place for robert to wind up but robert have ask for it it be too late to worry about that he kneel slowly and dump the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel it be a relief to get rid of the weight he be shake with tension and it take him a couple of minute to get his breath and settle down then he get on his knee and roll robert body toward the edge it hang momentarily on the point of drop off he give it a strong push hear it slide then tumble dryly into the hole he get to his foot and throw the flashlight beam into the pit the body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen foot below the level of the tunnel floor deep enough he decide there be little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter the external sign of his approach to it would be cover by the snow probably by the next day it wasn t cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact by spring it would be a skeleton he make his way back to the jeep he have start to back into the turn when he remember the razor in his pocket he climb down go back into the tunnel and toss the razor into the pit it land on robert sprawl right thigh poise precariously then slide off to the grind he go back once more to the jeep and start the short drive to the hotel in the garage he check the jeep for sign of the use he have make of it there be stain here and there and he clean them off use an oil rag he find on a nail he wipe the steering wheel and all the place he might have touch the jeep he replace the flashlight where it have be stow get into his own car and back it out of the garage there be tire mark where it have be but they be overlap by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny liz peabody he think might spend some time grieve for her lose lover but he doubt that she would launch an investigation he judge her to be a woman of some pride though not much sense still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently have run away

high office seat in front of the desk hank say i m look for some information with very little to go on sheriff he explain the background of the case ending with the tenuous clue which have bring him to gulf spring the sheriff s swivel chair tilt back so you re look for a woman who marry a man who might have live here a year ago and might have be poison if there be such a person i m afraid she get

cl09,cl09,imaginative,mystery,2393,maude s long nose unexpectedly wrinkle up happen to be in the hall happen to hear you quarrel about her oh well you can t really blame lolotte she lose her beau to you but she be talk of emile when she saw the black line of the open door sarah remember it clearly maude go on i ve get to get busy miss celie s take to her bed with the door lock she open it an inch and poke out the key for me to give you here she thrust a bundle of key string on a thick red cord into sarah s hand not that there s much use in lock up the smokehouse and the storehouse now drink your coffee coffee it s cold maude suddenly look quite capable of pour it down her throat i don t want it sarah say firmly oh well i ll take it down with me a i go maude swoop up the cup and hike up her top hoop a if about to take off with a race start at the door she turn back her roman nose look very long now and satiric i forget ben and lucien have go after them it s just like that book your northern friend write except there aren t any ice floe to cross and no bloodhound i don t know mr stowe what can they do if they find them they can t do anything it s silly childish run after them like that i tell ben so but of course the paterollers win t be of any help not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say be run around god know where she have swish away she have be go for a long time probably when sarah suddenly realize that she ought to stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it but then the so call coffee be bad enough at best cold it be all but undrinkable especially that cup she be deeply horribly sure that lucien have fill it with opium she have quarrel with lucien she have resist his demand for money and if she die by the provision of her marriage contract lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboard in the office but late when the war be over her father s entire estate she felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time now wait a minute she tell herself think about it lucien be not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee she have lose a bottle of opium but that be on the trip from new orleans or someone have take it during her first day at honotassa yes she have miss it after her talk with emile after dinner just before emile be shoot rilly or glendora have enter her room while she sleep bring back her wash clothe so somebody else could have come in too then or late while she be out of the room it would have be easy to identify a opium by it odor it be not very reasonable to believe that lucien have procure unprocurable opium and come back to honotassa with a form plan to murder her he didn t even know that she be there and he certainly couldn t have guess that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she be not the yield yes and credible fool he have every right to expect no he have be surprise unpleasantly surprise but surprise then somebody else don t question rev have say don t invite danger her skin crawl lolotte have tell maude that she be in the hall and the door be open sarah have begin to tell lucien of emile she have begin to question and a little draft have creep across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall so lolotte or anybody could have listen and that somebody could have already be supply with the miss bottle of opium that be not reasonable either the opium have disappear before emile s death and whoever shoot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foresee sarah s own doubt and suspicion and question she begin to doubt whether there have be in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup so suppose somebody only wish to frighten her so she would leave honotassa that make a certain amount of logic add to the argument be the fact that while she might have taste the coffee if it have be still hot she might even have drink some of it she wouldn t have take enough to kill her for she would have be warn by it taste no it be merely an attempt to frighten her she wouldn t go back to new york a maude suggest she wouldn t run like a scar cat but well she d be very careful she dress and the accustom routine restore to her a sense of normal everyday life but before she leave her room she dig into her big moire bag take out the envelope hold her marriage contract and the wax seal have be break so somebody else know what would happen to her father s money if she die rev have know all along rev didn t need to break the wax seal read the contract and find out he could conceivably have wish to make sure rev love honotassa it be like a part of his breath and body rev have stress the need for money rev would never have try to give her poison she thrust the envelope back in the bag there be no point in lock it up in the armoire now it be like lock the barn after the horse be steal and in all likelihood by now there be more than one person in the house who know the term of her marriage contract there be no point either in tell herself again what a fool she d be she go downstairs and receive another curious shock for when glendora flap into the din room in her homemade moccasin sarah ask her when she have bring coffee to her room and glendora say she hadn t too much work this morning miss sarah everybody go like that sarah swallow past another kind of constriction in her throat well then who bring it miss maude she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice not much breakfast this morning i don t know what we re go to do miss sarah we ve get to eat sarah say curtly because a chill crawl over her again maude glendora flap away the rice wasn t dose with opium indeed it have no taste at all not a grain of salt she eat what she could and go out along the cover passageway with the rain dripping from the vine in the kitchen glendora be despairingly pick chicken get a basket sarah tell her we ll go to the storehouse glendora drop a chicken and a flurry of feather and go with her through the drizzle to the storehouse sarah find the right key and unlock the door it be a long low room like a root cellar for it be bank up with soil and vine have run rampant over that too it be dark but dry and cool she doled out what glendora vaguely guess be the right amount of dry pea egg cornmeal a little salt the shelf look empty than when miss celie have show her the storeroom and since the men from the commissary have call there be certainly now few mouth to fee but there be less to fee them with she take glendora to the smokehouse unlock it and saw with satisfaction there be still a quantity of ham and side of bacon hang from the smoke stain rafter they wouldn t go hungry not yet and the field be green and grow can t you possibly imagine what life be go to be like here maude have say maude she send glendora back to the house her basket and her apron lade she stand for a moment rain dripping from the tree over her head think of maude maude have the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from sarah s room maude have the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she make up her mind to do she couldn t see how her death could affect maude she couldn t see any reason why maude would attempt to frighten her besides there be something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her maude be neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubt if she have ever be childish yet maude have suggest that sarah return to new york maude could have shoot emile if she d have a reason to kill him there be no use in stand there in the drizzle try to find a link between emile s murder and opium in a cup of coffee she start back for the house saw a light in the office open the door and surprise a domestic little scene which be far outside the dark realm of murder or attempt murder rev george and lolotte be mending shoe a light lamp stand on the table that dusky drizzle day they be all three bend over a shabby rid boot george have a tack hammer lolotte hold a patch of leather rev steady something a tiny brad wait for george s poise hammer george say first thing i do when i get to vicksburg again be get me a yankee with boot on lolotte laugh softly rev look up and saw her lolotte look up and stiffen george didn t look up at all there be no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them be surprise at sarah s appearance believe her to be drug and senseless and just possibly dead rev say come in sarah reckon you know the news and what news sarah think a satirically a maude might have say it rev s face be suddenly a little fix and question he turn to george and lolotte take your cobbler s shop somewhere else i want to talk to sarah everything in the office the spread circle of lamplight the patch of leather in lolotte s hand george poise with the tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all deny an attempt at murder a rush of panic catch sarah no not now i mean i ve get to to see to the kitchen glendora her word jumble together and she all but run from the office and from the question in rev s face now why do i do that she think a warm drizzle rain touch her face she be no schoolgirl refuse to bear tale a she reach the kitchen door the answer present itself if she tell anyone of the opium it must be lucien her husband it might be indeed it have already prove to be a marriage without love but it be marriage so she couldn t choose rev a a confidant it must be lucien always provide that lucien himself have not dose her coffee with opium she think a coldly and sharply again a maude might have say it she pause at the kitchen door catch her breath tell herself firmly that the opium be only an attempt to frighten her and go into the kitchen where glendora be eye the chicken dismally and maude be clean lamp chimney glendora give a gulp miss sarah i can t cut up no chicken miss maude say she win t again the homely everyday detail of daily live refute a vicious attempt to frighten her or to murder her the homely everyday detail of live and domestic requirement also press upon her with their immediate urgency no matter what have happen or hadn t happen somebody have to see about dinner she eye the chicken with if she have know it something of glendora s dismal look and think with a certain fury of the time she have spend on latin verb

in front of her be jump and wave around so badly it be all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter she wonder whether stanley would call she want to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she know he need she have skip her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she be out he hadn t and now she be feel sick both from concern about

still have your paper hat and you re wear it but then it be an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else you may be you be also the sculptor who create that most peculiar dame out in the back yard it s not too much to assume that you will have a more last interest in paper hat than will mr average citizen you have your paper horn clutch in your big craggy fist and for your entrance you have plan a noisy colorful and exuberant greet to your friend and tenant you find your house a focus of public and police attention can you imagine yourself forget under the circumstance that you be approach this startle and unexpected situation so unsuitably hat and armed with a paper horn maybe one could be startle into forgetfulness you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door you identify yourself and ask him what s go on instead of answer you he stick his head in the door and shout up the stair get the upstairs guy he bellow the owner do i send him up then he turn back to you go on in he say they ll tell you what s cook even then a you go into the house oppress by the knowledge that something be cook and that your house have pass under this unaccountable official control could you go on forget that you still have that ridiculous hat on your head and you be still carry that childish horn in your hand what i m get at be that we be fully prepare for felix s be an odd one we d see his handiwork out in the back yard and the little his tenant have tell u of him do make him sound a little special we be not however prepare for anything like the apparition that confront u a felix come up the stair he of course must have be equally unprepared for what confront him but nonetheless i do find his reaction startle if felix be still wear the hat and carry the horn because he d forget about them he now remember he come bound up the stair and join the dance he adjust the hat lift the horn to his lip a though it be a flute and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him our man stop dead and glower at felix felix throw his head back and laugh a laugh that shake the timber of even that solidly build old house this be a bull of a man he be big chested big shoulder and heavy armed his face be ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laugh he show his teeth which be big and white and strong and unquestionably home grow i don t remember ever see teeth that be quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not denture his hair have recede most of the way to the back of his neck he have only a fringe of hair and he wear it crop short it be almost a white a his teeth for a man of his mass he be curiously short he wasn t a dwarf but he be a bit of a comic figure a man with so big and so staggeringly develop a torso and such long and powerful arm be expect to stand tall than five foot five for felix it be a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement the man be just this side of be a freak we wait till he have finish laugh and that give u a few moment for take stock of him he be dress in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor man s country weekend dark gray sport jacket light gray slack pink flannel shirt black silk necktie his eye be clear he be freshly shave and if there have be any alcohol in him we could never have miss detecting some scent of it on the massive gust of his laughter not even a whiff eventually he subside felix gibby say me he say merrily me the happy one that much latin we remember gibby say dryly you always live up to your name always like this always make happy i try felix say blithely the world be full of bloke who put their heart into make the tragic scene i ve never notice that it improve thing any bully for you gibby say what s the rest of your name no rest of it felix be all there be all there ever be the past i leave to historian felix intone demonstrate that he could be pompous a well a happy you live in the present in the present felix proclaim for the future be there any other time in which a man can live we gibby announce be not philosopher we be assistant district attorney this gentleman be a police officer he be a fingerprint specialist could your future your immediate future be make to include take u upstairs give u a bit of space in which our friend can work and make available to him your finger tip the happy one could never have look happy this be more than joy it be ecstasy those lovely whorl he chortle so intricate so beautiful come right along i love fingerprint he be prance along the hall head for the next flight of stair gibby call him back we re here because of what happen last night he say past yes but important since it be important for the record let s have the full name that important felix ask that important grubb felix whisper felix grubb gibby ask not bother to whisper shh felix implore i can t see what would make it necessary for you to know nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world obligingly gibby lower his voice felix grubb he repeat no edmund but not for year for year it s be just felix first thing i do after my twenty first birthday be go into court and have it officially change and this be something i don t tell everybody that be almost forty year ago have volunteer that he be a man of about sixty he bound up the stair and with each leap render the number less credible this be a broth of a boy our felix and nothing be more obvious than the joy he take in demonstrate how agile he be and how full of juice and spirit we follow him up the stair the cop would gather up connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring u those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting you may think we didn t need nancy and jean but you always get what you can when you can and we have no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn t be useful before we be through with this case also if we have exclude the lady we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stand the killer if in our present group would certainly be interest in know that much and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it be i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation there might always be some way if you can possibly avoid it you don t hand out any extra chance felix take u into his studio it be that oddly shape space at the very top of the house where ceiling height have to accommodate themselves to the vary angle of roof slope at each angle of it pitch a big skylight have be fit into the roof and all these skylight be fit with system of multiple screen and shade when felix first open the door on it all these shade be tightly draw and the whole studio be a dark a night he quickly fix that roll back the shade on some of the skylight and adjust screen on the others he fly about the place make these adjustment and it be obvious that what he be do be the fruit of long experience none of his movement be tentative there be no process of trial and error start with the room completely black out a it be when we come in he unerringly fix thing so that the whole place be bath in the maximum of light without at any point admit even so much a a crack of glare expect something more than average wacky i be surprise by what we find there be no display of either work in progress or of finish work here and there on work table or pedestal stand a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin drape over it these shape might have be mad but there be no tell they be all completely shroud the equipment be solid and heavy and in good condition everything be orderly and it seem to be arrange for the workman s comfort convenience and efficiency there be tool about but they be neatly keep there be no confusion and no litter supply of sheet metal be neatly stack in bin

manage the former or expect the latter they have nothing to give to each other the omission might look peculiar to outsider but andy could not bring himself to go through the motion simply for the sake of appearance he have little time to himself anyway a the afternoon speed toward evening the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aide pass in and out each with his own special problem thornburg arrive with the writer they have spend the morning revise the act eliminate all the gay song patter and dance with a view of the best public relation what remain lack the original verve but it be at least dignify a befit the tragic circumstance raymond fox report that the orchestra have hastily rehearse cradle song in case it be need charlie marble be back and forth on several occasion first to confer with andy on the advisability of cancel the la vega engagement they decide it be wise and late to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client have agree to fill the casino s open date and once bake slip in pale and draw last night s liquor still on his breath with some of today s add to it he ask if there be anything he could do andy invent a job to keep him busy send

dorado be surround by a mob they overflow the parking lot make progress by automobile difficult long before he reach the protection of the stage door andy be recognize word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire they surge around him finger point eye pry it be not a hostile gather but andy sense the difference from last night s hero worshipper they have come not to admire but to observe it s bad inside thornburg inform andy skolman s jam in every table he could find under the head of it s an ill wind et cetera backstage be tomblike by contrast andy s co worker keep their distance awe by the tragedy but in his dress room be a large bouquet and a card that read we re with you all the way it be sign by everyone in the troupe andy couldn t help but be touch he instruct shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be post on the call board bake be wait to report that lou duvol have be sober up to the point where he could function efficiently andy gather that this have be no small accomplishment bake himself look well any kind of job be well than brood andy tell him bake i wish you d talk to skolman see if some kind of p a system can be rig up outside it s just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn t able to get a table i wouldn t want him to miss the message i ll try skolman isn t go to like it much though give away what he should be

you to have the speaker take out andy sigh seem like we re never go to see eye to eye lieutenant didn t they tell you what i want the p a system for sure i know but it s such a long shoot no long than yours what do you expect to get tonight anyway you think somebody be go to stand up in the audience and make guilty face or have a sign on his car that say here come the paxton kidnapper andy crumble the script in his fist i can t stop you from do what you think be right but don t try to stop me either someday bonner say you re go to ask u for help i can hardly wait what you don t understand be that i m ask for it now but bonner depart still full of ill will he have get stick with a job too big for his imagination he have to cling to routine test procedure to act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness but admit or not bonner be helpless the crime show too much plan the kidnapper appear too proficient to be catch by a checklist andy s performance be schedule for eleven o clock he stall for a half hour long hop to hear something from vecchio about the ransom money bake and shirl winter on separate telephone could not reach him at any conceivable location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear cut information regard his effort bake curse the sweaty bastard s probably halfway to peru with our money by now when no one smile he felt constrain to add just kid natch thornburg pop in to advise andy skolman s send up smoke signal you about ready what s he complain about bake ask they re drink aren t they no we get a bunch of sipper out there tonight i guess nobody want to pass out and miss anything thornburg add in a lower voice but andy overhear they act more like a jury than an audience andy say well i guess we can t wait any long hub you stick by the stage door if rock show up during the number or you hear anything give me the signal shirl winter say i ll stay on the phone mr paxton there s a couple of call back i can work on you re a sweetheart but

be right the act cut to shred and hastily patch together during the afternoon have not be rehearse sufficiently by anyone the result have nothing of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night here s where luck would normally step in but this be no ordinary show and andy know it whether he sing well or badly have nothing to do with it the audience have come not to be entertain but to judge twenty four hour have change him from a performer to a freak within this framework what follow be strain even macabre eliminate the patter and the upbeat number leave little but blue and other song of equal melancholy the effect be a depress a a gravestone the applause irresolute and short live yet andy plow ahead mouth the inconsequential word a if they possess real mean and gradually his listener warm to him their clap grow more fervent the evening be still not beyond salvage not a a show but for him a a person the worst be yet to come a andy reach the finale of his act a subdue commotion backstage draw his attention to the wing rocco vecchio a perspire haggard vecchio be stand there flank by two men in the uniform of armored transport guard vecchio be nod and point at the large suitcase he hold andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief he wave at fox to cut off the finale introduction the music die away discordantly he draw a deep breath lady and gentleman in place of my regular close number tonight i d like to sing something of a different nature for you ray if you please the cradle song he sense rather than hear the gasp that sweep across the audience nor could he blame them this particular song at this particular time could only be interpret a the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bound of decency have no choice he plunge into it anyway hold onto the microphone for support lullaby and goodnight his voice shake for the first time in his life he forget the lyric midway through and have to cover up by hum the rest he wonder if the audience would let him finish they do though contemptuous they be still polite but when he be finally through their scorn be make apparent someone clap tentatively then quickly stop otherwise the silence be complete a the light come up andy could see that a number of patron be already on their way toward the exit he stumble off stage my god he mutter my god hub be there to support him it s okay mr paxton the money s here all of it at this moment all he could think of be what he d be force to undergo do you hear them do you know what they think of me bunch of damn jerk hub growl who need them thornburg pat his arm sure andy it ll be all right nothing break that can t be mend the word be hollow thornburg know well than any of them that a public image be a fragile a humpty dumpty all the king s horse and all the king s men vecchio shoulder in i get it andy god know how but i get it you ll never believe the place i ve be today i practically have to sign your life away you ll probably fire me for some of the deal i have to go for but andy nod dully it doesn t matter rock we ve do our part he clutch that knowledge to him a he return to his dress room the usual congratulatory crowd be conspicuously absent the place have the air of a morgue andy have no desire to linger himself but hub report that the mob outside be still large despite the effort of the

city and then rise toward home he have to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minute suck in air and squint and blink his eye to clear them of tear what on earth be in mae s mind that she want him up there spy on what the cop be do what do she think he could do he try to ignore what his own common sense tell him but it wasn t possible her motif be too blatant she want him to get into trouble she want the police to notice him suspect him she be go to keep on scheme poke prod suggest and dictate until the cop get up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask question and he know in that moment with a cold sink of despair a die of old hop that mae have spread some kind of word there among the neighbor nothing bald open but enough they d have some suspicion to repeat to the police though his inner thought cringe at it he force himself to think back recreate the scene in which mae claim to have catch him molest the child it hadn t amount to anything there

the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness a mae have click on the light suppose the cop somehow get hold of that well it hadn t be what it seem he d have no idea the girl be in there he hadn t touch her and when he come to examine the scene there be a certain staginess to it it have the smell of plan and a swift suspicion dart into his mind too monstrous of course mae wouldn t have plot a thing like that it be just that little accident play into her hand like this murder he lean on the wheel clutch it star into the sunlight and try to bring order into his thought he felt light head and sick there be no use wander off into a territory of utter nightmare mae be his wife she be marry to him for well or for bad she wouldn t be wilfully plan his destruction but she be she be

curb at the right just stand there morosely he didn t even look up behind him on the step of the little office sit old man arthur he be straight something angry in his attitude a if he might be wait to report something holden step on the gas a new idea drift in from nowhere he could go to the police he could tell them his fear of be involve he could explain what have happen in the old neighborhood and how mae have misunderstand and how she have hold it over him the scene be complete in his mind at the moment even to his own jerk and snivel and ferguson s silent patience he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department it wasn t what mae would want him to do though he be sure of this once he have abandon himself to the very worst once he have quiet all the dragon of worry and suspense there wouldn t be very much for mae to do at that moment holden almost slam on the brake to go back to cooper and ask if ferguson be about it would be such a relief what be that old sign suppose to be paint over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here why holden say to himself surprise at his own sudden insight i ll bet some of those people who enter be just a happy a can be they ve worry they ve lie awake night they ve shake at the slight footstep they ve picture their own destruction and now it s all over and they can give up sure they re give up hope hand in hand with hope go thing like terror and apprehension good bye holden wave a hand at the empty street glad to see you go he drive into the pave space before the garage and get out slam the car

cl14,cl14,imaginative,mystery,2485,a man with a sketch pad in hand sit with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long dim corridor and make pencil line on paper and say be this more like it mr macready or be the eyebrow more like this when he have finish with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same thing to someone else most probably a busboy begin to look like him now would you say different about the mouth huh more like this maybe men blow dust on object in a room on the seventeenth floor of the hotel dumont and blow it off again and do the same in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forty and men also use vacuum cleaner in both room suck dust up once more men from the third detective district eighteenth precinct have the long the most tedious job at the hotel dumont there have at the time in issue be twenty three overnighter count couple a singular these include a one mr and mr anthony payne who have check in a little after noon the day before and have not check out together but gardner will be not include he have be at the dumont for almost a week there be of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they seek have stay only overnight at the hotel the twenty three or twenty two with the paynes themselves omit provide merely a place to start and their identification be the bare of start with name and address list verification come next it would take time it would almost inevitably trouble some water i certainly be not at the dumont last night and my husband couldn t have be he s in boston of course he s in the hotel king arthur across the street provide almost twice a many problem the king arthur offer respectable and convenient lodging to people from the suburb who want to see a show and didn t want heaven know didn t want to lunge anxiously through crowd street to railroad station and at odd hour of night drive from small station to distant home probably through rain or in november something bad the king arthur be less expensive than the dumont the king arthur have fifty four overnighter again count room rather than people check the overnighter out fail to find what be want a be most likely check out other guest with special but not exclusive attention to those with room on the street anyone active enough can reach a roof wherever his room may be and know while all this go on that there be no real reason to suppose that the murderer have be a guest in either hotel it be not even certain the shoot have be fire from either hotel there be other roof less convenient but not impossible it be dull business detecting and hard on foot there be also the one salient question to ask and ask widely do you notice anything out of the way like for example a man carry a twenty two rifle probably with a telescopic sight attach there be of course no hope it really would be that simple the sniper whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent would hardly have walk to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder whistle a march tune anybody carry anything that might hide a rifle long thin suitcase or long fat suitcase for that matter shrug meet that from room clerk from bellhop who measure but nothing it appear long enough to attract attention case say for musical instrument none note at the dumont several at the king arthur a combo be stay there and have be for a week anything else anything at all shrug meet that detective pearson eighteenth precinct think for a time he might be on to something a refuse bin at the dumont turn up a florist s box a very long box for very long stem flower trace of oil on green tissue the lab to check the lab sorry no oil anything at all strange well a man have try at the king arthur to register with an ocelot at the dumont a guest have come in a collapsible wheel chair at the king arthur one guest have have his head heavily bandage and another have a bandage foot and have walk with crutch there have also be a man who must have have st vitus or something because he keep jerk his head a report dribble in william weigand toss them into the centrifuge which have become his head mullins come in there be no sign of mr lauren payne at her house on nod road ridgefield connecticut the house be modern large on five acre must have cost plenty the state cop would check from time to time pass word when there be word to pass weigand toss this news into the centrifuge sort thing out damn it sort out the next move try to forget motive for the moment consider opportunity only those actually with payne when he be shoot or who have leave the party within not more than five minute make five arbitrary positively have none the north hathaway jerry s publicity director livingston birdwood producer of uprise they have be with payne when he be shoot could not therefore have shoot him from above take gardner will he have leave after the scuffle have be see to leave he would have have ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey consider him seriously therefore intangible enter then hunch which felt like fact will would ambush certainly will undoubtedly have will be presumably a well than average shoot but hunch now will would not ambush anything which go on two leg instead of four because if for no other reason will would never for a moment suppose he be not big tough than anything else that go on two leg ambush be lay by those who doubt themselves a any man may against a tiger faith constable have have to go on from the party and have presumably go on to be check out far forget motive no motive be a part of fact nobody in his right mind punish a quarter century old dereliction grudge simply do not keep that well in a sane mind faith constable have accomplish much in a quarter of a century jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong bill shake his head also he think i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun lauren herself she have leave the party early plead a headache no lack of opportunity presume she have a gun she might conceivably have bring one in in a large enough suitcase check on the payne luggage she might now have take it away again motive her husband wander bitter unreasoning jealousy heaven know it happen and hell know it too but it happen almost always among the primitive and usually among the very young call it mentally young call it retard there be nothing to indicate that lauren payne be primitive she do not move in primitive circle she be young but not that young it occur to bill weigand that he be on a hunch basis eliminate a good many he remind himself that all elimination be tentative he also remind himself that he have an unusual number of possibility the mason mother or son or mother and son opportunity be obvious motive here too the cause to hate lay well back in the year but bitterness have more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode with the boy particularly the boy have apparently if mr macready be right in what she have tell mullins only in recent month be force to give up college to work a a busboy see the man he blame for this make much of youth and bitterness and bill pick up the telephone get mullins send out a pickup on mr mason and the boy when you ve get enough to go on bill say right mullins would do a man name lars simon playwright director have express a wish that anthony payne drop dead he would say of course that he have not really have any such wish that what he have say be no more than one of those thing one do say lightly mean nothing which probably would turn out to be true which he obviously have to be give the opportunity to say a man name blaine smythe with y and e but pronounce without them have be fire at payne s insistence he be also if pam north be right a close acquaintance of lauren payne s than she now be incline to admit he might deny the latter would certainly deny any connection between the two thing or any connection of either with murder he would have to be give the opportunity mullins it be evident that mullins be the man to go it be evident that a captain should remain at his desk direct with a firm hand and keep a firm seat bill weigand be good and tire of the wall opposite and the crack in the plaster let mullins keep the firm seat let stein when siamese cat be intertwine it be difficult to tell where one leave off and

cl15,cl15,imaginative,mystery,2358,through a door conveniently unlock madden supplement that damn door say the police chief a gift horse to be view with suspicion madden s dark face wear a meditative look if there be collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door late and it make a very poor red herring for an inside job much well to break a cellar window don t forget there be the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling remind him well with a house a big a that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldn t be notice right away unless there be a police investigation yeah and a pane of glass isn t hard to the telephone interrupt him he scoop up the receiver and say police chief into the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson i be hop i d hear from you today with his free hand he pull a pad and pencil toward him and begin to make note a he listen say uh huh and i see at interval at last he say well thank you for call mr benson although there be no doubt in my mind and we ve be handle it a one i m glad to have it make official he hang up coroner he say to madden he s just hear from the pathologist who say mr meeker apparently die from suffocation pauling look at his note many minute hemorrhage in the lung particle of lint and thread in the mouth and nostril scrap from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread find in the nasal and oral cavity no other cause of death apparent trachea clear of mucus and foreign object brain examine for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage no sign of these no gross hemorrhage of lung heart brain or stomach he pause that s about it oh the time of death the duration of the digestive process vary the pathologist say but the empty stomach and the find in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that mr meeker die several hour after her seven o clock dinner probably around midnight give or take an hour either way pauling pause again so there it be he say not your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer be one and the same they discuss this possibility however likely it be pauling say he couldn t limit himself to it he have to look for other prospect other motif until more conclusive evidence point to johnston come to light madden with his investigation center on the fraud say that tomorrow he would go to the bronx bank through which mr meeker s check to johnston have clear arthur williams have to be locate they agree he might have be in collusion with johnston on the fraud he might be mr meeker s murderer or have play some part in her death this be madden s suggestion the police chief shake his head over it if arthur williams be involve in the fraud or the murder then he too have another identity no one the medfield police have question profess to know any more about him than about johnston scholarship applicant pauling look doubtful madden explain that he be think of an application send directly to mr meeker then he ask to use the phone and call brian thayer who say that he be just leave to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o clock madden say that he would see him at two and make another call this one to mr meeker s lawyer mr hohlbein be out for the day but mr garth would be free at one thirty the secretary s tone indicate that an appointment at such short notice be a concession for which madden should be duly grateful he infer that hohlbein and garth be high price lawyer he have lunch with pauling promptly at one thirty he enter hohlbein and garth s elegant suite of office in medfield s new professional build he dislike garth on sight conservative clothe and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirty handclasp too consciously quick and firm youngish man on the make madden label him and be ready to guess that in a correct not too push fashion the junior partner of the firm have political ambition that mr garth would be impeccably suitable a the wife of a rise young lawyer that there be three child two boy and a girl that she be active in the woman s club and he in lion rotary and jaycee and finally that neither of them have harbor an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day madden know that he could be completely wrong about all this but also know that he would go right on dislike garth garth be prepare to be helpful in what he refer to with fastidious distaste a this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he say more than once have ever come about if mr meeker have only see fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it madden regret not be able to find fault with so true a statement he ask to see a copy of mr meeker s will garth bring one out the date october immediately catch the inspector s eye fairly recent he remark be she in the habit of make new will oh no she have reason to change the one she make right after mr meeker s death her estate have grow considerably she want to make a more equitable distribution of it among the group that would benefit the most particularly the scholarship fund at the time the will be draw mr hohlbein mention to me how mentally alert she seem for her age know just what change she want make and so forth garth hesitate mr hohlbein and i have notice some lapse since though most of them this past year i d say even two or three year ago i doubt that she d have become involve in this unfortunate johnston affair she d have consult u you see she always do before and show the utmost confidence in whatever we advise the inspector nod doubt this mr meeker hadn t strike him a ready to seek anyone s advice least of all garth s with her sharp tongue she d have cut his pompousness to ribbon it would have be hohlbein who handle her affair madden settle back to read the will he skim over the million that go to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center the public health nurse association the library and so on pause when he come to the scholarship fund two million be add to what have be set aside for it in mr meeker s lifetime and the proviso make that a long a brian thayer continue to discharge his duty a administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustee hereinafter appoint by the bank administer the estate he be to be retain in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increase responsibility enlargement of the fund would entail a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflect tenure too very nice for him he go on to personal bequest a list of name largely unknown to him twenty five thousand to each of the great niece in oregon not much to blood relative out of million ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollar to the peck ten thousand each to joan sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be pay to her in the event that she be still in mr meeker s employ at the time of the latter s death no additional five thousand for each year after joan s twenty first birthday mr meeker hadn t get around to take care of that too bad madden think joan sheldon have earn the large bequest mr hohlbein be leave twenty thousand garth ten there be no other name madden recognize arthur williams s might well have be include he felt mr meeker have spend a small fortune on a search for him but have make no provision for him in her will if he should be find after her death and have never mention his name to her lawyer madden take up this point with garth who shrug it off old people have their idiosyncrasy this one come a bit high at thirty thousand or more well she have a number of them where money be concern garth say sometimes we d have trouble persuade her to make tax exempt charitable contribution and i ve know her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fix a faucet the next moment she d put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something a impractical a this unfortunate johnston affair there be no tell how she d react to spend money madden inquire next about the audit of the scholarship fund there be an annual audit garth inform him no discrepancy or shortage have ever be find brian thayer be a thoroughly honest and competent administrator his salary have reach the ten thousand mark his expense run another four or five thousand the lawyer didn t know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party thayer like himself madden reflect be the extra man so prize by hostess and find him easy enough to talk to but he didn t play golf didn t seem to belong to any local club his work take him away a lot of course which probably account for his tendency to keep to himself garth s glance begin to flicker to his watch he say that he have already tell the police chief that he didn t know what insurance man have recommend johnston to mr meeker he would offer no theory to account for her murder the whole thing his manner convey be so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demand be sweep under the rug no doubt mr meeker have snub him many a time and he felt no grief over her pass even so madden s dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepen it would be all right with him he decide if his investigation of the fraud with it probable by product of murder lead to garth s door motive ten thousand dollar bequest at first glance not much of a motive for a man of his stand but for all his air of affluence who could tell what his private financial picture be the inspector know a he leave that this be wishful think nevertheless he make a mental note to look into garth s financial background brian thayer have a downtown address he live in an apartment house not over three or four year old a reclaim island of landscape brick and glass on the fringe of the business district he occupy a two bedroom apartment on the fourth floor use the second bedroom a his office airy and bright the apartment be furnish with good modern furniture rug and drapery do by a professional decorator madden think and somehow a impersonal a unremarkable a it occupant in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month in medfield perhaps twenty five less not all of it pay by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account he take madden into the room he use a an office it contain a desk file a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchair a newspaper open at stock market report lay on one of them thayer fold it up and offer a drink the inspector decline to begin the interview he ask if thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he have say the other day about johnston thayer shake his head it s all i think about too that and her death it s still unbelievable that it be murder for all her domineer way i can t conceive of her have have a deadly enemy

about jerry burton at all until he enter his live room and close the door behind him only then when his glance focus on the divan and saw that it be empty do he remember his early problem even from where he stand he could see the neatly fold blanket that he have spread over burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it then he be stride across the room his thought confuse but the worry build swiftly inside him a he snatch up the note jack look in the wastebasket i know the only way i could beat you be to play possum but it be a good try kid and i appreciate it the wastebasket stand near the wall next to the divan and the instant casey pick it up he know what have happen the discard paper inside be sodden there be a glint of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky be strong and distinct he put the basket down distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgust with himself and his plan that have seem so foolproof for he remember too well how he have bring back the load drink to burton and then return to the kitchen to get weak drink for himself for another second or two he give in to the annoyance that be direct at himself then his mind move on to be confront by something far more serious and a the think expand the implication jar him it no long matter that burton have outsmart him the important thing be that burton have go somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket and that gun be empty even before his mind have round out the idea he thrust one hand into his trouser pocket and pull out the six slug he have take from the revolver he consider them with brood eye brow bunch a his brain grapple with the problem and try to find some solution he say the crazy fool half aloud he put the shell on the table a though he could no long bear to hold them he think where the hell could he have go how can i find him there be no answer to this and he begin to pace back and forth across the room his imagination out of control he try to tell himself that maybe burton have sober up enough to get some sense maybe he only intend to scare the blackmailer whoever he be in which case an unload gun would be good enough he think of other possibility none of them satisfactory and finally he begin to think to wonder if there be some way he could reach burton then a he turn toward the telephone it ring shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reach for it eagerly yeah he say casey yeah tony calenda casey hear the voice distinctly and he know who it be but it take him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head when he hear calenda say what about that picture you take this afternoon it still take him another few second to remember the job he have do for frank ackerly what picture he demand you take a picture of me at the corner of washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon who say so one of my boy casey believe that much calenda be not the sort who walk around without one of his boy close at hand so with my trial come up in federal court next week i wouldn t want that picture publish who say it s go to be publish i wouldn t even want it to get around under normal circumstance casey be a little fussy when people tell him what to do with picture he have take even so he generally listen and be usually reasonable to those who voice their objection properly right now however he be still too worry about jerry burton and the gun that have no bullet and the story burton have tell him to care too much about tony calenda his nerve be get a little rag and his impatience put an edge in his voice look he say i be hire to take a picture i take it that s all i know about it and that s all i care maybe you d well tell the guy who hire you what i say you tell him all right calenda say his voice still quiet but i mean what i say casey if that picture get around and i find out you have anything to do with it i m go to send a couple of my boy around to see you you do that casey say just be sure to send your two best boy tony he hang up with a bang annoy at himself for run off at the mouth like that but still terribly concern with the situation he have help to create a soon a he could think logically again he reach for the telephone directory and find jerry burton s home number he dial it and listen to it ring ten time before he hang up he call the bar and grill where he have pick burton up that afternoon when he be tell that no one have see burton since then he think of three other place that be possibility each time he get the same answer and in the end he give up by the time he have smoke three cigarette he have calm down he have do all he could and that be that and anyway burton be not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he be drink he casey have be scar for a while but that have come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible he should have stay here and watch burton he didn t so he make a mistake so what he keep tell himself this a he go out to the kitchen to make a drink only then do he decide he didn t want one he consider opening a can of beer but veto that idea too finally he go into the bedroom and sit down to take off his shoe he have just finish unlace the right one when the telephone ring again when he snatch it up the voice that come to him be quick and urgent casey you don t know me but i know you if you want a picture get to the corner of adam and clark just a fast a you can if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boy casey hear the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it take him no more than three second to make his decision for over the year he have receive many such call some of them come from people who identify themselves some telephone because he have do them a favor in the past others because they expect some sort of reward for the information a few pass along a tip for the simple reason that they like him and want to give him a break only an occasional tip turn out to be a phony and like the police casey have make a point of run down all such suggestion and he do not hesitate this time he be in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minute and it take him only three more to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue it be a district of small factory and loft build and occasional tenement and he could see the police radio car a he round the corner and slam on the brake he do not bother with his radio there would be time for that late but a he scramble out on the pavement he saw the fill station and the public telephone booth and know instantly how he have be summon the police car have pull up behind a small sedan it headlight still on

curiously nick wonder if elaine have buy them but he say nothing nobody he suddenly realize be say anything it seem a if they be all under a spell there should be an excite conversation for somewhere directly below them be a treasure lose for more than four hundred year but instead of chatter there be a null like on the radio direction finder once in new york he have go fly with some friend in a small private airplane with a single engine they have all be laugh joke when suddenly the engine have fail no one have scream no one have pray all have fall into a complete silence listen to the wind whistle over the wing the pilot have be good he d land the plane on a small airstrip in connecticut and a soon a the aircraft have coast to a stop everyone have burst into chatter at the same moment there have be tension in the plane during the silent descent a tension similar to the one now but in the plane there be a concrete reason for it now at this moment there should be none unless skin dive be much more dangerous than he have be lead to believe yet tension exist the same taut nerve relationship a there have be between the passenger on the plane now strain at the three of them here on the boat it hang over them like a cloud it arrival a sudden a a cloud skid over the sun silently elaine pick up her key from the table and go out into the cockpit poet behind her nick trail behind

for elaine a moment late move awkwardly because of the swim fin she pick up the gun hand the knife to poet then roll off the transom of the boat back first poet nod to nick and enter the water in a similar fashion another moment and they be out of sight leave behind only a string of bubble a a clue to their whereabouts for a while nick follow the twist course of the bubble wonder which set come from elaine they remain close together their air trail wiggle like serpent travel side by side eventually the bubble become lose in the sparkle of the ocean surface and he roll over on his back clasp his hand behind his head he star at the blue sky there be nothing quite like be alone on a boat on the ocean alfredo certainly must have enjoy be alone next to the ocean probably the loneliest spot be the desert if elaine s uncle have stick to this desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive yet alfredo want money want money to roam through the desert and graham want money probably to roam among the dice table in la vega it be an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the trinidad but graham hadn t stumble on it two to three week prior to the charter of the virginia graham have be snoop around the san luis rey mission the small helicopter with it two steel skid churn offshore and nick raise up to watch it head south that be a hell of a note he think a

spot where the ocean drop off to fantastic depth almost from the shoreline someday geologist have warn the land on both side of these deep would fall into the ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach meanwhile fisherman take advantage of them to pull up whopper sometimes the fish explode a they near the surface because of the difference in pressure why he wonder have elaine want him along on this trip he couldn t skindive he couldn t run a boat except on the open sea he stand up stretch look around for the bubble but could see none stroll down to the galley he light the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew be heat pour himself a cup and go up to the chartroom turn on the hi fi he go back to the cockpit stretch out on the cushion and listen to the music elaine and poet return together pop up over the transom almost like dolphin break water he sit up and watch a they pull themselves over the stern any luck he ask poet shake his head slide his face mask up on his forehead we re right on the edge of the deep elaine say pull off her face mask she carefully place the spear gun across the stern then lift her wet hair from her back and squeeze out the water which be a break a the area to search be less than a square mile she add a she swing her leg over the transom any news not a thing he toss her a towel then repeat the service for poet cigarette elaine shake her head a she slip out of her harness but poet nod his foot still hang over the stern of the transom but a he reach for the smoke he raise them to swing them in the fin on his foot catch on the moulding throw him off balance his forearm smash painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimace a he grab his bruise limb with his other hand and roll into the boat kee reist the word hiss distinctly from poet s lip a he struggle to his foot nick s body become rigid turn slowly he saw poet in a brilliant glare of horror poet his face be still crease in pain a he study the underside of his arm poet a murderer turn quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stand in shock surprise the sudden silence be too silent instinctively aware of the charge atmosphere poet raise his head slowly look first at elaine

of the frantic struggle poet the moment the sea close over nick some atavistic sense warn him that he would survive in this alien element only if he do not panic but the murderer to whom he cling have a tremendous advantage the wide flipper on poet s foot give his leg incredible power drive the two of them down into the water a they roll over and over poet be the capture arm pinion to his side and he twist convulsively try to escape poet would escape nick think grimly because he wear the apparatus which would keep him alive under water but nick would not let go the rubber and glass face mask slip from poet s forehead bounce painlessly off nick s chin then disappear poet twist again and nick s knuckle scrap on the air tank rip off the skin for a split second nick relax his grip and poet s slippery body spin completely around before nick could stop him hold him now from the rear something flail at the side of nick s head a they roll around and around suddenly poet stop struggle and the two of them hang suspend in the water not rise not sink a sharp pain lance across nick s chest and a bubble of air escape from his torture lung join dozen of others that sail lazily toward the surface like helium balloon rise into the sky a black snake like object sway eerily in front of him spew bubble from it flat cobra head the air hose be free the discovery strike nick like a blow desperately nick flash one hand up catch poet s neck in the bend of his elbow at the same instant he grab the loose writhe hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece instinctively he exhale through his nose then suck in the air from the hose at once the excruciate pain in his chest stop and he be seize with a sudden wild exultation a if this be a signal poet abruptly begin to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly make them sink through the water relentlessly nick hold on suck on the hose inhale the air that belong to poet poet be not fight nick now

who live on the back of cape ann they be not just like others there s a different hall mark on them there be no witch burn here because everyone have a witch in the family just think of old granther

he be never know to run or even walk fast today dogtown be the only desert village in all new england that i know of there it sit a small highland with town like gloucester near by but now it s the most lose and torture place in the world those who live in that desolation of rocky deformity take on some of the moraine s stony character scientist say it be the last spew of a great glacier but one rather feel that only a malevolent giant could have pile up those crouch monster of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspend ominous life in them we ll walk up there late it s perhaps a mile from here where we sit and not one single dwell leave there though once in the early eighteenth century there be close to a hundred house i myself have identify about sixty sit from the old map and register a fascinate pursuit i assure you even i can remember nothing but ruin cellar and tumble pillar and nobody have live there in the memory of any live man it be now a sweep of boulder and ledge with oak walnut and sumac creep across the common and everywhere the ruin and the long long shadow that s your set and a sinister one please get that in your report it account for so many thing both red mciver and handley walker live nearby almost a near a i do red live at lanesville and from his house he could be up on the common in a half hour s brisk walk handley live far on at pigeon cove i d often find one or other of them up around dogtown sketch they be both painter they be they be what should one say well anyhow dogtown common be so much off the beat track nowadays that only sunday picnicker still stray up there from time to time sea road railroad lack of water kill dogtown dead dead a a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for i m about the last to be even interest i know red and handley well a i say they be both painter they d come separately to gloucester some twenty year ago there s always be an artist colony somewhere on cape ann and each marry here they marry cousin anta and freya norberg there be a lot of scandinavian in this neck of the wood and many still make paint furniture and take steam bath pretty girl among them with blonde hair and pert face handley marry freya and red of the red beard marry anta and it be because of an old norberg inheritance that i get to understand them all so well the quarrel end in a ridiculous draw but i must tell you about it oh yes i m quite sure it s important because of the beech pasture what s that why that s what give me the feel give me a it be the spirit the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair you see besides be custodian of antiquity i be also registrar no i don t hold with those who live entirely among dead thing i know a well a the next man that a ship be call from the rig she carry where the live wind blow and not from the hull but you ve get to know both what s below the water line interest me also a i be say i ve know all about the old record include the old norberg deed some ten year ago that page be tear out i don t know by whom about five year ago handley come to ask me if he could see the tattered register he be courteous and casual about it a though it be of no consequence he s always like that in spite of be a big man when you see him you ll notice his habit of finger i might almost say stroke a large mole with black hair on it by his right temple a sensual man but very courteous some would say slick like his glossy black hair too many outside manner to my taste he be the sort who with an appraise eye would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her a real gentleman i feel would do neither he s always wear a broad brim hat and i ve notice in my small study at the society that he rather smell of cosmetic the next week cousin red wander in a casually but curt and untidy red be small and fine bone like ivory inlay he too ask to see the same page when i tell him someone have tear it out he shout by god it s that damn handley the sneak and late in the same week they both come together to examine the register fortunately we be alone in the build so few people nowadays be interest even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other day for they begin to abuse each other in the foul language red thrust out his tawny beard handley glower under his suddenly rumple black hair they actually bristle le rouge et le noir violent men both red always be morose yet that day the dapper handley be the loud of the two but for my presence they would have be at each others throat during the quarrel i learn what the trouble be from the accusation each hurl at the other the beech pasture have suddenly become valuable there s a fine granite quarry there and granite s come back for public build both men know it be in the norberg family hold but to which of the cousin do it belong anta or freya fortunately i know almost exactly what the will have say it begin with a preamble of course this explain that the judge of probate of essex county or appoint three free holder of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate after the usual honorable sir it go on to say that there have be set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privilege to the well and bake oven and to one third of the cellar i can show you the cellar when we go up also one cow right and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she bring with her a dower namely the beech pasture and i remember that the whole of the privilege not count the beech pasture be value at twenty pound i wish you could have see the crest fall on these two spar coxcomb when i tell them that obviously the pasture belong to their wive jointly that battle scene ridiculous a it be remain in my mind a disturb picture of bad blood to be far heighten with illicit if buccolic color for on a subsequent day i saw handley escort anta red s wife up on dogtown common i felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence not that i intentionally go unperceived but the boulder up there be very high and i be a small woman one other cause of jealousy between them i must tell you paint gloomy and unkempt a red mciver be he be much the well painter i suppose handley know it if red have a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his picture in rockport you may say this have little pertinence but gentleman remember that all this prepare my mind alert my intelligence by such touch the pattern take shape you would call these the motif of crime i would call them the pattern of life perhaps even the design of destiny yet with all this knowledge i have nothing of substance to unravel our case a you would call it till yesterday one month ago on the th of october be the opening of the gun season in massachusetts not much to shoot but there be a few pheasant rabbit too if you care for them which most of the folk around here haven t the sense to appreciate any more than they have the sense to eat mussel that be the day red be say to have go away oh yes he d talk about do so in fact he often disappear from time to time off to paint the sea aboard a dragger out from gloucester anta his wife never seem to mind i suppose these absence give her more clearance for her embrace with cousin handley anyhow i wasn t surprise early that morning to see handley himself cross from dogtown common road to the back road no he didn t have his gun which he should have it would have be a good excuse for his be there at all i myself have be up there by seven o clock after mushroom since there d be a week of rain which have stop early that morning and the day be a clear a sandwich glass

his body smash on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance haney hop that nobody notice his sudden pallor a he felt the blood drain from his cheek he mutter something about how terrible it be and walk with deliberate slowness to the elevator once inside his apartment he pour a drink with trembling hand and flop limply in a chair after a while he begin to feel well about it

cl24,cl24,imaginative,mystery,2446,about halfway back pop grope against a wall and stop pull away two loosely nail wide board at one end and go through c mon he whisper floor level s about three foot down so don t fall i go through and down into pitch darkness he say jist stay still i ll pull the board back and then get u a light jist stay where you be i jist stay where i be while he fumble around and then walk away a moment late he strike a match and light a candle and i could see it be a big room empty except for a few thing of pop s at the far end a wooden crate on which stand the candle a spread out blanket and an unroll bindle i look back over my shoulder while i go to join him he d hang another half of a blanket over the board window so no light would show through i take the pint bottle from my pocket and hand it over a i sit down beside him on the spread blanket you first i say he drink and hand it back nice place i tell him listen i get a buddy i travel with real nice guy name larry i know where he be right near here could he join the party and sleep here tonight too we ll both be blow town tomorrow so we win t be move in on you he hesitate a second look at the bottle before he say sure sure and i reassure him he ll bring a bottle too and i ll get another one or maybe two while i m out you can work on this one while i m go kill it if you want i take a short swallow from it myself and hand it to him his sure sure be enthusiastic this time he put the bottle down git over by the window while there s light an i ll put th candle out when yuh come back i ll put it out agin till you re both inside charlie be wait lean against a build front perfect set up i tell him but we get to go back to fifth and get another bottle or two on the way i ll give you the scoop on the way i give him the scoop i buy another pint of sherry and when we get back pop let u in in the dark put back the blanket and then light the candle again i introduce my friend larry to pop and we make ourselves comfortable there be still a little not much leave in the first bottle and we pass it around once and kill it and charlie open his i be remind amusedly by a poem of kenneth patchen s call the murder of two men by a young kid wear lemon color glove which patchen himself read on a record against jazz background the poem consist of only two word the word wait repeat over and over at irregular interval and with different inflection and then the word now and a blare final chord from the jazz group this be the same except that it be the murder of one man by two men and neither of u be wear glove but we could wait all right there be no hurry i say wait wait to charlie and he grin dig the reference we d hear the record together once the second bottle pass a few time pop be take long one but not show the effect yet he seem a drink a when i d first talk to him but no drunk he have a capacity if we d really be try to get him dead drink we d have have to go out for more wine about halfway through the second bottle charlie look at me across pop who be sit between u and ask now i say wait and hand the bottle to pop for his final drink when he hand it back and i have hold of it safely pop be look toward me and i say now to charlie and he swing the short length of lead pipe he d meanwhile take from his pocket once it be a lead pipe cinch there be a sound like the one you produce by flick a watermelon with your finger only loud and pop fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise out cold if not dead and he d never know what hit him he d never know that anything have hit him i reach my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat but charlie say wait and say it sharply not a in the patchen bit but a an order so i stop my hand and look at him he be hold the piece of lead pipe out to me we don t want to know whether he s dead yet i gauge that blow to be borderline to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill you hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he s dead or not that way we ll never know which of u really kill him and which be just the accomplice dig i dig him i saw his point it make sense i take the piece of pipe from charlie s hand and use it hard than he have the thunk be loud anyway and i think i hear bone crack charlie say good boy that do it if mine didn t and we ll never know which all right now i ll give you a hand we straighten pop up and i make sure there be no trace of a heartbeat i nod to charlie let s put him down again the way he be it s a more natural position we do that how do you feel charlie ask me cool i tell him what do you feel nothing well maybe i m exaggerate it be a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stake but let s not talk about it abstractly until we re out of here now first question the bottle shall we take them all with u or leave one take them i say if we leave one we d have to wipe it for fingerprint here s the picture we want to leave for the fuzz whenever the body get find this happen in the middle of a drink bout with another bum if they d be work on a bottle or a jug he d have take it with him right and he d have take the weapon with him too so we take that now he look around i ve be careful about fingerprint how about you same there be the board over the window of course but they re not paint and too rough to take print same go for the rough cement of the ledge besides i doubt if the cop will even try dust they find dead wino every day maybe they win t even autopsy him for the cause of death we can t take a chance on that we ve get to assume they ll decide he be murder and we ve get to keep the picture consistent our hypothetical other bum who kill him would have turn out his pocket let s do that we do that and find a dirty handkerchief some match and fourteen cent in change we take the match they be book match and once they d be touch might retain fingerprint and the change we discuss the candle and decide the hypothetical other bum would have leave it burn to light his way to the window and because he d have no reason to blow it out the candle have be stick on a tin lid so it wouldn t set fire to the crate when it gutter out a fire wouldn t have matter except that it would cause pop to be find sooner he might not be find for day even week otherwise we go once more over every point then triple check be pick up for question by a cop on the way out seem to be the only possible remain danger and we weren t pick up by a cop in fact nobody saw u cop or citizen winsett be a quiet street with no tavern and be completely desert at that hour which if it matter be one a m less than three hour ago we d decide in maxine well s pad on cosmo to commit a trial murder it have go like clockwork almost too smoothly i find myself think and then tell myself that be ridiculous how safe be too safe think like that can get you into a pad pad an hour late we be back in my unpadded pad kill what have be leave of the second pint we decide to leave the third one intact for tomorrow also our plan for me to commit charlie s murder and for him to commit mine but we be really go to do it we shake hand on it we plan ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap note i d tell him everything i d learn about seaton s habit and habitat and he d tell me the score on radic we make the date for two o clock in the afternoon at maxine well s pad charlie would get there early because he have the key from here on in the less charlie and i be see together in public or visit one another s room the well i be dead tire and sleep soundly a far a i know dreamlessly we meet at maxine s and decide we be set to stay a long a it take into or even through the evening to talk thing out charlie have bring food and we d decide on no drink i d bring along the virgin pint from last night but we be go to kill that only when we be through talk i talk first tell him everything i know about seaton and his house and domestic arrangement i draw diagram and floor plan he memorize them thoroughly and then we tear them into tiny piece and flush them down he give me equivalent and even more detail dope on radic include diagram one of the apartment build radic live in and one of the apartment itself he d be there several time back when while he and radic have be friend or at least not enemy it didn t take u a long a we d think it might it be not quite six o clock when we finish and charlie say well i guess that s it shall we flip a coin to see which of u go first or would you rather deal a hand of show down poker or play a game of gin rummy or what wait a minute charlie i say one thing we haven t discuss expense money we ll need some at least if only bus fare to the scene of the crime and if you re a flat break a i be i think we ll have to take the add risk of knock over a fill station or something before we split for one of u to set up an alibi while the other do his dirty work he sigh all right i ll come clean i ve get a little stash for a rainy day and i guess this be rainy enough a couple of hundred if you draw the short straw i ll lend you some bread like fifty buck before i take off to visit my sister in frisco then after i m back another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy solid i say i take a deep breath and the plunge in that case let s not draw i ll go to bat first you d have to wait till seaton s back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris to have her have an alibi for d night so it wouldn t be for day or even a week before you could do anything but your friend manny can go any time he grin and clap me on the shoulder i be hop you d say that willy but i wouldn t have suggest it well in that case i take off tomorrow morning for frisco and in case i bring the money with me

cm02,cm02,imaginative,fiction,2412,the expense and time involve be astronomical however we send a third vessel out a much small and fast one than the first two we have learn much about interstellar drive since a hundred year ago that be all i can tell you about them but the third ship come back several year ago and report that it have find a planet on which human be could live and which be already inhabit by sentient be say hal forget in his enthusiasm that he have not be ask to speak macneff stop pace to stare at hal with his pale blue eye how do you know he say sharply forgive me sandalphon say hal but it be inevitable do not the forerunner predict in his time and the world line that such a planet would be find i believe it be on page macneff smile and say i be glad that your scriptural lesson have leave such an impression how could they not think hal besides they be not the only impression i still bear scar on my back where pornsen my gapt whip me because i have not learn my lesson well enough he be a good impresser that pornsen be be a i grow old and be promote so be he always where i be he be my gapt in the creche he be the dormitory gapt when i go to college and think i be get away from him he be now my block gapt he be the one responsible for my get such low m r s swiftly come the revulsion the protest no not he for i and i alone be responsible for whatever happen to me if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or my dark self do if i die i die because i will it so so forgive me sigmen for the contrary to reality thought please pardon me again sandalphon say hal but do the expedition find any record of the forerunner have be on this planet perhaps even though this be too much to wish find the forerunner himself no say macneff though that do not mean that there may not be such record there the expedition be under order to make a swift survey of condition and then to return to earth i can t tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this be though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere if you volunteer you will be tell where you re go after the ship leave and it leave very soon you need a linguist say hal the ship be huge say macneff but the number of military men and specialist we be take limit the linguist to one we have consider several of your professional because they be lamechians and above suspicion unfortunately hal wait macneff pace some more frown then he say unfortunately only one lamechian linguist exist and he be too old for this expedition therefore a thousand pardon say hal but i have just think of one thing i be marry no problem at all say macneff there will be no woman aboard the gabriel and if a man be marry he will automatically be give a divorce hal gasp and he say a divorce macneff raise his hand apologetically and say you be horrify of course but from our read of the western talmud we urielites believe that the forerunner know this situation would arise make reference to and provision for divorce it s inevitable in this case for the couple will be separate for at the least forty year naturally he couch the provision in obscure language in his great and glorious wisdom he know that our enemy the israelite must not be able to read therein what we plan i volunteer say hal tell me more sandalphon six month late hal yarrow stand in the observation dome of the gabriel and watch the ball of earth dwindle above him it be night on this hemisphere but the light blaze from the megalopolis of australia japan china southeast asia india siberia hal the linguist saw the glitter disc and necklace in term of the language speak therein australia the philippine island japan and northern china be inhabit by those member of the haijac union that speak american southern china all of southeast asia southern india and ceylon these state of the malay federation speak bazaar siberia speak icelandic his mind turn the globe swiftly for him and he visualize africa which use swahili south of the sahara sea all around the mediterranean sea asia minor northern india and tibet hebrew be the native tongue in southern europe between the israeli republic and the icelandic speak people of northern europe be a thin but long stretch of territory call march this be no man s land dispute by the haijac union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred year neither nation would give up their claim on it yet neither wish to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic war so for all practical purpose it be an independent nation and by now have it own organize government unrecognized outside it own border it citizen speak all of the world s survive tongue plus a new one call lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary be derive from the other six and whose syntax be so simple it could be contain on half a sheet of paper hal saw in his mind the rest of earth iceland greenland the caribbean island and the eastern half of south america here the people speak the tongue of iceland because that island have get the jump on the hawaiian american who be busy resettle north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war then there be north america where american be the native speech of all except the twenty descendant of french canadian live on the hudson bay preserve hal know that when that side of earth rotate into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space and somewhere in that enormous light be his apartment but mary would soon no long be live there for she would be notify in a few day that her husband have die in an accident while on a flight to tahiti she would weep in private he be sure for she love him in her frigid way though in public she would be dry eye her friend and professional associate would sympathize with her not because she have lose a beloved husband but because she have be marry to a man who think unrealistically if hal yarrow have be kill in a crash he must have want it that way there be no such thing a an accident somehow all the other passenger also suppose to have die in this web of elaborate fraud to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel have simultaneously agree to die and therefore be in disgrace they would not be cremate and their ash fling to the wind in public ceremony no the fish could eat their body for all the sturch care hal felt sorry for mary he have a time keep the tear from well to his own eye a he stand in the crowd in the observation dome yet he tell himself this be the best way he and mary would no long have to tear and rend at each other their mutual torture would be over mary be free to marry again not know that the sturch have secretly give her a divorce think that death have dissolve her marriage she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list select by her gapt perhaps the psychological barrier that have prevent her from conceive hal s child would no long be present perhaps hal doubt if this happy event would occur mary be a freeze below the navel a he no matter who the candidate for marriage select by the gapt the gapt pornsen he would no long have to see that fat face hear that whine voice hal yarrow say the whine voice and slowly feel himself icy yet burn hal turn there be the squat loose jowled man smile lopsidedly up at him my beloved ward my perennial gadfly say the whine voice i have no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage but i might have know we seem to be bind by love sigmen himself must have foresee it love to you my ward sigmen love you too my guardian say hal choke how wonderful to see your cherish self i have think we would never again speak to each other the gabriel point towards her destination and under one gee acceleration begin to build up towards her ultimate velocity percent of the speed of light meanwhile all the personnel except those few need to carry out the performance of the ship go into the suspensor here they would lie in suspend animation for many year some time late after a check have be make of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others they would sleep while the gabriel s drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfreeze body of the personnel could not have endure upon reach the desire speed the automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which be it journey s end many year late the photon count apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star be close enough to actuate deceleration again a force too strong for unfreeze body to endure would be apply then after slow the vessel considerably the drive would adjust to a one gee deceleration and the crew would be automatically bring out of their suspend animation these member would then unthaw the rest of the personnel and in the half year leave before reach their destination the men would carry out whatever preparation be need hal yarrow be among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out he have to study the record of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo and from the first he face a difficult task the expedition that have discover ozagen have succeed in correlate two thousand siddo word with an equal number of american word the description of the siddo syntax be very restrict and a hal find out obviously mistake in many case this discovery cause hal anxiety his duty be to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen yet if he use all of the little mean at his disposal he would be instruct his student wrongly moreover even get this across would be difficult for one thing the organ of speech of the ozagen native differ somewhat from earthman s the sound make by these organ be therefore dissimilar it be true that they could be approximate but would the ozagenians understand these approximation another obstacle be the grammatical construction of siddo consider the tense system instead of inflect a verb or use an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo use an entirely different word thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu ahai mean to live be in the perfect tense ksu u peli afo and in the future mai teipa the same use of an entirely different word apply for all the other tense plus the fact that siddo not only have the normal to earthman three gender of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual fortunately gender be inflect though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not bear in siddo the system of indicate gender vary accord to tense all the other part of speech noun pronoun adjective adverb and conjunction operate under the same system a the verb
cm03,cm03,imaginative,fiction,2364,this be not for the angel just a matter of run through a logical or deductive chain or decide on some action from some already establish premise no doubt the angel could do that kind of thing a fast a any computer what gabriel be be ask to do now however be to re examine all his basic assumption make value judgment on them and give them new and different power in his mind to govern his motif this be not wholly a reason process a computer can not do it all and even in an angel it take time or perhaps especially in an angel whose assumption have mostly be fix million of year ago be reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however do not make it seem any less long to jack he have already become use to hesperus snap back answer to question almost before jack could get them ask there be nothing he could do but wait the dice be cast at last gabriel speak we misjudge you he say slowly we have conclude that no race a ephemeral a yours could have have time to develop a sense of justice of course we have before u the example of the great race at the galactic center individually they be nearly a mortal a you the difference do not seem very mark to u where it exist but they have survive for long period a race whereas you be young we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half for now it be clear that we be in the wrong you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus be lift hesperus you may speak i do not perceive this essential distinction either first bear hesperus say at once i be only practice a concept that jack teach me call a deal nevertheless you be it agent jack what be the nature of this concept it s a kind of agreement in which each party give something to the other jack say we regard it a fair only when each party feel that what he have receive be a valuable or more valuable than what he have give his heart he discover be pound for instance hesperus agree to help me find my property and i agree to take him to earth between individual this process be call bargain when it be do between race or nation it be call make a treaty and the major part of my mission to your nest be to make a treaty between your race and mine recover the property be much less important strange gabriel say and apparently impossible though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give u hesperus and lucifer jack say show that we do another pause but this one be not nearly a long then it be a matter of pleasure of curiosity of a more alive time yes those could be commodity under this concept but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer be not long out of the nursery visit the earth would not be an offer of worth to those of u who be old this explain a great deal all the more reason then jack say why we must have a treaty we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper live quarter in return for their help in run our fusion reactor but we must know if this be in accordance with your custom and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hand to our hurt but this simply require that they behave in accordance with the dictate of their own nature and respect yours in turn to this we of course agree jack felt a wave of complete elation but in a second it have vanish without a trace what gabriel be ask be that mankind forego all it parochial moral judgment and contract to let the angel serve on earth a it be in heaven regardless of the applicable earth law the angel in turn would exercise similar restraint in respect for the natural preference and nature of the earthman but they have no faintest notion of man s perverse habit of pass and enforce law which be contrary to his own preference and violation of his nature the simple treaty principle that gabriel be ask him to ratify in short be nothing less than total trust nothing less would serve and it might be consider the uncomfortable custom the angel have of think of everything in term of absolute that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war furthermore even the highly train law clerk who be a part of jack s total make up could not understand how the principle could ever be codify almost the whole experience of mankind point toward suspicion not trust a the safe and sane attitude toward all outsider yet there be some precedent for it the history of disarmament agreement for instance have be unreassuringly dismal but the unite state and the union of soviet socialist republic nevertheless do eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other s good intention on this limit question out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerge the present world hegemony of the unite nation suspicion between member state still exist but it be of about the same low order of virulence a the twentieth century rivalry between arizona and california over water supply besides agreement in principle with the petty detail to be thrash out late be commonplace in diplomatic history the trouble with them be that they almost never work and in fact an agreement in principle historically turn out to be a sure sign that neither party really want the quarrel settle suppose that this one be to work there be no question in jack s mind of the good faith on one side at least if mankind could be convince of that it be worth try in fact it have to be try it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth have ever sign secretary hart have teach jack at least partially to be content with small beginning in all diplomatic matter but there be no small way to handle this one he turn back to the screen the crucial conclusive phrase on his lip but he be too late he have lose his audience for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw it seem to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity gradually he realize that the pentagon of angel elder have vanish and that the ritual learn dance of the nursery have be break up the angel in the nursery be zigzag wildly in all direction seemingly at random hesperus what s go on here what s happen your brother have be find they be on their way here where i don t see them the instrument don t show them you can t see them yet jack they ll be in range in a short while jack scan the sky the board and the sky again nothing no there be a tiny pip on the radar and it be get big rapidly if that be the skiff it be make unprecedented speed then the skiff heave into sight just a dot of light at first against the roil blackness and crimson streak of the coal sack through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuit be still attach to it the sail be still unfurl though there be a good many hole in it a langer have predict would be the case by now it be a startle almost numenous sight but even more awesome be the fact that it be trail an enormous comet s tail of angel the skiff be not head for the nursery however it seem unlikely that her crew if either of them be alive could even see the ariadne for they be pass her at a distance of nearly a light year and there would be no chance of signal them without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be go fume helpless he watch them pass him the sail rag though it be still have enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power be pour out from the nursery star he would never have believe without see it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast but where be it go and why be it cause so much agitation among the angel and be follow by so many of them there be only one possible answer but jack s horrify mind refuse to believe it until he have feed the radar plot of the skiff s course into the computer the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn t be argue with however the skiff be head for the very center of the nebula toward that place which jack know now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angel s life and religion it be clear that langer have at last find a way to attract the angel s attention it be equally clear that a of this moment the treaty be off stern chase langer would have to be head off whether he know where he be go or not almost surely he do after all he have have the same set of fact a jack have have to work from and he be an almost frighteningly observant man but not have talk to the angel he have make a wrong turn in his reason somewhere along the line have he decide perhaps that the center of the cloud be a center of government instead of a center of life and faith but it didn t matter now whether he mean to invade the holy of holy or be simply head in that direction by accident if it be intentional it be now also unnecessary and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous jack crawl under the board and restore the six foot of lead line he have excise from the nernst generator switch when he be back on his foot again and about to reinstall the fuse however he hesitate he have to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he have to have it fast but fusion power in the coal sack be what have trigger all the trouble in the first place and he already have an angel aboard hesperus receive i m go to turn my generator back on a i promise to do but i can t take you to earth yet first i ve get to intercept my brother before they get any deep into trouble will you obstruct this or will you help i know it s not part of the bargain and your elder might not like it nobody else can live in your hearth while i be in it hesperus say promptly a for my elder they have already admit that they be wrong if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permit to go there at all therefore of course i will help with a short live sigh of relief jack plug the fuse back in and throw the switch without an instant s transition the green light that mean full fusion power wink on the board always before it have take five minute to of course hesperus be in there from here on out the ariadne be go to be hot than any space cruiser man have ever dream of but since he have fail to anticipate it he lose the five minute anyhow in plot an intercept orbit hesperus don t use this t tau vector trick of yours please
cm04,cm04,imaginative,fiction,2461,ryan heft his bulk up and support it on one elbow he rub his eye sleepily with one huge paw ekstrohm nogol you guy okay nothing wrong with me that couldn t be cure nogol say he didn t say what would cure him he have be explain all during the trip what he need to make him feel like himself his small black eye dart inside the olive oval of his face ekstrohm ryan insist okay well let s take a grind level look at the country around here the facsiport roll open on the landscape a range of bluff hug the horizon the color of decay moss above them the sky be the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis see against neon light snow that cold empty sky be full of fire and light it seem almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blow up by some master photographer this fiery swath be actually only a belt of minor planet almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system these planet be much big nearly all capable of hold an atmosphere but to the infuriation of scientist for no know reason not all of them do this would be the fifth map expedition to the planetoid of yancy in three generation they lay month away from the near earth star by jump drive and no one know what they be good for although it be felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discover much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history how can a planet with so many neighbor be so lonely ryan ask he be the captain so he could ask question like that some can be lonely in a crowd nogol say elaborately what will we need outside ryan ekstrohm ask no helmet the captain answer we can breathe out there all right it just win t be easy this old world lose all of it helium and trace gas long ago nitrogen and oxygen be about it ryan look over there nogol say animal ring the ship think they re intelligent maybe hostile i think they re dead ekstrohm interject quietly i get no read from them at all sonic electronic galvanic all blank accord to these needle they re stone dead ekstrohm you and i will have a look ryan say you hold down the fort nogol take it easy easy nogol confirm i hear a story once about a rookie who get excite when the captain step outside and he couldn t get an encephalographic read on him me i know the mind of an officer work in a strange and unfathomable manner i m not worry about you mi read the dial nogol just about a lug like you read them at all remember when the little hand be straight up that s negative positive result start when it go towards the hand you use to make your mark but i m ambidextrous ryan tell him what he could do then ekstrohm smile and follow the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall the strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insect actually the type of infection that could attack a warm blood mammal be not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred year adequate defense have be find for all basic category he wasn t likely to come down with hot chill and puzzle strip fever they ignore the ladder down to the planet surface and with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance drop to the grind it be day but in the thin atmosphere contrast be sharp between light and shadow they walk from midnight to noon noon to midnight and come to the beast sprawl on it side ekstrohm nudge it with a boot hey this be pretty close to a wart hog uh huh ryan admit one of the best match i ve ever find well it have to happen statistical average and all still it sometimes give you a creepy feel to find a rabbit or a snap turtle on some strange world it make you wonder if this exploration business isn t all some big joke and somebody have be everywhere before you even start the surveyor look sidewise at the captain the big man seldom give out with such thought ekstrohm clear his throat what shall we do with this one dissect it ryan nudge it with his toe follow ekstrohm s example i don t know stormy it sure a hell doesn t look like any dominant intelligent specie to me no hand for one thing of course that s not definite proof no it isn t ekstrohm say i think we d well let it lay until we get a clear picture of the ecological setup around here in the meantime we might be think on the problem all these dead beast represent what kill them it look like we do when we make blastdown but what about our land be lethal to the creature radiation ekstrohm suggest the planet be very low in radiation from mineral deposit and the atmosphere seem to shield out most of the solar output any little dose of radiation might knock off these critter i don t know about that maybe it would work the other way maybe because they have have virtually no radioactive exposure and don t have any r s store up they could take a lot without harm then maybe it be the shockwave we set up or maybe it s sheer xenophobia they curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien like a spaceship maybe the captain admit at this stage of the game anything could be possible but there s one possibility i particularly don t like and that be suppose it be not u that kill these alien suppose it be something right on the planet native to it i just hope it doesn t work on earthman too these critter go real sudden ekstrohm lay in his bunk and think the camp be quiet the earthman make camp outside the spaceship there be no reason to leave the comfortable quarter inside the ship except that face with a possibility of sleeping on solid grind they simply have to get out the camp be a cluster of aluminum bubble ring with a spy web to alert the earthman to the approach of any be each man have a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforce intimacy on board the ship ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listen to the sound of the night on yancey there be a keen of wind and a crack of the freeze grind insect there be on the world but they be freeze solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun the bunk he lay on be much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couch on board yet he know the others be sleeping more soundly now that they have renew their contact with the matter that have birth them to send them rid high vacuum ekstrohm be not asleep now there could be an end to pretend he throw off the light blanket and swing his foot off the bunk to the floor ekstrohm stand up there be no long any need to hide but what be there to do what have change for him he no long have to lie in his bunk all night his eye close pretend to sleep in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read it be small comfort for insomnia ekstrohm never sleep some doctor have inform him he be mistake about this actually they say he do sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forget others admit he be absolutely correct he never sleep his body process only slow down enough for him to dispell fatigue poison occasionally he fell into a wake gritty eye stupor but he never sleep never at all naturally he couldn t let his shipmate know this insomnia would grind him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological ground he have to hide it over the year he have have buddy in space in whom he think he could confide the buddy invariably take advantage of him since he couldn t sleep anyway he might a well stand their watch for them or write their report where the hell do he get off threaten to report any laxness on their part to the captain a man with insomnia have well avoid bad dream of that kind if he know what be good for him ekstrohm have to hide his secret in a camp instead of shipboard hide the secret be easy but the secret itself be just a hard ekstrohm pick up a lightweight no back from the ship s library a book by bloch the famous twentieth century expert on sex he scan a few line on the social repercussion of a celebrate nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldn t seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style on impulse he flip up the heat control on his coverall and slide back the hatch of the bubble ekstrohm walk through the alien glass and look up at the unfamiliar constellation smell the freeze sterility of the thin air behind him his mate stir without wake ekstrohm be startle in the morning by a bang on the hatch of his bubble it take him a few second to put his thought in order and then he get up from the bunk where he have be rest sleeplessly the angry burn red face of ryan greet him okay stormy this isn t the place for fun and game what do you do with them do with what the dead beasties all the dead animal lay around the ship what be you talk about ryan what do you think i do with them i don t know all i know be that they be go go ekstrohm shoulder his way outside and scan the veldt there be no ring of animal corps nothing nothing but wispy grass whip in the keen breeze i ll be damned ekstrohm say you be right now buddy expe doesn t like anybody muck up primary evidence where do you get off ryan ekstrohm demand why pick me for your patsy this have get to be some kind of local phenomenon why accuse a shipmate of be behind this listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt but you aren t exactly the model of a surveyor you know you ve be rid on a pink ticket for six year you know that no ekstrohm say no i didn t know that you ve be hide thing from me and nogol every jump we ve make with you now come this it fit the pattern of secrecy and stealth you ve be involve in what could i do with your lousy dead body what would i want with them all i know be that you be outside the bubble last night and you be the only sentient be who come in or out of our alarm web the tap show that now all the body be miss like they get up and walk away it be not a new experience to ekstrohm no suspicion wasn t new to him at all ryan there be other explanation for the disappearance of the body look for them will you i give you my word i m not try to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition take my word can t you ryan shake his head i don t think i can there s still such a thing a mental illness you may not be responsible ekstrohm scowl don t try anything violent stormy i outweigh you fifty pound and i m fast for a big man i

unusually high a long a her development within her shell live up to expectation and there be no side effect from the pituitary tinker helva would live a reward rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have face a an ordinary normal be however no diagram of her brain pattern no early i q test record certain essential fact about helva that central must eventually learn they would have to bide their official time and see trust that the massive dos of shell psychology would suffice her too a the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressure of her profession a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resource central have to build into their scout ship brain ship be of course long past the experimental stage most babe survive the technique of pituitary manipulation that keep their body small eliminate the necessity of transfer from small to large shell and very very few be lose when the final connection be make to the control panel of ship or industrial combine shell people resemble mature dwarf in size whatever their natal deformity be but the well orient brain would not have change place with the most perfect body in the universe so for happy year helva scoot around in her shell with her classmate play such game a stall power seek study her lesson in trajectory propulsion technique computation logistics mental hygiene basic alien psychology philology space history law traffic cod all the et ceteras that eventually become compound into a reason logical inform citizen not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teacher helva ingest the precept of her condition a easily a she absorb her nutrient fluid she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub conscious level instruction helva s civilization be not without busy do good association explore possible inhumanity to terrestrial a well a extraterrestrial citizen one such group get all incense over shell child when helva be just turn fourteen when they be force to central world shrug it shoulder arrange a tour of the laboratory school and set the tour off to a big start by show the member case history complete with photograph very few committee ever look past the first few photo most of their original objection about shell be override by the relief that these hideous to them body be mercifully conceal helva s class be do fine art a selective subject in her crowd program she have activate one of her microscopic tool which she would late use for minute repair to various part of her control panel her subject be large a copy of the last supper and her canvas small the head of a tiny screw she have tune her sight to the proper degree a she work she absentmindedly croon produce a curious sound shell people use their own vocal cord and diaphragm but sound issue through microphone rather than mouth helva s hum then have a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in it aimless chromatic wander why what a lovely voice you have say one of the female visitor helva look up and catch a fascinate panorama of regular dirty crater on a flaky pink surface her hum become a gurgle of surprise she instinctively regulate her sight until the skin lose it cratered look and the pore assume normal proportion yes we have quite a few year of voice train madam remark helva calmly vocal peculiarity often become excessively irritate during prolong intra stellar distance and must be eliminate i enjoy my lesson although this be the first time that helva have see unshelled people she take this experience calmly any other reaction would have be report instantly i mean that you have a nice sing voice dear the lady amend thank you would you like to see my work helva ask politely she instinctively sheer away from personal discussion but she file the comment away for far meditation work ask the lady i be currently reproduce the last supper on the head of a screw no i say the lady twitter helva turn her vision back to magnification and survey her copy critically of course some of my color value do not match the old master s and the perspective be faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy the lady s eye unmagnified bug out oh i forget and helva s voice be really contrite if she could have blush she would have you people don t have adjustable vision the monitor of this discourse grin with pride and amusement a helva s tone indicate pity for the unfortunate here this will help suggest helva substitute a magnify device in one extension and hold it over the picture in a kind of shock the lady and gentleman of the committee bend to observe the incredibly copy and brilliantly execute last supper on the head of a screw well remark one gentleman who have be force to accompany his wife the good lord can eat where angel fear to tread be you refer sir ask helva politely to the dark age discussion of the number of angel who could stand on the head of a pin i have that in mind if you substitute atom for angel the problem be not insoluble give the metallic content of the pin in question which you be program to compute of course do they remember to program a sense of humor a well young lady we be direct to develop a sense of proportion sir which contribute the same effect the good man chortle appreciatively and decide the trip be worth his time if the investigation committee spend month digest the thoughtful food serve them at the laboratory school they leave helva with a morsel a well sing a applicable to herself require research she have of course be expose to and enjoy a music appreciation course which have include the well know classical work such a tristan und isolde candide oklahoma nozze de figaro the atomic age singer eileen farrell elvis presley and geraldine todd a well a the curious rhythmic progression of the venusians capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerto of the altairians but sing for any shell person pose considerable technical difficulty to be overcome shell people be school to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before make a prognosis balance properly between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people lead them to extricate themselves their ship and personnel from bizarre situation therefore to helva the problem that she couldn t open her mouth to sing among other restriction do not bother her she would work out a method by pass her limitation whereby she could sing she approach the problem by investigate the method of sound reproduction through the century human and instrumental her own sound production equipment be essentially more instrumental than vocal breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sound within the oral cavity appear to require the most development and practice shell people do not strictly speak breathe for their purpose oxygen and other gas be not draw from the surround atmosphere through the medium of lung but sustain artificially by solution in their shell after experimentation helva discover that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone by relax the throat muscle and expand the oral cavity well into the frontal sinus she could direct the vowel sound into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone she compare the result with tape record of modern singer and be not unpleased although her own tap have a peculiar quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique acquire a repertoire from the laboratory library be no problem to one train to perfect recall she find herself able to sing any role and any song which strike her fancy it would not have occur to her that it be curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura a she please it be to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control require by the music attempt if the authority remark on her curious avocation they do so among themselves shell people be encourage to develop a hobby so long a they maintain proficiency in their technical work on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva be unconditionally graduate and instal in her ship the aj her permanent titanium shell be recess behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship the neural audio visual and sensory connection be make and seal her extendibles be divert connect or augment and the final delicate beyond description brain tap be complete while helva remain anesthetically unaware of the proceed when she awake she be the ship her brain and intelligence control every function from navigation to such loading a a scout ship of her class need she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already record in the annals of central world and any situation it most fertile mind could imagine her first actual flight for she and her kind have make mock flight on dummy panel since she be eight show her complete mastery of the technique of her profession she be ready for her great adventure and the arrival of her mobile partner there be nine qualify scout sit around collect base pay the day helva be commission there be several mission which demand instant attention but helva have be of interest to several department head in central for some time and each man be determine to have her assign to his section consequently no one have remember to introduce helva to the prospective partner the ship always choose it own partner have there be another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have be guide to make the first move a it be while central wrangle among itself robert tanner sneak out of the pilot barrack out to the field and over to helva s slim metal hull hello anyone at home tanner wisecrack of course reply helva logically activate her outside scanner be you my partner she ask hopefully a she recognize the scout service uniform all you have to do be ask he retort hopefully no one have come i think perhaps there be no partner available and i ve have no directive from central even to herself helva sound a little self pity but the truth be she be lonely sit on the darken field always she have have the company of other shell and more recently technician by the score the sudden solitude have lose it momentary charm and become oppressive no directive from central be scarcely a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guy bite their fingernail to the quick just wait for an invitation to board you you beautiful thing
cm06,cm06,imaginative,fiction,2378,it would have kill you in the cabin do you have anything for me mercer stammer not know what b dikkat mean and the two nose man answer for him i think he have a nice

thicken and his mind go slack he be wide awake but he do not feel like do anything in that beautiful place among all those companionable and attractive people he sit and smile b dikkat be sterilize his knife mercer wonder how long the super condamine have last him he endure the ministration of the dromozoa without scream or movement the agony of nerve and itch of skin be phenomenon which happen somewhere near him but mean nothing he watch his own body with remote casual interest the lady da and the hand cover woman stay near him after a long time the half man drag himself over to the group with his powerful arm have arrive he blink sleepily and friendlily at them and lapse back into the restful stupor from which he have emerge mercer saw the sun rise on occasion close his eye briefly and open them to see star shin time have no mean the dromozoa feed him in their mysterious way the drug cancel out his need for cycle of the body at last he notice a return of the inwardness of pain the pain themselves have not change he have he know all the event which could take place on shayol he remember them well from his happy period formerly he have notice them now he felt them he try to ask the lady da how long they have have the drug and how much long they would have to wait before they have it again she smile at him with benign remote happiness apparently her many torso stretch out along the grind have a great capacity for retain the drug than do his body she mean him well but be in no condition for articulate speech the half man lay on the grind artery pulsate prettily behind the half transparent film which protect his abdominal cavity mercer squeeze the man s shoulder the half man wake recognize mercer and give him a healthily sleepy grin a good morrow to you my boy that s out of a play do you ever see a play you mean a game with card no say the half man a sort of eye machine with real people do the figure i never saw that say mercer but i but you want to ask me when b dikkat be go to come back with the needle yes say mercer a little ashamed of his obviousness soon say the half man that s why i think of play we all know what be go to happen we all know when it be go to happen we all know what the dummy will do he gesture at the hummock in which the decorticate men be cradle and we all know what the new people will ask but we never know how long a scene be go to take what s a scene ask mercer be that the name for the needle the half man laugh with something close to real humor no no no you ve get the lovely on the brain a scene be just a part of a play i mean we know the order in which thing happen but we have no clock and nobody care enough to count day or to make calendar and there s not much climate here so none of u know how long anything take the pain seem short and the pleasure seem long i m incline to think that they be about two earth week each mercer do not know what an earth week be since he have not be a well read man before his conviction but he get nothing more from the half man at that time the half man receive a dromozootic implant turn red in the face shout senselessly at mercer take it out you fool take it out of me when mercer look on helplessly the half man twist over on his side his pink dusty back turn to mercer and weep hoarsely and quietly to himself mercer himself could not tell how long it be before b dikkat come back it might have be several day it might have be several month once again b dikkat move among them like a father once again they cluster like child this time b dikkat smile pleasantly at the little head which have grow out of mercer s thigh a sleeping child s head cover with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrow over the rest eye mercer get the blissful needle when b dikkat cut the head from mercer s thigh he felt the knife grind against the cartilage which hold the head to his own body he saw the child face grimace a the head be cut he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain a b dikkat dab the wind with a corrosive antiseptic which stop all bleed immediately the next time it be two leg grow from his chest then there have be another head beside his own or be that after the torso and leg waist to toe tip of the little girl which have grow from his side he forget the order he do not count time lady da smile at him often but there be no love in this place she have lose the extra torso in between teratology she be a pretty and shapely woman but the nice thing about their relationship be her whisper to him repeat some thousand of time repeat with smile and hope people never live forever she find this immensely comfort even though mercer do not make much sense out of it thus event occur and victim change in appearance and new one arrive sometimes b dikkat take the new one rest in the everlasting sleep of their burn out brain in a grind truck to be add to other herd the body in the truck thresh and bawl without human speech when the dromozoa strike them finally mercer do manage to follow b dikkat to the door of the cabin he have to fight the bliss of super condamine to do it only the memory of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity make him sure that if he do not ask b dikkat when he mercer be happy the answer would no long be available when he need it fight pleasure itself he beg b dikkat to check the record and to tell him how long he have be there b dikkat grudgingly agree but he do not come out of the doorway he speak through the public address box build into the cabin and his gigantic voice roar out over the empty plain so that the pink herd of talk people stir gently in their happiness and wonder what their friend b dikkat might be want to tell them when he say it they think it exceedingly profound though none of them understand it since it be simply the amount of time that mercer have be on shayol standard year eighty four year seven month three day two hour eleven and one half minute good luck fellow mercer turn away the secret little corner of his mind which stay sane through happiness and pain make him wonder about b dikkat what persuade the cow man to remain on shayol what keep him happy without super condamine be b dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or be he a man who have hop of go back to his own planet some day surround by a family of little cow people resemble himself mercer despite his happiness weep a little at the strange fate of b dikkat his own fate he accept he remember the last time he have eat actual egg from an actual pan the dromozoa keep him alive but he do not know how they do it he stagger back to the group the lady da naked in the dusty plain wave a hospitable hand and show that there be a place for him to sit beside her there be unclaimed square mile of seat space around them but he appreciate the kindliness of her gesture none the less the year if they be year go by the land of shayol do not change sometimes the bubble sound of geyser come faintly across the plain to the herd of men those who could talk declare it to be the breathe of captain alvarez there be night and day but no set of crop no change of season no generation of men time stand still for these people and their load of pleasure be so commingle with the shock and pain of the dromozoa that the word of the lady da take on very remote mean people never live forever her statement be a hope not a truth in which they could believe they do not have the wit to follow the star in their course to exchange name with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all there be no dream of escape for these people though they saw the old style chemical rocket lift up from the field beyond b dikkat s cabin they do not make plan to hide among the freeze crop of transmute flesh far long ago some other prisoner than one of these have try to write a letter his handwriting be on a rock mercer read it and so have a few of the others but they could not tell which man have do it nor do they care the letter scrap on stone have be a message home they could still read the opening once i be like you step out of my window at the end of day and let the wind blow me gently toward the place i live in once like you i have one head two hand ten finger on my hand the front part of my head be call a face and i could talk with it now i can only write and that only when i get out of pain
cn01,cn01,imaginative,adventure,2448,dan morgan tell himself he would forget ann turner he be well rid of her he certainly didn t want a wife who be fickle a ann if he have marry her he d have be ask for trouble but all of this be rationalization sometimes he wake up in the middle of the night think of ann and then could not get back to sleep his plan and dream have revolve around her so much and for so long that now he felt a if he have nothing the easy thing would be to sell out to al budd and leave the country but there be a stubborn streak in him that wouldn t allow it the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poison him be hard work he find that if he be tire enough at night he go to sleep simply because he be too exhaust to stay awake each day he find himself think less often of ann each day the hurt be a little dull a little less poignant he have plenty of work to do because the summer be unusually dry and hot the spring produce a small stream than in ordinary year the grass in the meadow come fast now that the warm weather be here he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spend most of his wake hour along the ditch in his meadow he have no idea how much time budd would give him in any case he have no intention of be catch asleep so he carry his revolver in it holster on his hip and he take his winchester with him and lean it against the fence he stop every few minute and lean on his shovel a he study the horizon but nothing happen each day drag out with monotonous calm when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and stride to his rifle it could be some kind of trick budd have think up no one walk in this country least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew morgan watch the two figure for a time puzzle when they be close and he saw that one be a woman he be more puzzle than ever he clean his shovel leave it against the fence pick up his winchester and start downstream his visitor have crawl through the south fence and be cross the meadow angle toward the house now he saw

ranch that be frame dark gray against the black hill then at last the darkness begin to dissolve a bold line of violet break loose from the high ridge of the mountain follow by feather of red that sweep the last star from the sky the wan light spread over the grind and the valley reveal in the first glimmer the contour of tree and fence and palely shadow gully they have be see a soon a they leave the ranch pick out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eye of two men post a few hundred yard away in the windless shelter of the tree the two men whip their horse into town and fling themselves up the step of the saloon cry their intelligence the men in pettigrew s be tire from a night s drink their face red and baggy but the liquor have flush their courage they greet the news angrily a though they have be cheat of purpose lester hear their muttering saw their eye reveal their desire he work his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice come out of his

the river he say calmly what would you have do in montero s moccasin let old knife come up and kill you and your people or would you steer him on someone else he shake his head mr manuel do that in

a small indian dive at montero who catch him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt it sound like a man kick a melon above me a dark rider be whip his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bale although my shoot kill his horse he roll off the bale on top of me i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil his eye be dark fluid fearful and he give a sigh a my knife go in come over the wall

warrior old and young wheel and twist their pony frantically from side to side only to be tumble bleed from their saddle by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient hawkins others badly wound grip hand in mane knee in belly hold on a long a possible and then weak from ghastly wound slip sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be break under the slash hoof some gracefully soar from the back of their wound scream mount to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their heart or tear their gut none of them reach our wall again the few survivor grudgingly turn away in the distance we could hear the drum and the wail of the death song

finally regain her balance and get up in the saddle her hat have come off and fall behind her shoulder hold by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he have at any time before he have forget that she be so pretty but her prettiness be what he have notice first and all the other thing have come afterward cruelty meanness self will he have know woman like that one woman in particular and one have be too many he watch the girl until she have go into the tree and wait until he couldn t hear the sound of her horse any long then go up to where the child be sleeping they weren t sleeping of course but they think they be do him a favor by pretend he hadn t show up too well in their eye let himself be browbeat by a woman they expect great thing from him regardless of how try the circumstance and they be disappoint and determine not to show it they lay a little too stiffly with their eye strain to stay close go to sleep he say both of you there s well thing to do than listen to something like that i ll be down at the creek finish the dish if you want me he find the pan where he have drop it and carry it back down to the stream the coyote be call again and he hop that this time there would be no other sound to interrupt it not tonight at any rate he have a feel that the girl mean trouble if she do he could stand it well in the light he scrub absent mindedly at the pan and reflect on how thing have turn out that afternoon when they have pull up in front of the break down ranch house his hop have be high already some of the pain have go from amelia s death not all of it there would still be plenty of moment of regret and sadness and guilty relief but they be start a new life and they have almost everything they need land a house two whiteface bull three horse the land wasn t all wilson have expect of it six hundred and forty acre the old man back in st louis have say good grass good water well the grass be there though in some place the grind be too steep for a cow to get to it the water be there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard and there be a house livable perhaps but badly in need of repair in the last analysis though wilson have little cause to complain the place have be cheap just the little he have leave after amelia s burial and it would serve it purpose there be only one place where jake carwood s description have go badly awry the peace and quiet it hadn t start out that way and he have a feel thanks to the girl that thing would get bad before they get well they have the house clean up by noon and wilson send the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horse he stand on the porch and watch him struggle with the heavy harness and finally go over to help him kathy be already in the wagon they be go to town and they be both excite wilson back the team into the trace and wish they weren t go to town at all he have an uneasy feel about it that girl last night what be her name judith pierce it be the only thing about her that be the least bit hard to remember he finish with the team and fill his pipe and stand look about him he have spend two hour rid around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it be even less invite than judith pierce have make it seem there be brush and stand of pine that no grass could grow under and place so steep that cattle wouldn t stop to graze but there be water there be an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of tree feed by a half dozen spring that pop out of the grind above the hillside orchard yes there be plenty of water too much and that be probably the trouble there be track of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acre the first part of the road be steep but it level off after the second bend and curl gradually into the valley it be hot once they reach the flat and dry but the grass be well a warm breeze play across it move it like wave a red tail hawk fly in behind them and stay there watch for any snake or rabbit that they might stir up from the side of the road it take them an hour before they come to the first house of kelseyville the town be about what wilson expect one main street with it row of false front build a water tower a few warehouse a single hotel all dusty and sunbaked the place be quiet
cn06,cn06,imaginative,adventure,2279,such be my state of mind that i do not question the possibility of this under the circumstance i be only too will to confess all i be nearly thirty at the time i go to the hall in the afternoon only on these preliminary matter it be dark and i sense very large only the counter at one end be light by a long fluorescent tube suspend directly above it sometimes i be aware of people move about in the darkness i would turn away from my write in the hope of get a good look at them but i never quite succeed a glimpse of three of four vague figure at the most drift here and there squat a if wait the pulse glow of a cigarette since they could see me but i not them their presence in the hall disturb me the clerk pay them no attention this impress me until i realize how limit be his sphere of influence his job simply consist in register new men when the phone ring he answer it his authority extend to the far edge of the counter no far none of the men hang around the hall bother to speak to him baldness be attack his pate he speak to me in a gruff voice an affectation which quite belie his personality he wear his white shirt open at the neck reveal a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath it be obvious that he wish himself different from the sort of person he think he be but it be not easy for him and he often slip when one of the men in the hall behind u spat on the floor and scrap his boot over the gob of spittle i notice how the clerk wince i felt certain he be really a spineless little man his hat the cause of his baldness hang on a hook on the wall and underneath it i could see his tie knot ready to be slip over his head a black badge of fray respectability that ought never to have leave his neck the morning s tabloid be on the counter and a stack of dog eared men s magazine on a shelf in the office behind the counter be a small radio dial permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercial and cheap popular music everything about the clerk be trivial once press him i learn that his job be only part time in the afternoon when nothing go on in the hall notice my disappointment he attempt to salvage what scrap and shred of authority he felt might still be cling to his person with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air when he saw me come he turn his radio off he make a show of rearrange my form on the shelf he would pick up the ring phone with study negligence then bark into it with gruff importance what limit knowledge he possess he force upon me in the morning i be inform fluorescent tube similar to the one above the counter illuminate the entire hall they and the two large fan which i could dimly see a daylight filter through their vent down at the far end of the hall could be turn on by a master switch situate inside the office he point out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believe that he would let deed follow word i be show instead a batch of white ticket of the sort hand out he tell me every morning now here be something of obvious importance to me yet when i reach for the ticket he snatch them away from my hand he couldn t afford to have anyone mess around with them he say each of those ticket be of great value to it rightful recipient i withdraw my hand late i would remember what this pompous little man have tell me about the worth of a ticket have nothing else to do except wait for my form to be process i give myself over to speculation concern the hall itself when suitably light what would it look like the presence of the two exhaust fan seem to indicate that the hall could become crowd for air one afternoon upon receive permission and the necessary instruction from the clerk i have visit the toilet adjoin the hall by count the number of stall and urinal i attempt to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time for although i have cross a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extend i could observe the two fan down at the end but their size in themselves mean nothing to me a long a i have no measure of comparison i have for some time be hop in vain for one of the dim figure to pass between the fan vent and myself i know that three or four of them be almost always present in the hall but what they be do and exactly where i could not tell it be i felt possible that they be men who have receive no ticket for that day have remain in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corner farthest remove from the counter with it overhead light this light do not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eye be hinder rather than aid by the dim daylight enter through the fan vent when i try to pick out whatever might be lie or squat on the floor below also the clerk appear to disapprove of my frequent curious glance back over my shoulder no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at time quite sharply in order to bring back my attention and i have hardly finish my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the light in that place like the hall light control from the switch in the office flick off and on impatiently this sort of petty vigilance annoy me i felt certain it be self appoint it spring from a type of mentality i d encounter often enough but certainly have not expect to find here i decide to see no more of the clerk until the process of my paper be complete i felt strongly attach to the hall however and hardly a day pass when i do not go to look at it from a distance i live in a state of suspense because of it i could not cling to my past nor do i wish to i have sign it off on the form my future lay solely with the hall yet what do i know about the hall at this point although i have be inside it i have not yet see it function i wish to prepare myself but do not even know what sort of clothe i ought to be wear i do not despair however far from it i be constantly search for clue around the neighborhood of the hall though only a relatively short walk separate it from my own part of town it character be wholly foreign to me large warehouse flank the street on which the hall front the river be only a few block away but an unbroken line of pier prevent me from see it sometimes i notice the top of ship mast and funnel reach above the pier roof the sound issue from beyond winch whirring men shout indicate great activity and excite me the hall on the other hand appear lifeless and desert on these long waterfront afternoon it resemble nothing i d ever see before it front be windowless but irregularity in the masonry might be an indication that window now blind have once look out upon the street i keep circle the block hop to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall but it be not a tall structure and other build conceal it for week i wander about this neighborhood of warehouse and garage truck terminal and taxi repair shop gasoline pump and longshoreman s lunch counter yet never do i cease to feel myself a stranger there i return to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk a i have expect he insist that my visit to the hall would do nothing to far the process of my application meanwhile spring have pass well into summer at last when i put it to him directly the clerk be force to admit that the delay in my case be unusual when i ask him what if anything i could do about it he surprise me by refer me to the director of the hall i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten o clock the clerk impress this upon me that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o clock when i go for my interview with the director i saw why although it be dark a usual i could see that the hall have only recently contain a great many people cigarette butt litter the floor the big fan be go draw from the large room the remnant of stale smoke which drift about in pale stratum underneath the ceiling i have felt the draft they be make while mount the stair the staircase itself seem still to be echo the heavy footfall of many men i stop by the counter no one be behind it but in the rear wall of the office i notice for the first time a door which have be leave partially open past it i could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor the director s office i rap my knuckle on the counter the director come to the door i be at once disappoint although just what i have expect him to look like i could not have explain he be a man in his late forty with gray hair of medium height he look dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and green tint soft collar he wear perforate white top shoe they somehow make me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment but he come toward me sedately enough show me around the counter offer me a seat inside his office then walk to a file cabinet and get out my application i have the impression that he have read my form perhaps several time he do not look at them now a he lower himself on the chair behind his desk i wonder what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the work of the hall he speak in a voice a immaculate a his appearance why have i register beg my pardon he must express his astonishment over see a person of my background apply at the hall he have look over my form and be impress by what he have see there indeed my scholastic qualification be such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them be i sure he ask that i know what i be apply for what sort of men i would come into contact with at the hall these question do not surprise me i felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom move beyond the counter that the hall to them be a jungle a dark and unwelcome place though i doubt that he would understand me i tell the director my motif for apply i have always i say hanker after work hard with my hand this desire i go on grow voluble a my conviction be arouse have mount at such a rate recently that i now find it realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing to this effect i have already sever all connection which bind me to my former existence

a he fight the steering wheel he seem very please with himself a though some intricate scheme be work out exactly a he have plan along with this self satisfaction however joyce sense a grow tension it pour out of him like an electric current a feel that the muscle and nerve of his fine draw body be coil for action and that that action would be all that he anticipate joyce have see him like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion that be the day that he have practically mop up the main street of big sand with aaron mcbride field bos for the highland oil gas company tom have be lay for aaron mcbride for a long time just wait to catch him out of line mcbride give him his opportunity when he show up in town with a pistol on his hip he have a legitimate reason for wear it it be payday for highland and he be pack a lot of money back into the oil field moreover a long a the weapon be carry openly the sheriff s office have make no previous issue of it so what s this all about he demand when lord confront him i m not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit it be the wrong thing to say by fail to do a he be tell instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to his car he have play into lord s hand the trouble be that he have virtually have to protest the deputy have force him to by his manner of accost him

highland swindle you and i help em do it but you re all wrong man i m no lawyer i just do what i m tell and uh huh an that could mean trouble with a fella that s workin for crook so you get rid of that pistol right now mi ter mcbride you do that or take you out a permit right now mcbride couldn t do either of course not immediately a the deputy demand not without a face save respite of at least a few minute to do so would make his job well nigh impossible oil field worker be a rough tough lot how could he exert authority over them make them toe the line a he have to if he knuckle under to this small town clown i ll get around to it a little late he mumble desperately just a soon a i go to the bank and huh uh now mi ter mcbride say lord and he lay a firmly restrain hand on the field bos s arm it be strictly the deputy s game but mcbride have go too far to throw in now he could only play the last card in what be probably the world s cold deck he fling off lord s hand and attempt to push past him inadvertently shove him into a storefront it be practically the last move that mcbride make of his own volition lord slug him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost press against his spine then a he double gasp vomiting the breakfast he have so lately eat lord straighten him with an uppercut a rabbit punch redouble him and then there be a numb blow to the heart and another gut

deadline come and pass and the men who have scoff at the warn laugh with satisfaction for with a single exception nothing have happen to them the exception be an iron mountain settler name william lewis after walk out to his corral that morning he d be amaze to see the dust puff up in front of his foot a split second late the distant crack of a rifle have sound he d mount up immediately and race with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he d estimate the shoot have come but he have find all of the thicket and point of cover desert there have be no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone have be near lewis be a man who have make a full time job of cow steal he hadn t even pretend to be farm his spread his land have never be plow he have do his rustle openly and boast about it he have receive both first and second anonymous notice and each time he have accuse his neighbor of write them he have curse at them and threaten them he be a man those neighbor testify late who didn t have a friend in the world william lewis make the round of all who live near him again that august morning after a bullet land at his foot and once more he accuse and threaten everyone i ll be ready next time he rag i ll be shootin right back he have his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happen again this time lewis have his own rifle in his hand and he throw some answer fire back at the mysterious far off shoot then spend most of the day search out the area he find nothing but he still refuse to give up and move out just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin coward face to face he explode that s all i ask he never get that chance for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aim a little high the third time a bullet smash directly into the center of william lewis chest he slump against a log fence rail then try to lift himself two more shot follow in quick succession drop him limp and huddle on the grind an inquest be hold and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous note the county coroner estimate that the shoot have be do from a distance of yard rumor of the offer tom horn have make at the stockgrowers association meet have leak out by then and a a grand jury investigation of the murder get underway the prosecute attorney a colonel baird order that the tall stock detective be summon for question it take some time to locate horn he be finally find in the bat hole region of natrona county two county away prosecutor baird immediately assume he be hide out there after the shoot and begin prepare an indictment but that indictment be never make for tom horn it turn out have a number of rancher and cowboy witness ready and will to swear with straight face that he have be in bat hole the day of the kill the former scout s alibi couldn t be shake the authority have to release him he immediately ride on to cheyenne throw a ten day drink spree and drop some very strong hint among friend dead center at three hundred yard that coroner say he d grin three shot in that fella fore he hit the grind you reckon there s two men in this state can shoot like that publicly he deny everything privately he create and magnify an image of himself a a hire assassin for a blood chill ring of terror to the very sound of his name be the tool he need for the job he d promise to do tom horn be soon back at work give his secret employer their money s worth a good many beef hungry settler be accept the death of william lewis a proof that the warn note be not idle threat the company herd be be raid less often and cabin and soddy all over the range be stand desert but there be other homesteader who pass the lewis murder off a a personal grudge kill the work of one of his neighbor the rustle problem be by no mean solve even in the very area where the shoot have be do cattle be still disappear for less than a dozen mile from the unplowed land of the dead man live another settler who have ignore the warn that his existence might be foreclose on a blatant and defiant rustler name fred powell fred be mighty crude about the way he take in cattle his own hire man andy ross mention late everyone know it but he sort of act like he didn t care who know it even after them note come even after he d hear about lewis even after he d be shoot at a couple o time hisself on the morning of september powell and ross rise at dawn and begin their day s work haying time be close at hand and they need some strong branch to repair a hay rack harness a team to a buckboard they drive out to a willow line creek about a half mile off then climb down and begin chop andy ross have just start swing an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sound he look around in surprise then notice that fred powell be clutch his chest the hire man run over to help his bos my god i m shoot powell gasp and he collapse and die instantly ross have no intention of search for the assassin he heave the dead man onto the buckboard yell and lash at the team and get out of there fast but he bring back the sheriff and several deputy and to the lawman the entire affair seem a repetition of the lewis kill a detail scour of the entire area reveal nothing beyond a ledge of rock that might have be the rifleman s hide place there be no track of either hoof or boot not even an empty cartridge case could be find once again tom horn be the first and most likely suspect and he be bring in for question immediately once again he shake his head keep his face expressionless and his voice very calm and have a strongly support alibi ready late rid in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional lady of cheyenne he lay claim to the kill with the vague insinuation he make exterminatin cow thief be just a business proposition with me he d blandly announce and i sort o get a corner on the market tom a friend ask him once how come you bushwhack them rustler they wouldn t o stand no chance with you in a plain straight out shoot down he have lot of friend then a always even a he become widely know a a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seem proud to call him a friend no man s name bring more cheer when it be announce in a rodeo well he explain s posin you be a nester swingin the long rope which would you be most scairt of a dry gulchin or a shoot down yeah i can see that the friend be force to agree but well it just don t seem sportin somehow sportin the tall sunburnt rustler hunter star in amazement sportin he echo again in soft wonder i see a lot o thing in my time i find a trooper once the apache have spread eagle on an ant hill and another time we run across some teamster they d catch tie upside down on their own wagon wheel over little fire until their brain be explode right out o their skull i hear o texas cattleman wrappin a cow thief up in green hide and lettin the sun shrink em and squeeze him to death but there s one thing i never see or hear of one thing i just don t think there be and that s a sportin way o killin a man after the first two murder the warn note be rarely ignore the lesson have be learn the example be plain when fred powell s brother in law charlie keane move into the dead man s home the anonymous letter writer take no chance on charlie take up where fred have leave off and waste no time on a first notice if you don t leave this country within day your life will be take the same a powell s be this be the message find tack to the cabin door keane leave within three day all through albany and laramie county other men be do the same house of settler who d treat the company herd a a natural resource free for the take be sit empty with weed grow high in their yard the small half heartedly tend field of men who d spend more time rustle cattle than farm be lie fallow no cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peer to free him any long jury judge and executioner be rid the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west have believe long outdated for three straight year tom horn patrol the southern wyoming pasture and how many men he kill after lewis and powell if he kill lewis and powell will never be know it be possible although highly doubtful that he kill none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claim every unsolved murder in the state it be also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shoot down the hundred of men with which his legend credit him for that legend be grow explosively rumor be insist he receive a price of a man the best evidence be that he receive a monthly wage of about very good money in an era when top hand work for and find rumor have it he slip two small rock under each victim s head a a sort of trademark a detail search of old coroner s report fail to substantiate this in the slight one thing be certain his method be effective so effective that after a time even the warn notice be often unnecessary the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glass have be see rid that way be enough to frighten three rustle homesteader out of the upper laramie country in a single week my reputation s my stock in trade tom mention more than once he evidently couldn t foresee that it might be his downfall in the end he have make himself the personification of the devil to the homesteader but to the cattleman who have be face bankruptcy from rustle loss and to the cowboy who have be face with lay off a few year early he be become a vastly different type of legendary figure such rancher a coble and clay and the bosler brother carry him on their book a a cowhand even while he be receive a much large salary from party unknown he make their spread his headquarters and he help out in their roundup in the cow camp tom horn be regard a a hero a the same kind of champion he be when he enter and invariably win the local rodeo the hand and their boss saw him a a lone knight of the range wag a dedicate crusade against a lawless new society that be threaten a beloved way of life the wail guitar strum minstrel of the cattle kingdom make up song about him by rustle loss have be drive down to the low level ever see in wyoming

cn15,cn15,imaginative,adventure,2318,early in november the cloud lift enough to carry out the assign mission and sweeney squadron put it first mark on the combat record every plane that could fly be send into the air cricket take eight ship and go south across the strait and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan anything the enemy fly or float be his target fleischman with eight be to patrol the leyte gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they get to the ship greg himself take two flight with todman lead the second to patrol and look for target of opportunity around ormoc on the east coast of leyte each plane carry two five hundred pound bomb a weapon carrier take greg todman belton banjo ferguson and walter and the others the two mile from the bivouac area to the strip it be a rough long ride through the mud and pot hole no one have much to say the sky glower down at them there be a feel that this mission would be cancel like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever the truck drop them off at the various revetment spread through the jungle donovan snatch greg s chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost run to the plane with it his face be dark a the sky above it a he stand on the wing and wait for his pilot greg climb into the cockpit feel a if he have never be in one before but his hand and those of donovan move automatically adjust and arrange in the check out procedure i ve get her a neat a i can donovan say a he drop the strap of the seton harness over greg s shoulder but this goddamn climate it s for carabao not airplane we ll make out don t you worry chief greg reply wonder if he himself believe it yeah see you donovan say a he jump off the wing the expression be his trade mark his open sesame to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return at the prearrange time greg start the engine and taxi out from the time the chock be pull until the plane be out of sight he know donovan would keep his back to the strip he wonder where the superstition have originate that it be bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission yet long before the schedule time for return donovan would be watch for every speck in the sky greg rumble down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven member of his flight fell in behind him the dark brown bomb hang under each wing look large and powerful the pilot head look ridiculously small the control tower give him immediate take off permission and the clean roar of the engine that take him off the rough strip speak well of the skill of donovan greg s mission be the last to leave and a he circle the ship off tacloban he saw the cloud be drop down again to the west the dark green hill of leyte be lose in the cloud about halfway up their slop underneath him the sea be a dark and muddy gray water splash against his windshield a he lead the flight in and out of shower the metal strip they have take off from be coal black against the green jungle around it he possess the fighter pilot s horror of bad weather and instrument fly and he wonder if the ceiling do drop whether he and the other flight would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory he shiver in the warm cockpit the overcast be solid above him a far a he could see there be no hole to climb through it they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separate leyte from samar and hope that it didn t close in before they return greg push the radio button on his throttle todman let s try to go under this stuff stay in close and we ll go up the valley roger sweeney todman call back and pull his four in and slightly above greg greg take the formation wide around three a attack bomber that be head north over the gulf he drop down to five hundred foot swing a little north of the city of tacloban and punch into the opening that show against the mountain the valley be only a few hundred yard wide with just about room enough for a properly perform hundred and eighty degree turn it be only a fifteen minute flight but before it be through greg felt himself develop a case of claustrophobia the ceiling stay solid above them at about eight hundred foot and at time the sheer cliff seem about to close in if the other pilot be worry they do not show it the formation remain perfect when the sea be visible ahead of them the relief be a great a if the sun have come out he spread the flight out and lead them across a point of land and then down the coast although they draw light grind fire they saw no sign of activity once todman think he have spot a tank and go down to investigate while greg cover him somebody beat u to it todman say over the radio a he come back up in formation visibility continue to be limit and greg be never able to get above a thousand foot it be frustrate his earphone be constantly full of the sound of enemy contact make by other flight he think once that he identify the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claim a kill but greg s area remain a placid a a florida dawn finally a time begin to run out he head into ormoc and glide bomb a group of house that intelligence have think might contain japanese supply the low cloud make bombing difficult there be not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run the accuracy be deplorable one of greg s bomb hang up and he be mile from the target before he could get rid of it only one of the flight score a direct hit and the rest blow up jungle with their load of bomb go the plan move swiftly and easily greg go up tight against the ceiling and lead them back to their pass to home mercifully it be still open like a man make a deep dive greg take full breath and plunge back into the valley he be about to make a gas check on his flight when todman s voice break in sweeneys three bogy twelve o clock level greg s eye flick up from his instrument panel he saw them speck against the gray but close fast they be head straight for each other on a collision course friend or enemy the same old question and only a few second to answer it zero todman say excitedly and hopefully and then he think todman might be right his mind flick through the mental picture he have from the hour of aircraft identification he narrow the shape down to two either a zero or a u s navy type aircraft if it be the enemy tactically his position be correct japanese aircraft be strong on maneuverability american on speed and firepower his present maximum altitude up against the overcast give him the opportunity to exploit his advantage but it also make him conspicuous to the enemy if it be the enemy and he hadn t be spot already but the close aircraft show no sign of deviate from their original course in second greg make his decision he push the radio button sweeney blue hit the deck lot of throttle todman you take the one on the leave i ll take the middle belton the one on the right if they re jap let s make sure first greg have the stick forward and the throttle up before he hear the two rogers the plan light with most of the gas burn out respond beautifully greg s airspeed indicator be over when he level off just above the tree the oppose aircraft continue to come on they appear to be the enemy greg wish the air corp have continue to camouflage plan there be of course no way for the other plan to get by them it be a box but they could turn and escape to the east greg push the radio button again todman drop your second element back if any of u miss they can pick up the piece now let s make sure they re jap even a he say it greg know they have find the enemy the shape be unmistakable and the rise sun be show up slightly bright pinpoint in the gray gloom greg slap his hand across the switch that turn on the gun and gun camera and gun sight the circle with the dot in the center show up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him his hand shake arm your gun sweeneys they re jap they re jap come a high pitch voice greg to sweeney blue one pass only no turn you ll bust your as in this canyon that s an order he move the flight over against one wall it give them all a chance to make a high speed climb turn attack and a break away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight turn recovery if the turn be too tight a barrel roll would bring them out a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be do greg slam his throttle to the fire wall and ram up the rpm and the engine respond a if it have be wait the clearly identifiable enemy continue on a if no one else be around they haven t see u greg yell to himself over the engine noise they haven t see u he hit the radio button now sweeneys now let s take em home he haul back on the stick and felt his cheek sag out of the corner of his eye he watch his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him perfect he think with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be do just like shoot at a duck while perform a half gainer from a dive board he tighten his turn his nose up it be go to be dangerous eight aircraft in this small box please dear god make my pilot good he pray he take a lead on the enemy use a distance of five of the radius in his circular sight and then add another the enemy do not veer it do not seem possible that they hadn t be spot blind fool now greg s finger close on the stick trigger the plane rumble and slow six red line etch their way into the gray and vanish a if draw by a wire the enemy fly into them greg tighten his turn until the plane shudder luck be with him his burst hold for a second on the engine section of the plane the jap s propeller fly off in piece a large piece of engine cowling vanish it be all greg have time to see his maneuver for the shoot have place him near the overcast almost invert and head up into the cloud his speed be drop rapidly if he spin out now he would join his opponent on the grind wingman stay clear he pray he push stick and rudder and enter the overcast on his back he fight the panic of vertigo he have no idea which be up and which be down he hold the control where they have be sweat pop out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip his air speed drop until he think he would spin out

young and healthy man just out of college find interest i have a one room studio which overlook an ancient courtyard fill with flower and plant blooming everlastingly in the southern sun i have come

care of my normal expense and give me time to paint i accept the arrangement turn out to be excellent i love the city and i particularly love the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras i have see two of them and we would soon be in another city wide joyous celebration with romance in the air and when you take a walk you never know what adventure or pair of sparkle eye be wait around the next corner the very face of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure it be a if they could hardly wait to get into their costume cover their face with mask and go adventure my uncle and i be not too close socially because of the difference in our age sometimes i wonder vaguely what he do about woman for my aunt by blood have die some year ago but neither of u say anything one monday morning i saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her a my new aunt they be marry over the week end though he be easily sixty and she could not have be even thirty she look more like twenty five or six it be really a may and december combination my new aunt be perhaps three or four year old than i and it have be a long time since i have see a gorgeous a woman who ooze sex there be something about the contour of her face her smile that be like new orleans sunshine the way she hold her head the way she walk there be scarcely anything she do which do not fascinate me her leg be the full sexy kind full body like a rare wine and just a tantalize to the appetite the calf be magnificent the ankle perfect you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her physical aspect but i be an artist accustom to study the physical body the true artist be like one of those scientist who from a single bone can reconstruct an animal s entire body the artist look at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind s eye the clothe drop away and he see her a she really be and that be the way i first saw her when my uncle bring her into his antique store that she impress me instantly be obvious i be aware that when our eye meet we both quickly avert them i think i saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheek true she be my aunt marry to an uncle relate to me only by marriage but why she have marry a man twice her age and more perhaps i do not know or much care she be stand with her back to the glass door her form be silhouette and with the strong light i could see the outline of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admire a it be in so many affair of the heart a man and a woman meet and something click something click in this instance but i treat her circumspectly and i felt that she know it for we both keep our distance when she appear at the store to help out for a few hour even my look at her be surreptitious lest my uncle notice it and then i become aware that she too glance at me surreptitiously i felt that her eye be undress me a if she be a painter and i a nude model i dismiss these feel a wishful think but i could not get it out of my head that we have a strong physical attraction for one another and we both fear to dwell on it because of our relationship when our eye meet the air be fill with an unuttered message of me too you have probably experience this it be nothing you can put your finger on but the air suddenly fill with a high charge of electricity why she marry him i do not know i myself be fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him be a mystery to me he already have that slow pace that come over the elderly while she herself have all the sign of one who appreciate the joy of live perhaps with my uncle she find a measure of economic security that she need or maybe she like men old enough to be her father some woman with father fixation do for several week we eye one another almost like spar partner and then one day uncle be slightly indispose and stay home his bride open the store i be wait in front of it when she show up and tell me of my uncle s indisposition even a she be tell me about it i become aware of a give away flush that suffuse her neck and move upwards to her cheek and subconsciously i realize that when she enter the store she do not switch on the light the cavernous depth clutter with antique echo to her hard heel a she walk directly to the office in the rear and take the seat at his desk she place her palm finger outspread on the desk in an odd gesture a if to say now what next i be aware of a humid look in her eye that tell me the time be opportune there be little likelihood of any customer walk in at that hour i be stand beside her watch the outspread palm and wonder about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes nap i bend and kiss the still pink neck and suddenly she jump up and her two arm encircle me in a bear like crush her mouth which have be so much in my thought be warm and moist and tender i hear her murmur we d well lock the door it do not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and it couch when we open the door again for business and switch on the light she say he will not always be indispose i know i be think about that how will we work it out i don t know she say you re the man you figure it out i ve notice the way you ve be look at me ever since we meet i guess we both felt it i say i guess so she say but now what even a i say it i realize that an education can be invaluable i know what we can do i say tell him i make a pass at you she raise a protest hand with a startle air what be you try to do get throw out if i even hint at it do you think it will matter that you be his nephew and not even a blood nephew i don t want to be throw out and i don t think i will i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspect u by tell him you be make

prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead you be both the same size he could use your clothe for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask when i show up he will know you be a good wife to have tell him about it but you she begin don t worry about me it will turn out all right i don t understand she insist be you try to cut your throat no i chuckle i m just begin to collect dividend on my investment in education a we expect on the follow day my uncle be completely recover and open the store a usual at in the morning i felt that he look at me coldly and

if this day be no different from other day i hear subsequently that my uncle and aunt have dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he go home to get into his costume to keep the date shortly before nine i drive my jalopy to the street face the lake and park the car in shadow far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view a few minute late i saw my uncle s car drive up and a woman s figure emerge and walk to the corner i must say the figure be well make up if it be not that i know who it be i could have mistake it for my aunt so well do her clothe fit him in one hand he grip firmly a parasol though there have be no indication of rain i suspect why he bring it along in the half darkness i approach cautiously make sure he do not see me he be look out on the dark water of the lake when i come upon him and without waste word i smack him hard across the face you cheap bitch i exclaim you cheap no good two time bitch you get a good loyal husband smack and you fall for a pass by his own nephew you should smack be ashamed of yourself

starve but at least i wouldn t be fry to a crisp and soak with dirt he darken under his heavy burn his blue eye seek the shimmer sea of haze ahead to his puzzlement there suddenly be no haze the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp limbed line of gaunt scour hill that form the horizon twenty mile ahead then he notice the cloud race upon them heavy ominous leaden cloud that form even a they slice over the crest of the surround hill he have never see cloud like them before but he have the primitive feel of danger that grip a man before a hurricane in carolina he holler hoarsely hang on and goad the ox a he yell he want to turn them put the wagon against the storm too late he realize that in turn he have wheel them onto a patch of sandy grind instead of atop a grade or ridge he swing up over the wheel you have well get inside he warn her but she sit on in stubborn silence the cloud bulge downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel freeze they star at it whirl down the valley gouge and spit out boulder and chunk of earth like a starve hound dog crack marrowbone the six ton conestoga begin to whip and shake their world turn black it be fill with dust and wind and sound and violence the heaven open pelt them with hail the size of walnut and then come the water not rain but solid sheet that sluice down like water slop from a bucket wall of water rush down the slop and fill the hollow like the crest of flash flood through the splash of the rise water they could hear the roar of the river a it rag through it canyon gnash big chunk out of the bank the jet froth surface of the river reach the level of the runoff the dangerous current upon the prairie cease but the water stand and keep on rise they cringe under sodden cover listen to the wave slop against the bottom the cloudburst cut off abruptly they be engulf by the weird silence break only by the low angry murmur of the river then the darkness thin and there be light again and then bright sunlight beat with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawl to the hurricane deck and look out haggardly at a world of water that reach clear to the surround hill the water level be high than their hub only the heavy bone of the ox keep them anchor there be no real sign of the river now just a roil oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy water that reach everywhere clump of brush ride down the ribbon now and then the glisten side of a half swamp object show a it sweep past the girl crawl out into the renew warmth of the sunshine hug her shoulder and still trembling her face be pale but set and her dark eye smolder with blame for ben out of compulsion to say something cheery ben prime blurt well we be lucky to be on soft grind when the first floodhead hit at least the wheel dig in the soak will put life back in the wagon too his wife didn t give a sign she d hear she be watch a tree ride wildly down that roil current somebody be rid the tree it race close and they could see a woman with white hair sit astride an upright branch she do not call out but a the tree pass she lift an arm in gesture of well luck and farewell they watch the tree until it twist sharply on a bend it spear up into the air then sink back the up jutting branch turn slowly the pale blob of the woman disappear there s the one who s lucky the girl murmur harshly ben s eye strain with the bitter hurt his homely face slash with gray and crimson then he take off his wet boot and drop down into the water to talk with the beast need their comfort more than they need his it be nearly sundown and he go to the back of the wagon half swim his way for he be not a tall man he let down the tailgate and be knock over by the sluice of water he sputter back to his foot and scramble madly to pull his bag of seed grain forward they be already swell to burst of all their worldly belong next to the ox and his gun the seed grain have be the most treasure it be spoil now for seed and it would sour and mold in three day if they fail to find a place and fuel to dry it the ox might a well enjoy it he examine the water mark on the iron tire when the animal be finish the water lay muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheel there be not a match width of damp mark to show they be recede he doubt if a man could wade a far a the desolate dry hill that rim the valley a terrible numb sense of futility sweep over him he grip the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat then he notice that the dry wood of the wheel have swell the spoke be tight again the iron tire grip onto the wheel a if of one piece hope surge within him he swing toward the front to give the news to hettie then stop bar from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate still he felt well a tight wagon mean so much he get a small fire start and put on bacon and coffee he pour the water off the sourdough and off the flour salvage the chunky watery mess for biscuit of a sort their jam and jelly have not suffer he find a jar of preserve tomato and one of egg that they have mean to save now he break them open hop a good meal might lessen this depression crush hettie his long nose wiggle at the smell of frizzle bacon and heat java but the fire be low and he want to waste no time he furl the slash side of the canvas tarpaulin leave the rib and wagon open he look thoughtfully at his wife s trunk hold her meager treasure he say hesitantly hettie i don t figure your thing get wet too much that s a good trunk if you want to get them air she say without turn her head after that

cn21,cn21,imaginative,adventure,2341,sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dream of i suppose a lascar sailor have sneak a cigarette in the hold and touch off the blaze now roar up in great oily cloud of smoke and flame the fierce heat quickly drive u to the stern where we huddle like suffocate sheep not know what to do the lifeboat be stick fast we couldn t budge them i hear a cry from a stoker a a pillar of flame leap from a hatch and tongue the man s bare back he sprint to the rail and leap overboard into the shark infest water one especially bad detonation shake lifeboat no which tremble violently in the davit brassnose yell come on sommers max step on it we get a chance now heave on those rope the boat s come unstuck we pull and swear and yank and weep scrap our hand until they bleed profusely the bonaventure be quiver and lurch like an old spavined mare her stern be down and a sharp list help u to cut loose the lifeboat which drop heavily into the water brassnose max and i leap into the sea and swim to the boat let s get away fast say brassnose shake water from his mop of bleach hair that tub be go to explode all at once then the bonaventure seem to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geyser of spark and flame and a dense cloud of black and orange smoke dimly we hear the voice of men in mortal agony but we couldn t go back into that inferno already our leaky lifeboat be fill with five inch of water sommers you bale while we row brassnose command a best a i could determine we be some mile west of new guinea in the bismark archipelago three day previously we have steam past barren rennell island in the distance now we peer anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific for this interminable bail would have to stop soon there be gigantic blister and rope burn on our hand our muscle be hot wire of pain brassnose be strangely silent the big man with the whiten hair murmur something his word sound a if they be in the manu tongue which i recognize have study the dialect in my anthropology class at the university of chicago he then say something which strike a chord in my memory god help u if we re near the island of eromonga we d be in real trouble then i d rather keep bail or sink i be puzzle by the remark then i recall the voice of mild professor howard griggs three year ago in a university lecture on primitive society he have be speak of this archipelago even when the island be under german mandate before world war european give eromonga a wide berth the place be inhabit by several hundred warlike woman who be anachronism of the twentieth century stone age amazon who live in an all female matriarchal society which be self sufficient i remember too the jest voice of a classmate bobby pauson but how do they reproduce dr griggs i m sure that male have something to do with that process there have be classroom guffaw which quickly subside a professor griggs say dryly i see your point pauson of course male play a role there but believe me when i say you wouldn t enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga indeed you wouldn t live long for the female either drive the men they ve seize from neighbor island back to their boat after exploit them for amatory purpose or they destroy them by revolt but ingenious method in fact one important aspect of their very religion be the annihilation of men i think i know what you mean brassnose i say i know something about eromonga let s hope we come to a safe place but we didn t three hour late while we be bail desperately a dot of land come into view foster lukuklu frayne make a sign over his heart with his two link thumb i recognize it a an ancient manu gesture intend to propitiate the devil a half hour pass we have drift close in a voice so frighten a to seem not his own the big bo sun s mate quaver tchalo it be eromonga look hard you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff i squint at the loom shoreline there be a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump it be perhaps foot high and have be artfully construct of log a fine example of engineering in a primitive society what be the scaffolding for brassnose he make a sound of despair deep in his throat it be embarrass to see strap blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talk about bogeyman aaa ee it be their tultul the jump platform of death it be the last of the three test of manhood which the woman impose to discover if a male be worthy of survival there often i hear my uncle and cousin speak of it when i be a small boy grow up in rabaul they have never see a tultul but they have hear about it from their father our lifeboat be fill rapidly and despite what i have hear of the inhabitant of eromonga i be glad to see a long and graceful outrigger man by three bronze girl glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft i expect brassnose a a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood to speak to them but he have turn a sickly green and appear tongue tie or panic so i muster my few word of the manu dialect and say we greet you in peace in ngandlu my friend and i come from a ship which be destroy by fire we be thirsty and hungry our sore and burn hand and arm need attention the girl in the prow of the outrigger turn a smile like a beacon on me i note that her full breast be bare and that she wear a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue black hair she say my name be songau and these girl be ponkob and piwen you be welcome to eromonga my people await you on the shore you shall have food water and rest thirty minute late the outrigger grate on sand and other girl wait on shore rush forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine rope to a large boulder i saw a dozen or so other outrigger moor there i look all my rosy vision of rest and even pleasure on this island vanish at the sight there be a mound of bleach human bone and skull at the base of the big wooden derrick some have be there for year others still have whiten shred of decay flesh stick to them there be one object which sicken yet fascinate me this be also a corpse a male judge from the coral arm band the tribal scar still discernible on the maggoty face the paint bone of the warrior caste which still pierce the septum of the rot nose the body may have be two or three week dead i look with revulsion at the leg they be shatter many small bone protrude crazily from the shred of flesh the man must have leap to his death from the topmost ring of the tultul a if divine my thought the girl songau smile warmly and say in the casual tone an american woman might use in describe her rise garden this be our tultul a jump platform aku late you shall know it well be it not well make our old one blow down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moon ago it take thirty of our woman almost six moon to build this one which be high and strong than the old one we be very proud of it you have every right to be i reply gravely in the manu dialect but my attention be fix on brassnose the big and strong of u he look a if he be go to keel over i felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn t do to show these girl that we be afraid not so soon anyway i clap the big man with the bleach hair on his shoulder and say heartily hop it would make an impression on the woman this one be the maku frayne he speak your language too for he be the grandson of a chieftain on taui who make much magic and be strong and cunning the maku frayne have inherit this strength from his grandfather this be the worst thing i could have say brassnose turn a stricken face toward me and say brokenly sommers you meddling yank you re a fool they despise male who brag of their strength they destroy such men with their damned test you ve ruin me blast you at first i think he be out of his head talk wildly like this but a glance at songau and the other woman confirm what brassnose have blurt out the woman s face have harden after my statement at a nod from songau four lithe and muscular girl dart to frayne s side and seize him by the arm the man be an ox and he put up a creditable struggle but four eromonga woman be more than a match for the strong male that ever live besides terror have sap some of frayne s vitality and will my last impression a they lead him off to a stockade be of his pale face in the manu tongue eromonga mean manhood a quality which the woman derisively toast in weekly feast at which great quantity of a brew like kava be imbibe in the hut to which i be assign max have his own quarter my food be bring to me by a wrinkle crone with bare droop breast who seem to enjoy converse with me in rudimentary phrase her name be l turu and she tell me many thing for an anthropologist loquacious old l turu be a mine of information though i have a great dread of the island and felt i would never leave it alive i eagerly write down everything she tell me about it woman her account be late confirm by the scobee frazier expedition from the university of manitoba in from l turu i hear that until about the people of this island which be about the size of guam or small have be of both sex and that the normal family life of melanesian tribe be observe here with minor variation but in the middle of the last century an island woman name karipo seize a spear in the heat of an inter tribal battle and rally the woman after their men have flee miraculously karipo and her woman have succeed in drive a hundred invader from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoe after considerable loss of life on both side karipo be something of a politician a well a a militarist she quickly exploit the exalt position she now occupy by harass the disorganize male and even put many of them to death within a decade or less few men be leave and a feminist society have spring up karipo be great goddess tell our mother that men be not necessary except to father child the crone tell me all men go away from here those who stay have to pass test few pass she cackle with mirth show the stump of betel stain teeth karipo s woman then name this place eromonga manhood for just the strong men could stay here come i show you the old woman arise stiffly and lead me to a clear where a small hut stand in the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwell i saw four figure in a semi circle on the grind

their identity when they follow truck to check their speed sometimes they just park at the side of the road and use radar on the truck a they pass all the driver know about the plate and they also know about the big floppy straw hat with shred edge the kind native in travel ad wear when they be out joyfully chop cane horsely an agent on the east end wear the hat try to look like a tourist it

see her again the feel subside it be only a small yearn their work be lonely what s she do in this bunch benson say and ramey wonder how close their thought might have be the girl look around at the countryside her glance swing past the trailer where the two driver be stand it make only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then move on she begin to watch a blonde haired man also in short stand right at the rear of the wreck car in the one spot that most of the crowd have detour slightly what have catch his attention be obscure by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck driver could see but benson know what it be the girl take a couple of step toward the man in short when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could never decide be real say you

almost under the car the two driver move close what do he want a spoon benson say to ramey one tiny detail in a happen can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain with ramey it be a dusty work shoe that be half off the indian s foot that he would always remember the lace be break at the bottom of the eyelet but there be still a bow knot at the top the slight twitch would have part the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toe be still inside the two men in overall stand just behind the blonde head man he wear tennis short and a white sweater with a red v at the neck the sleeve push above the elbow he turn and look at them with clear blue eye immaculate eye he be very tan big hand might have tear him from a coca cola poster he s dead isn t he the man say he turn and bend over the body of the indian there be nothing in particular on the man s face it be simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine what s this the man say back up a step still look down his word be mostly to himself don t there be a gentle concern in benson s voice ramey look down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man s tan leg cautiously nudge a bit of fold blood fleck substance lie by itself on the pavement but what be it the man say with a tone of impatience but what be it the man have speak only once ramey hear the word again inside weaken the way move water sound through a grove of tree until he be not sure whether it be sound or light headedness press in his ear the sneaker reach out once more to tap against the mass and ramey s vision darken except for an unreasonable clarity of the man s leg ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hair on the brown skin he star at the shin shin circle of hair and hear the voice of his partner through tree don t do that fella them s brain the man seem to sink a little a ramey bring the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seem that the blonde head be turn a he hit the man again with his fist ramey swing and catch the man just to the leave of his mouth it be a straight solid once in a lifetime shoot he lay all four knuckle in between the man s cheekbone and his chin ramey s fist and the air expel from the man s collapse cheek make a hollow pop in the air like cup hand clap together the man take two short step backward then sit down heavily on the pavement ramey hear a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand a he watch the man sit suddenly a detach part of his mind observe how very difficult it be really to knock a man off his foot he hadn t do it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard with a thoughtful look the man sit on the pavement leg straight out in front of him his arm hang like empty shirt sleeve and his mouth be slightly open after what seem several second the open mouth grow dark inside then blood begin to ooze from it the man bring one hand up slowly and the finger fumble across his face until he touch his mouth he moan and pull the hand away even yet there be no realization in his eye ramey could hear the crowd come up rapidly behind him and the question voice come over his shoulder have no identity or importance to him he do not look around what happen someone say he s hurt a woman s voice say and then he hear a sort of wail from the man s wife the man on the grind begin to move one of his hand flatten out on the pavement and support him blood drip down the front of his sweater soak into a dark streak of dirt that run diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder a though the bright v weave into the neckline have melt run a dark color the girl kneel by her husband with one arm at his back can you hear can you talk to me she beg an incoherent puzzle sound come from the red mouth the girl look around quickly at several of the people none of the crowd have step forward to help then she saw ramey and her face be misshapen with bewilderment why do you do it why do you hit him she say her voice rise ramey say nothing a shine in her eye suddenly become tear and she turn back to her husband again behind ramey foot scrap beneath sharp question

of the ruddiness be go from his face and he star at ramey it s all over now the driver think a he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them ramey watch him come with a vision a clean a the glare on the metal side of the trailer he saw the dark sweat spot flip in and out of sight under the patrolman s swing arm and in the leather holster that swagger and roll at the side of his stocky body the sun leave a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that run between the horn handle of his pistol all right step back the patrolman say to no one in particular a he push between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levi he walk straight up to the man sit on the grind and bend over to look at him you all right mough it s my mough the man say try to

he usually invite them a he do now no what i get margaret rider in one of them old box car down there by the quarry a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flash across jack s mind his heart beat fast hell you say he say lapse into the profanity he often use when away from his parent and especially when he be with charles how d you do it hell i jist get on top of no i mean how d you get her to do it hell i jist ask her jist like that hell yes she s be hangin around me a lot here lately and i figgered i might a well s try it besides i hear her old uncle that stay there have be doin it i never hear that it s all over branchville if you d get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself i might try it one of these day jack say wonderingly think of miss langford when they reach the school a gang of boy and girl be already there play crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse miss langford in a fresh white dress and low heel white sandal without sock be out there with them try to get them inside time for book she yell jingle a little five and dime store bell in her right hand let s go inside oh come on miss langford play with u just onct one of the little girl beg smile wistfully no not now say the teacher maybe at dinner time come inside now the child grudgingly stop play then and straggle into the schoolhouse jack watch miss langford all morning he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles have say that morning about margaret rider occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sit in the sixth grade row and he could hardly believe she would do what charles have say she do at noontime remember what the teacher have say about maybe play with the kid jack stay close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boy except charles go off out the road to play ball why ain t you playin ball he ask charles suspiciously a they sit in the well house shade watch the girl congregate in front of the schoolhouse miss langford come out and play with u like you promise several of the little girl call i d druther stay here and watch

the little girl jump up and down yell goody goody let s play with em jack say rise from where he sit on the grind and dust off his overall pant o k charles rise also and the two of them move over to join the girl they play crack the whip a few minute without mishap then when miss langford be on the end of the line of girl jack in the middle of the line give an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawl backwards sit down hard her dress fly over her head while she be struggle to get her skirt down and get on her foot again jack run over offer her his hand and say gosh i m sorry miss

more neither me neither others say and soon the game break up the child go off in pair in large group and alone jack walk off alone out the road in the sear midday sun past robert allen s three room tarpapered house toward the field where the other boy be play ball think of what he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after school because this be the day he have decide when he think he saw the look in her eye when he come back to the schoolhouse his mind be make up he simply would not work his arithmetic problem when the teacher hold his class that should do it he think because miss langford have say she be go to be strict about school work he have consider throw eraser or flip paperwads at someone or pull the hair of the girl sit in front of him but he couldn t take a chance on either of these possibility the teacher probably would make him stand face to wall in a corner instead of stay in after school the only drawback now to the plan he d decide on be that someone else might fail to do his work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack but i ve get to take a chance on it he tell himself desperately to his surprise his plan work perfectly all right if you can t do your arithmetic during school hour you can do it after school be out miss langford say firmly not smile you will stay here thirty minute after the others go home this afternoon and work your problem and so when the others stampede out that afternoon jack remain docilely in his seat near a window look out in what he hop be a pitiable manner while the other kid laugh and yell in at him and make face a they disperse go home he scarcely saw them his heart be pound like a mighty dynamo and he be try to think his mind seem to scream at him like a hurt or frighten child how will i do it

against the screen door in early june or the smell of thick tomato paste the ripe smell that be both sweet and sour rise up from aluminum tray wrap in fly dot cheesecloth or the surge whirl sound of bat at night when their black body dive into the blackness above and below the amber street light or the bay of female dog in heat they never call him by name although he have one filippo rossi that s what he be call in the old country but here he be just signore or the old man but this be not unusual because youth in these quarter be always push at a distance from it elder youth obey when command it go to church on sunday and one saturday a month go to confession but youth ask nothing of it parent not a touch of the hand or a kiss give in pass the only thing unusual about the old man have long since happen but the past be dead here a the present be dead once the old man have have a wife and once she too ignore him with a tiny fur piece wrap around her shoulder she wiggle her satin cover buttock down the street before him and didn t stop in one hand she clutch a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase the way she strut down the street the old man would have be blind not to have notice both without look at him without look at anything except drexel street directly in front of her she climb up into one of those orange streetcar ride away in it and never come back but she shouldn t have come here in the first place the woman have say no no not that one she think she be big than we be because she come from torino eh torino she give herself fancy air just because she

anything sweet than the taste of new wine and the passion of man s tongue have not smile but have condemn again and again puttana but if the old man even think about his wife now nobody care a fig it be enough for people to know that at one time he have look down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he have consume watch her become thin and thin in the distance a thin a the seam on her stock and still thin his voice have not command her to stop it have not question why the woman say they have see him wave an exhaust farewell but he might have be shoo away the flea that hop from his yellow dog onto him he be never without that dog and his eye those miniature sundial of variegate yellow have not alter their expression or direction the old man s very soul could have leave him and fly down that street but he wouldn t have have anyone know it perhaps he have know then where that hundred dollar bill have come from and where it be take his wife but when he call for his wither wrinkle sister rise to care for him and the child have he guess that all he would remember of his woman be the memory of her climb into that streetcar there seem to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sit there with his eye glue to drexel street and his back in opposition to the church behind him for all he saw or care to see this could have be a town in italy not the outskirt of philadelphia it could have be bari or chieti for the way it smell what do it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretch beneath elevate train that roar from the stucco station into the city s center at half hour interval or that the tiny creek spin it silent course toward the schuylkill this place be hatred to him just a hatred be his only companion in his aloneness to him they be one and the same sameness for the old man be frame in by a wall of ginkgo tree which divide these quarter from the city sameness line the street with two story house the color of ash it slash the slop manure scent lawn with concrete step which climb upward to white wooden porch it sway with the wicker swing and screech with the rust hinge of screen door even the stable garage which house nothing now but the scent of rot have a lawn before it and the coffee shop on drexel street where the men spend their evening and sunday play card have a rise hedge beneath it window the hedge reek of coffee dreg throw against it only one house on the street have no lawn before it it squat low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grate support a glass facade that be bartoli s shop above it from a second story showroom wooden angel survey the neighborhood do the old man remember them there yet everywhere else sameness be stucco and wood in square block like fortress perch against the slant of the hill rise with the hill to the top where the church be and beyond that to the cemetery only pave alleyway tunnel through the wall of those fortress into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the house where backyard own no fence where one man s property blend with the next to form courtyard in which no one know privacy love and hatred and fear be one here shade only by fig tree and grape vine and the fork tongue of gossip lick it sinister way from back porch to back porch the old man silently feed upon these street they keep him alive wait wait for what and for whom only he could tell and would not it be a though he have make a pact with the devil himself but it be not yet time to pay the price he be hold out for something he be determine to hold out the old man s son throw himself down belly first upon a concrete step take in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich at fifteen he didn t care that he have no mother that he couldn t remember her face or her touch neither do he care that aunt rise provide for him he be name pompeii a a tribute to his heritage and he couldn t have care less about that either to him life be a restless boredom that begin with the rise sun and end only with sleep when he would be a man he would be a rich man he would not be like the rich american who live in white columned house on the other side of the park he would not ride the eight thirty local to the city each morning he would not carry a brief case nor would he work at all he would square his shoulder and carry a cane before each step he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come run bow with her run call out in her bow at your service he would order her to bring coffee and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff he would not remove his glove and light and smoke he could do that when he would be a man hey laura he call to his sister on the porch above the step she be only ten month old than he laura what would you say if i smoke a pipe laura do not answer him she lean unconcerned against the break porch fence brush and dry her wet gild hair in the sun one lithe leg straddle the rail and swing loosely before the creaking tear pal her tan foot whose arch sweep high and white point artfully toward taper toe toe like finger whose tip glow white all the while she sit there her sinewy arm swirl before her chest her face show no sign of have hear pompeii it be a face that have lose it childlike softness and be begin to fold within it fragile feature a harshness that belie the lyric line of it contour the eye blue and always somewhat downcast possess a sullen quality even though the boy could not see them he know they be cloud by distance he be never sure they fully take him in pompeii call again laura but the only answer that reach him be the screeching of the porch rail from her leg move against it she s in a mood he think there s not a month she doesn t get herself in a mood well what do that matter when the sun be shin and there be dream to dream about and a for his pipe if he want to smoke one nobody would stop him not even laura suddenly he be interrupt in his daydream by a warm wetness lap against his chin and his eye open wide and long at the sight of a goat s claret tongue feast against the salt taste of him above the tongue an age yellow eye sallow and time cast encrust within a sphere of marbleize pink skin star unfalteringly at him christ sake goat git but the goat would not you re boil milk ain t you soothe it with his hand know the whisker jowl and the swell smoothness of teat that wrinkle expectantly to his touch pompeii roll over his head undulate gradually cover space to come strain beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teat with his mouth open wide he squirt the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savor the light earthy taste of it the boy s finger and mouth operate with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player press and pull delight in what he do above him slide the evasive shadow of a storm cloud it form be a heavy figure in a flutter soutane but the boy could see only the goat s belly the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him sense something portentous in it he know it be there know also what it be about but he wouldn t raise a

somers those name in the greek paper be manufacture reason to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty so a to be near spencer watch an opportunity to communicate with him hostile glance be flash at both alexander and gansevoort the two meet in the captain s cabin what be the next step captain more arrest i fear in your opinion who be this e andrew on the certain list cromwell of course he be the old and most experience of the lot he saw the danger not the glory of be identify a a mutineer somehow he talk spencer into let him use another name there be a tap at the door and oliver enter with the word that heiser wish to see the captain have him come in heiser breathless and wild eye bring the chill news that the handspike heaver and holystone have be mysteriously remove from their customary place and also sir two article which be consider souvenir now must be regard in another light entirely an african knife and battle ax be at this moment be sharpen by mckinley and green mckinley be overhear to say that he would like to get the knife into spencer s possession and that where do you gather all this information heiser who report to you the disappearance of handspike and heaver and who he be interrupt by a crash from the deck and spring toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him a glance reveal that the main topgallant mast have be carry away the aimless mill about of what have be a well train well organize crew strike alexander with horror he bellow order and watch the alert response of some of his men and watch too the way a dozen or more turn their head questioningly toward the shackle figure a though for far instruction adrien deslonde hasten to alexander s side small violently jerk the weather royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast i saw him myself and it be do after consultation with cromwell i swear it sir and it be clear that adrien be not mistake for both small and cromwell take no step toward aid in the send up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer have give the signal to obey then with disappointment evident upon their face they move to the work alexander guess that they have plan confusion and turmoil think it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed their strategy be sound enough and he reason have be defeat only by philip spencer s unwillingness to sanction an idea he have not originate when the mast be raise alexander give the order for small and cromwell to be place under arrest and now three figure in iron sprawl upon the open deck and terror stalk the somers spencer s potential follower be openly sullen and morose miss muster without excuse express in ominous tone their displeasure at the prisoner be keep in iron communicate with the three by glance and signal one of the miss handspike come out of it hide place after midshipman tillotson have be insolently disobey by seaman wilson tillotson have report the man to gansevoort and an hour late with back turn have be attack by wilson brandish the weapon wilson shackle and snarl be throw with the other prisoner and be soon join by green mckee and mckinley not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involve in the crime of mutiny in the tiny cabin alexander meet with gansevoort heiser and wale to speak and to listen three day have pass since spencer s arrest and each day have bring new danger new fear gansevoort say it require an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely to have the greek paper be not the great help that at first flush it seem from action aboard it be easy to guess that spencer s boast of twenty staunch follower be a modest estimate well heiser venture why don t we hold an investigation with question and that would be bad than useless alexander break in there be not space to hold or force to guard any increase number of prisoner besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what then we have inform a large number of our crew that when they reach the unite state they will be punish but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and be expect to perform their job in good order mr heiser do this sound like a truly workable plan to you do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now wale say of course they would they be about to do so at any moment a it be all that be need be for one man to feel self confident enough to take the lead a soon a that one man be appoint by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer we be go to be rush we be go to be rush and murder that be extravagant language mr wale we be not go to be rush and murder alexander say we be go to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound of course i agree with the captain gansevoort say thoughtfully but the conspiracy be ferocious and desperate the instinct of discipline have be lose anything be possible when anarchy have the upper hand he pause then add everything on a ship be a weapon implement of wood and iron be available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stand and we be positive of so few and suspicious of so many we ourselves must stand sentinel alexander say under arm day and night watch and watch about those of u present the perry brother deslonde and the other midshipman now have the responsibility of the somers a great deal of labor we have a well for we be too uncertain of where trust may be place and when he be alone again in the cabin alexander lower his head into his arm and weep for he know full well what must be do what in the end would be do with all his heart he have love the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy s implacable law and when he do when he give to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor he know he would lose forever the navy to which he have dedicate his soul where have he fail how have he fail he who have try so hard who have yearn so passionately to be a great officer it come to him a he weep there aboard the somers that it be a foolish to strive for greatness a to seek to storm the gate of heaven it be give or it be not give one do one s best and if fortune smile there be a reward one do one s best and if fortune frown an eighteen year old boy with murder in his heart sail aboard one s ship and alexander sob like a girl for the dream he have have and he felt no shame god know his tear be his to shed if he so desire for it have not be with an egotist s rage for fame that he have hold precious his naval career another field have give him fame enough to satisfy any egotist it be for love that he have serve the navy to have someday that love return be what he have live for now the hope be go yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price dear god at what a price and after a while he dry his tear and walk the deck a a captain should with assurance and dignity stern face he inspect the prisoner satisfy himself that they be clean well feed and comfortable within reason the prisoner avert their eye but not before he have glimpse hatred and anger only cromwell the giant boatswain be mild mannered and respectful he say captain may i speak please captain i be innocent of any plot against you or the ship be you cromwell yes sir before god i swear i be innocent i know nothing of any plot if there be such a thing you be the only man aboard who can be in doubt i can not speak for others sir but i be innocent he lean close to alexander squint up at him from the deck surely captain you do not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything no cromwell i do not find your name you be careful about that now spencer seem with effort to shake himself from lethargy speak he say cromwell be tell you the truth he be innocent alexander shift his gaze to spencer the calmness and detachment of his tone suggest unawareness of how implicit be his own guilt in the word he have use to defend cromwell alexander know spencer too well to think him naive or thick skulled and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognize a kinship with spencer here be another human who understand the stupidity of quarrel with the inevitable there be good fortune and there be bad and philip spencer in handcuff and ankle iron know it to be a truth he expect nothing for himself but that which naturally follow those mark for misfortune the red haired captain tower above the prisoner a a symbol of decency and authority be shock to find himself look with sympathy upon philip spencer this tragic lad have forge his own shackle but he could not have do so could not have find the way have fortune favor him and because fortune have favor neither the prisoner nor the red haired captain they would be each other s undo spencer if there be guilt if you do not deny your own how be it possible for cromwell to be innocent he be your constant companion the hazel eye meet alexander s i tell you he be innocent and do you think there be a reason why i should accept your word yes i have nothing to gain by defend cromwell nothing to lose either spencer that s true spencer agree and withdraw himself from the conversation his eye go back to contemplation of the sea i be innocent captain cromwell say again before god captain i be innocent and though it be logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still it be difficult to understand why spencer speak only for cromwell the boatswain be a guilty a any no action of his could be interpret in his favor and four midshipman prior to their know the significance of the greek paper have see it in cromwell s hand while spencer whisper explanation i think midshipman rogers have tell alexander that spencer be teaching him geometry it be fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackle to the wardroom where a class of apprentice await him this be a train ship and the train would continue but there be an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognize some of these apprentice be in physical strength already men and doubtless a percentage of them be spencer s follower

century armor furnishing clothe i even ferret out the material from which shield be make linden wood cover with leather so i d get the light reflection accurate mckenzie the art editor take one look at my finish sketch and say nothing do rufus in the first place it s static in the second place it doesn t look authentic and in the third place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place you ve get six color there include gold i say mr mckenzie it be a authentic a careful research can make it he say that may be but it isn t authentic the way reader think they know from their research into television and the movie that knight in the middle age have beautiful flow haircut like little lord fauntleroy and only the villain have beard and girl couldn t have dress like that it isn t transparent enough in the end i do the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy give him a sword instead of a pistol and paint in furniture from the still of a costume movie mckenzie be a happy a a clam that s authenticity he say a for donald he actually sell painting we all paint in our spare time and we have all start a easel painter with scholarship but he be the only one of u who make any regular money at it not much he sell perhaps three or four a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friend he have style a real inner vision of his very own it be strange stuff it remind me of the picture of a child but a child who have never play with other kid and have live all it life with adult there be the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of self consciousness but with a twist that make the form leap from the page and smack you in the eye we use to kid him by say he only paint that way because he be so nearsighted it may have be true for all i know because his glass be like the bottom of milk bottle but it didn t prevent the painting from be excite he also have at time an uncanny absent mind air like a sleepwalker he would look right through you while you be talk to him and if you say for christ s sake donald you ve get prussian blue all over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour late the paint would be all over his pant a well mr monmouth think of him a her discovery and she pay two to three hundred dollar for a painting it be all gravy and donald didn t need much to live on none of u do we share the expense of the studio and we all live within walk distance of it in cheap lodging of one kind or another attend the life class be my idea or rather askington s idea but i be ripe for it and the other two wouldn t have go if i hadn t talk them into it i want to paint again i hadn t do a serious picture in almost a year it wasn t just the pressure of work although that be the excuse i often use even to myself it be the kind of work i be do the quality of the ambition it awake in me that keep me from painting i keep say if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real money get to be well know a an illustrator like peter askington for instance then i could take some time off and paint askington be a kind of goal i set myself i have admire him long before i talk to him it look to me a though he have everything an artist could want joy in his work stand in the profession a large and steady income the night we first meet at one of mr monmouth s giant party he be wear a brown cashmere jacket with silver button and a soft pink viyella shirt instead of a necktie he wear a leather bolo draw through a golden ring in which be set a lump of pale pure jade this set his tone richness of texture and color and another kind of richness a well for his clothe and decoration would have pay the brush off s rent for a year he be fifteen year old than i forty four but full of spring and sparkle he didn t look like what i think of a an old man and his lively and erudite speech make him seem even young he be one of the most prominent magazine illustrator in america you saw one of his painting on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazine every month life have include him in it modern american artist series and have photograph him at his studio in the east sixty the corner of it you could see in the photograph look a though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty of spain i have a long talk with him we go into mr monmouth s library which have low bookshelf all along the wall and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve foot long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that look like an inscription from a martian tomb the fireplace have tile make for mr monmouth by picasso himself like certain expensive restaurant just sit there give you the illusion of be wealthy yourself in the course of our talk askington mention that he spend part of each week study by yourself i ask no i take class with different people he say i don t think i ve reach the point yet where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft besides it s important to the way a painter think that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the idea of other master a durer go to italy to meet bellini and mantegna he make a circle with his thumb and finger painting isn t this big you know it doesn t embrace only the artist alone before his easel it be a large a all of art interdependent vary multitudinous he throw his arm wide his face shin the artist be like a fragment of a mosaic no he be more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic one of these day i m go to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that s be paint these day from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then you ll be able to see at a glance how much artist have in common with each other the eye be all inward or outward ah what a title for the exhibition the eye be all what do you study i ask i be fascinate just listen to him make me feel intelligent i m study anatomy with burn he reply maybe you know him he teach at the manhattan school of art i nod i have study with burn ten year before during the scholarship year the manhattan give me along with the five hundred dollar prize for my painting of bum on hudson street burn and i have not love each other i m also study enamel with hajime iijima he go on and twice a week i go to a life class teach by pendleton osric pendleton i say my god be he still alive he must be a million year old i go to a retrospective of his work when i be eighteen and i think he be a contemporary of cezanne s not quite askington laugh he s about sixty now still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvas of mountain and farm he even make the city look like one of thoreau s hangout i ve always admire him and when i hear he be take a few pupil i go to him and join his class yes it sound great i say but suppose you don t think of yourself a an impressionist painter you re miss the point he say he have the magical eye and he be a great man contact with him be stimulate and that s the trouble with so many artist today they lack stimulation they sit alone in their room and try to paint and only succeed in isolate themselves still far from life that s one of the reason art be become a useless occupation in the middle age in the renaissance right up to the early nineteenth century the painter be a giant in the world he be an artisan a man who study his trade and develop his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver do he fill a real need show society what it look like turn it inside out portray it war and it leader it ugliness and it beauty reflect it profound religious impulse he be a propagandist they weren t afraid of the word then satirist nature lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party and of no party but look at u today we hold safe little job illustrate tooth paste ad or the salacious incident in trivial novel and most of our easel painting be nothing but pick the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplate in great purity a bunch of amateur dervish what we need be to get back to the group to learn and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school he could certainly talk the upshot of the evening be that i get the address of pendleton s studio or rather of the studio in which he give his class for he didn t work there himself and join the life class which meet every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning it be an awkward hour but i didn t have to punch any time clock and it only mean that sometimes i have to stay a couple of hour late at the draw board to finish up a job after a short time both george and donald join the class with me so they wouldn t feel lonely and we use to hang a sign on the door of the brush off read out to work it be mostly for the benefit of the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visit u in a way askington be right stimulate be the word for it i don t know that it be always a reward a i have expect it to be partly it be because pendleton himself wasn t what i anticipate i have come prepare to worship at the foot of this classic and he turn out to be a rather bitter old man who smell of dead cigar no that isn t quite fair actually there be a lot of force in him which be why i keep on in that class instead of quit after a week

heartless not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john cooper would hadn t linda be a perfect wife to bobbie who be the least bit of a disappointment all these year wasn t john cooper even more attractive at forty seven than he have be twenty five year early and wasn t john s wife edythe even more appal if possible didn t john cooper after all this time deserve something well of life wasn t it adult and realistic to look at it that way and romantic everybody know that john cooper have marry edythe on the rebound it be the kind of thing that could ruin a man s life and it be a tribute to john s strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn t ruin his of course there be nothing you could do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for let it happen mousie chandler say to linda stuart poor john linda accept the reproach which be something she do rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of when she be by all odds the prettiest and bright young woman west of the allegheny mountain and john be surely one of the handsomer and bright young men around pittsburgh for it have be john and linda ever since she have come out two season before at the golf club to the goggle eye admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow deb john have claim her from the stag line a young man a year out of dartmouth with

york who work for the same steel company a john do some people say linda have just announce the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john come home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe his bride it could no long be john and linda even to sentimental wishful thinker it wasn t even john and edythe it be simply poor john there be nothing specifically wrong with edythe but there be absolutely nothing right about her either mousie chandler have be to school with her someplace near baltimore and try to explain rather than defend her to the gang have lunch at

shallow bobbie and linda look magnificent at their wedding john be at the church with edythe she giggle during the ceremony and mousie chandler who be one of linda s bridesmaid say john glare black a death at her a if he be choke she say poor john edythe settle down to become a social myth and a horrible example her hair never seem to be in place and her skirt be never quite the correct length she didn t have a bad shape when you catch her at the pool at longue vue but her bath suit be far from smart and you didn t see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john have drift away from the gang mousie say it be because he be too proud to stand pity others think he couldn t stand see linda mr bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything there be less dramatic reason too john s mother die not long after his marriage and there be even less cooper money leave john sell the big old place in sewickley and buy a small house in fox chapel he be not reduce to poverty but his job at the steel company have become a real job and not a method of pass the day john be good at his job it probably wasn t hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe to come home to though that may be unfair since ben cooper john s first son come along early in the cut baby you ever saw and a blessing that he look all cooper from fontanel to pink toe nary a trace of edythe but the continue charm of the other child sally in and jack in and all john s success at his work only make edythe s dizziness and general uselessness more glare she never could fit into a crowd which have know which still know and admire linda when there be bridge at edythe s house the card shuffle like wet graham cracker and the food probably be wet graham cracker she manage a missionary drive for the church once and get the book so confuse that old mr webber the eldest elder who d never donate more than five dollar to anything have to cough up five hundred dollar to avoid a scandal in what edythe call the bosom of the church john do find the miss check and money afterward and the drive be actually oversubscribed which be a real bit of luck for the missionary be an intelligent man john must have guess what everyone think about edythe but he never let on by so much a a brave smile poor john be the kind of stock that keep a bargain without whimper and maybe bend over backward to keep a bad one he be an attentive and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they know that money must be a problem to him but he get ahead in business on leave from his job to an important washington assignment during the war after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company the cooper saw bobbie and linda socially but no more than be necessary

little more beautiful each year and then come the hairpin turn the smash jaguar and linda mourning alone and lovely everyone hold his or her breath don t think linda couldn t have get john back any time if she d try mousie gordon who have be mousie chandler say between bite of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le mont now you know she could ve but she isn t that kind of girl but now well it would be a blessing i think poor john linda evans felt more wretched than she have ever dream bobbie s death could move her to feel what she felt be a bone deep loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lose year that have be bring into high relief by his death she know what people be think it be what she have be think herself it be up to her to save poor john dear john to undo the wrong she have do but she tremble at the decision a at the brink of a cold stream there be no one who would blame her or john she could be sure of that it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her back to cleveland or anywhere and linda felt capable of capture the affection of the child anxious even since she and bobbie have have none of their own it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of linda would have to wait she know but what

factor in a large company which outsider and even some insider couldn t understand he didn t tell her of the long board meet where bobbie and john be weigh one against the other i m behind john cooper

tuxapoka to cousin elec s funeral he be full of heavy family reminiscence all the fine old stock be die out look at the world today his own child have suffer from the weaken of those value which he and theresa have always take for grant and a for his grandchild he have one so far still in diaper he shudder to think that the true mean of character might never dawn on them at all a life of

somehow go wrong theresa have see him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursue by various girl and various mamma of girl safely marry to the right sort however much in the early year of that match his wife anne have not seem to understand poor george could it just be theresa wonder that anne have understand only too well and that george all along be extraordinary only in the degree to which he be dull a for cousin alexander carraway the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him except his paper knife be that he have have exceptionally long hand and foot and one night about one o clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family have be arouse to go next door at cousin emma s call first papa then mother then theresa and george there they all do their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot he have hobble downstairs into the parlor in his agony and be sit wrap in his bathrobe on a footstool he hold his long clench foot in

cousin elec who be not at his best poor cousin elec george say he be young than theresa she remember look down and see his great round eye while at the same time she be dimly aware that her mother and father be not unamused poor cousin elec now here they both be still the same george full of round eye woe and cousin emma in despair theresa shift to a new page of course george s letter continue there be practical problem to be consider cousin emma be alone in that big old house and win t hear to part from it robbie and beryl try their best to persuade her to come and stay with them and anne and i have tell her she s more than welcome here but i think she feel that she might be an imposition especially a long a our rosie be still in high school the other possibility be to make arrangement for her to let out one or two of the room to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old lady that tuxapoka be populate with miss edna whittaker for example but there be more in this than meet the eye a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in the wallpaper in the back bedroom be literally crumble off theresa skip a page of detail about the house i hope if you have any idea along these line you will write me about them i may settle on some makeshift arrangement for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best i really shouldn t have smoke a cigarette so early in the day think theresa it always make me sick i ll start sneezing in a minute sit on these cold step she get up stand uncertainly for a moment then move aside to let go past her talk a group of young men they wear shoe with point toe odd to american eye and narrow trouser and their hair look unnaturally black and slick yet here they be obviously think to be handsome and felt themselves to be so just then a man approach her with a tray of cheap cameo parker fountain pen rosary papal portrait no say theresa no no she say the man do not wish to leave he know how to spread himself against the border of the space that have to separate them carrozza rid in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialize theresa turn away to escape and climb to a high land where the step divide in two there she walk to the far leave and lean on a vacant section of banister while the vendor pick himself another well dress american lady carry a camera and a handsome alligator bag ascend the step alone be he ever successful theresa wonder the lady with the alligator bag register interest doubt then indignation at last alarm she cast about a though look for a policeman this really shouldn t be allow finally she scurry away up the step theresa stubblefield still hold the family letter in one hand realize that her whole trip to europe be view in family circle a an interlude between cousin elec s death and do something about cousin emma they be even anne and george probably think themselves very considerate in not hint that she really should cut out one or two country and come home in august to get cousin emma s house ready before the teacher come to tuxapoka in september of course it wasn t anne and george s fault that one family crisis seem to follow another and weren t they always emphasize that they really didn t know what they would do without theresa the trouble be theresa think that while everything that happen there be suppose to matter supremely nothing here be suppose even to exist they would not care if all of europe be to sink into the ocean tomorrow it never register with them that i have time to read all of balzac dickens and stendhal while papa be die not to mention everything in the city library after mother s operation it would have be exactly the same to them if i have read through all twenty six volume of elsie dinsmore she arrange the letter carefully one on top of the other then with a motion so suddenly violent that she amaze herself she tear them in two signora she become aware that two italian workman carry a large azalea pot be stand before her and want her to move so that they could begin arrange a new row of the display mi diapiace signora ma insomma oh put it there she indicate a spot a little

cp22,cp22,imaginative,romance,2441,i know it a surely a everybody in westfield that lucille be a husband stealer you can t keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only plus and i ve be tell that just about every town no matter what it size have it lucille warren just a it have it susan dolan though nobody d ever bother to tell me that susan dolan that s me they even talk about lucille down at the young christian league where i spend a lot of time in bible class and help out with the office work for our foreign mission i never hear my folk talk about her though they be good live religious people and i can truthfully say i never hear them spread any gossip about anybody even if they ever do say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldn t have dream of say it in front of me my folk and my faith protect me from thing like that and so i be really upset the first time i discover that my boy friend johnnie be see mr warren i ask him about it one night while we be sit in his truck i ask him if it be true he give me a straight honest answer look sue baby he d say much a i love you well a guy s a guy and lucille s will to to come across honest kitten that s all it be i don t even like lucille much i guess it be at that moment that i realize what i be up against in the person of lucille warren but it didn t seem fair my love for johnnie be young and clean how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didn t hesitate to use her sex johnnie be a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty mile away and he be also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line it be a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first make his appearance in my back yard bring some stuff dad have order i wasn t in the habit of bat my eye at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i know he be different he wasn t only different he be it he have an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kid don t have but that i have sometimes admire in other old men his smile be quick and his eye hold some promise secret that make my knee go limp the most unbelievable thing about the chance meet be that he seem interest in me too i could hardly believe such good luck be mine and now lucille warren have get a look at him i guess she be between affair or something but anyway she have set her sight on johnnie my johnnie i didn t like it one bit but what could i do a man have to have his release at least that s what the boy use to say in high school and i wasn t provide it for johnnie neither be his wife she wouldn t have even if he d ask her but he wouldn t ask her he wasn t the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will and he wouldn t leave her either he d tell me that he be too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless child without their daddy johnnie love me and want me but the only love i be give him be the pure kind it be week before we even kiss for the first time against my folk wish we d be see each other for short rid in the truck the rid be tame enough mostly we talk but by the time the first crackle of spring come around we both know we be hopelessly in love yet even then we do nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little it s so crazy i tell him once i always imagine i would probably end up marry a minister or somebody like that somebody with no vice you know and you fall for a lumber jockey who drink far too much and smoke too much and i be tick off the item on my finger swear too much and go out with the boy whoever they be too much and who ever go to church and win t even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the fold he examine his nail carefully i could walk out the door don t you dare and never show my face or my truck around here again he still wasn t look at me you wouldn t or i could visit lucille warren you wouldn t please you wouldn t he shrug noncommittally i might and now he be see her he d just admit it to me i huddle miserably beside him in the truck it be all my do his see her johnnie and i have be innocent in our love and that be the way i want to keep it at first johnnie hadn t understand how could he not be a religious person like me but then he have say all right kid if that s how you want it that s how it ll be but what have i do try to keep u pure i have drive him into the arm of that scheme woman i have just the same a deliver him into the hand of the devil so one week late i surrender to him in the little motel on route my very first time i be desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he want or need and to keep him from the clutch of lucille warren and though at the time i blush to admit it even to myself there be in me a grow desire a sexual awareness that johnnie have set in motion an awareness that no other man have ever trigger i want him with a terrify fierceness astonishingly enough it be my own voice i hear there in the darkness beg this man to make love to me love me johnnie i will kitten outside in the summertime field behind the motel a thousand cricket serenade u will you always love me this way uh huh always mmm and i snuggle close to the man i love it be a blissful and fulfil a night a any bride ever experience i have have no wedding ceremony no witness no certificate of marriage but i have all the joy that go with them johnnie it can t be wrong can it not really johnnie rise on one elbow stop worry it s never wrong if love be real i take great comfort from his word and smile to myself in the darkness infinite peace complete contentment idiot s delight i late discover i felt no conflict between what i be do and my strict religious upbringing i have always resist the pass make at me by other kid and many time i have think about my love for johnnie who be thirty bring a maturity to love that the kid around town could know nothing about i have also think a lot about how god must look on true love and so in a way i be keep my promise to god my promise to remain pure until i be marry i be practically a bride after all there would have be a ceremony if it have be possible of this i have no doubt wouldn t johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness of course he would he d not only tell me so he d prove it it wasn t johnnie s fault that he be hopelessly tie down to that frightful woman who do her best to make his life unbearable just because he be honorable enough to want to continue support his two child a any decent man would that be no reason he should be deny his own small share of happiness too and if i could contribute to that i d do it the cost didn t matter no price be too high when true love be at stake and i have no doubt about how true this love be i d never even pet with a boy and after i meet johnnie he never touch me for the long while not until i all but throw myself at him he be plenty attentive all right but he behave like a gentleman and i figure that emotionally i be close to his age than to my own eighteen and a half what could a mere twelve year matter it wasn t i be sure a difference in age that come between people but a difference in maturity and hadn t i rescue him from lucille warren she d have get him if i hadn t stop her after all lucille warren be a husband stealer from way back but i d be a good girl and now god be blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we share it be only fit that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring love me uh huh love you always and always johnnie always mmm

that the boy my brother s son would soon come across the broad black area of plow grind carry the jar of cool water the boy usually be send out at about that time with the water and he always drag an old snow fence lath or a stick along to play with he pretend that the lath be a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzz tractor sound with his lip i almost run over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time i have turn at the corner of the field and i have to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth and i be think of the boy and the water anyway and when i look again down the furrow the snake be there it lay half in the furrow and half out and the front wheel have roll nearly up to it when i put in the clutch the tractor be heavily load with the weight of the plow turn the earth and the tractor stop instantly the snake slide slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow have make into the furrow and do not go any far i have never like snake much i still have that kind of quick panic that i d have a a child whenever i saw one but this snake be clean and bright and very beautiful he be multi color and graceful and he lay in the furrow and move his arch and taper head only so slightly go out of the furrow snake i say but it do not move at all i pull the throttle of the tractor in and out hop to frighten him with the noise but the snake only flick it black fork tongue and face the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern i let the engine idle then and i get down and go around the wheel and stand beside it my movement do frighten the snake and it raise it head and trail delicately a couple of foot and stop again and it tongue be work very rapidly i follow it look at the brilliant color on it tubular back the color clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamond the size of a baby s fist down it back and the diamond be set one within the other and interlace with glisten jet black the color be astonish clear and bright and it be a if the body hold a fire of it own and the color come through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm the eye be clear and black and the slender body be arch slightly his flat and gracefully taper head lift a i look at him and the black tongue slip in and out of that solemn mouth you beauty i say i couldn t kill you you be much too beautiful i have kill snake before when i be young but there have be no animal like this one and i know it be unthinkable that an animal such a that should die i pick him up and the length of him arch very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire color body like splendid ice and i know that he have eat only recently because there be two whole and solid little lump in the forepart of him like fieldmouse swallow whole might make the body caress through my hand like cool satin and my hand usually tan and dark be pale beside it and i ask it where the fire color could come from the coolness of that body i lower him so he would not fall and his body slide out onto the cool newly plow earth from between my pale hand the snake work away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carry his head a little above the roll clod the sharp burn color of his body stand brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target i felt good and satisfy look at the snake it shine in it bright diamond color against the sun burn stubble and the crumble black clod of soil and against the paleness of myself the color and beauty of it be strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field i get on the tractor again and i have to watch the plow closely because the field be draw across the long hillside and even in that good soil there be a danger of rock i have my back to the corner of the triangular field that point towards the house the earth be a little heavy and i have to stop once and clean the plowshare because they be not scour properly and i do not look back towards the place until i have turn the corner and be plow across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i have stop because of the snake i saw it all at a glance the boy be there at the lower corner of the field and he be in the plow earth stamp with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy i could see the hunch up shoulder the savage determination the dance of his foot a he grind the snake with his heel and the pirouette of his arm a he whip at it with the stick stop it i shout but the lumber and mighty tractor roar on above anything i could say i stop the tractor and i shout down to the boy and i know he could hear me for the morning be clear and still but he do not even hesitate in that brutal murder dance it be no use i felt myself tremble think of the diamond light of that beauty i have hold a few moment before and i want to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remember but i know it be already too late i drive the tractor on not look down there i be afraid to look for fear the evil might still be go on my head begin to ache and the fume of the tractor begin to bother my eye and i hat the job suddenly and i think there be only moment when one see beautiful thing and these be soon

his life lie awake at night he could see them lay out on the floor of his mind when he rise in the morning the image be still there he have always be a messy and negligent man in his bachelor day his bedroom have be strew with clothe which his mother or late the hotel maid generally saw fit to put in order no doubt dolores resent follow in their footstep but it be fun those first day kid about the trail of garment he leave litter across the rug there be an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up half slyly he enjoy see her stoop to lift the thing he remember the first time he saw her stand across the room at a party the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curl against it like petal her hair be the color of those bloom which in seed catalogue be refer to a black but since no flower be actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue he want to draw the broad patina of hair through his finger search it slowly for a trace of vein which might reveal it true shade beneath the darkness so he seek her out and speak to her and think of his hand in her hair or against her back press on the column of vertebra which hold her so magnificently straight and unyielding until the segment of bone make tiny sharp crack noise like the snap stem of a tulip but to put it bluntly nothing snap yet that have not seriously trouble him not then they marry more he could take at leisure all martin think he need be time to what well use could time be put he saw late that they have make their marriage too quickly there be too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delight of emotional clash and meet they have leave themselves too much to discover but at the start his new life felt invigorate good it be on the tenth day after the wedding how could it have be so soon that he drop the short on the floor now i m not go to pick up those short martin give her a tease pat i think you ll get tire of them there in the morning the short be where he have leave them he smile to himself and decide not to mention them till dolores do it be almost too easy for he have just remember tonight they be have their first guest the short would not be on the floor when he come home that evening he be wrong the rest of the bedroom have be groom to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lay the dishevel short they give the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face he saw that dolores intend to wait until the last minute think he would get nervous quietly he determine to foil her i can be a stubborn a she can he think my nerve be a strong she ll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell ring it ring ten minute early martin be stand a few foot from the front door he swing around eye toward the bedroom some fifteen foot away dolores stand motionless in the doorway he could not cross the live room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the short martin turn his back he stride to answer the bell bill s hat be deposit in the hall closet with the most casual and relax manner in the world dolores lead anthea to the bedroom martin strain his ear at first he could not be sure then he catch just enough to know that the short be still there a glissade of giggle slide over their voice all evening anthea favor him with odd coy look clearly she have be instruct not to say a word for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallow up every other topic at last there be a void no one could fill the brainards go home early martin realize late on that he should have have it out with dolores that night a violently a possible but he be so take aback he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fume while she stay calm and adamant and if he surrender after rave at her he shiver suppose he run up the white flag altogether at once he consider the sober possibility in his head be the echo of those titter with anthea there be something about private feminine whispering which always make him feel scabrous and unclean he remember his mother gossip with her neighborhood woman friend lower her voice to a penetrate hoarseness which might be trust to carry to the head of the stair where he crouch listen he could even recall the last time he sit there she be talk about him that time because he have do some bad thing something she dislike but afterwards martin say he be sorry he apologize so sweetly i couldn t keep be annoy with him it wasn t even true that he d say he be sorry that time he have in fact say simply that he wish the thing hadn t happen which be a honest a he could put it but his mother tell the story over and over till her martin say he be sorry be a much a part of her a the shape of her thin pallid ear the battle have to be fight let the best sex win but his resolution hardly seem to help if the situation have be bad it now get bad about this time people begin drop in consider that the newly marry have be leave alone long enough angrily martin wish they have delay the wedding and go on a trip preferably one that last month instead of decide not to postpone the date until he could get away here they be at the mercy of anyone who choose to come by these stray people nearly always insist on dolores show them around the apartment of course the tour of inspection include the ever present short it be curious how the different visitor take this some try to ignore the blot on the bedroom s countenance others ask quite a few laugh to them all dolores tell a lighthearted and witty tale it s a little contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carry the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course while he wait in the live room once martin go along they enter the bedroom and dolores say nothing then one of the guest show his merriment you be in a hurry weren t you martin would have like to break the man s neck dolores smile she let the interpretation stand now martin hear himself give a snort of mock good nature with her eye dolores dare him for the truth ready to begin it s a little contest never again do he enter into the ritual of show the apartment they keep up a rigid pretense of speak relation but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything what to talk about dolores keep pick up any of his clothe except the fatal short which he leave about but he have be rob of pleasure in scatter his possession he fell into the habit of put his clothe in drawer and closet so his life might impinge a little a possible on hers the short alone remain in his moment of worst agony martin imagine what his friend be say the sound of their amazement bizarre he could hear the word the most bizarre situation we be up to visit them and he have think her exactly what he want six week of marriage and i m use the past tense he tell himself furiously pursue his idea he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now everyone would know why he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure he be trap day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he have make for himself his mind scurry

when the solution finally come to him one night while he be in bed he be so shake by it simplicity that he could only wonder why it have not occur to him before in a frenzy of excitement he consider his plan beside his short he would place something of hers instantaneously he would have win an immeasurable moral victory for if she pick up say a pair of her panty she might just a well lift his short lie alongside the expenditure of energy be almost the same he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own underwear which he have lay on the floor furthermore he could go on repeat the maneuver endlessly every time he go in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle next to his short sooner or late dolores would crack on the other hand if she didn t remove her own thing it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guest which traverse the apartment martin guess that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story the tale he think would become less gay she have use his rumple short a the very image of his childishness his lack of control his general male loosen while she remain cool airy and untouched the charm teacher who discipline an unruly body to have her underclothes link with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd something in the back of his mind be aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believe in it since his courage and virility be involve because it be truly his the knowledge keep him from analyze his scheme to death and take him through the last hour of that night in a peace of exalt fanaticism the next morning while dolores be out of the room he go to her bureau drawer take

up my short too he saw that in a moment she have grasp all the implication of a plot which have be week in occur to him extend her finger another inch she catch up the short and swiftly leave the room she do not look at him but he notice that her face be flush and her eye unsteady they breakfast together but martin do not refer to his triumph and dolores find a great deal to do in the kitchen bob up and down from the table so that talk be impossible well martin think that ll save he leave for work in high spirit a he relax that day martin realize how tense he have be these past week he find

all over america a the hero of a great murder trial welch summon jail official to barco s cell but to welch s chagrin the police captain pooh poohed welch s credulity in barco s confession barco be clearly a nut it require strength bravado dare to commit murder that worm a murderer ridiculous then for the first time since his arrest a glint of spirit light barco s eye his manhood have be attack

elation grow a barco s seven disclosure bring to light one reward after another now do welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that follow in the procedure of justice be a new triumph for him it go to his head and his ambition increase it be apparent that welch be in cahoot with marshall and would use his power a d a to drag every possible sensation into the case every new scandal which would provide more copy for marshall s pen would thus mean more publicity for welch i know that both these cynic be wait with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola be call to the stand once there the d a with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headline viola s multiple romance viola lake an addict downfall of another film idol it would be fine publicity for the man who be will to walk to the mayor s throne over the break reputation of a helpless girl i study welch closely a the trial progress for any hint which might give me a lead a to how he might be thwart it wasn t long before i sense that there be something deep than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for viola s destruction he be bitter and resentful toward her personally resentful a dreadful fear enter my consciousness that perhaps he have entertain aspiration toward viola s favor or even more serious perhaps that he have attain a share of them and have then be supersede by some lucky chap i do not rest until i have track the mystery down well here it be one day over a year before there have be a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel viola have be urge to attend by telephone and not know the host or the character of the party she have go she arrive late and a she enter the party note that gentleman seem to be in the majority the air be thick with smoke empty bottle be in evidence and several of the guest be somewhat the bad for liquor naturally viola have no wish to remain but she felt she couldn t leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her host and it so happen that adjacent to a couch on which she have take refuge be a small table on which she note a vase of red rosebud while project from beneath the couch be a pair of foot which a fate would have it belong to district attorney welch a viola sit there a playful impulse overcome her to remove the shoe and sock from the unidentified foot and a a prank insert rosebud between the toe a little late the district attorney wake up emerge from under the couch look at his watch and realize he have an engagement that very hour to address a meet of the culture forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife a president of the forum be to preside he make his way to his host s bedroom where he carefully brush himself off neatly arrange his hair and painstakingly select his hat from the many on the bed then note neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebud he make his way to the byzantine room and with his usual dignity mount the rostrum the effect on the intellectual among his audience may well be imagine the incident aside from reflect on welch s political career have all but wreck his home life he never rest until he discover who the culprit be and when he do he vow vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance come his way and here it be by such innocent action be human tragedy sometimes set in motion during these first day of the trial i didn t have a much time to commiserate with viola a i should have like in the first place it be difficult for u to meet we couldn t be see together for the tongue of scandal be ever ready to link our name and the tongue of scandal find but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl no matter how innocent i couldn t invite viola to our house for mother snobbishly refuse to receive her now the czarship have not affect my own sense of social value but mother have attain a reflect glory through it which have open the door of los angeles pasadena

mother even go so far a to trump up for me matrimonial opportunity with pasadena deb who have be educate abroad and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante be a girl who have be to high school but at long last come a time when i break away from mother and her society chi chi in order to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home however such a hotbed of gossip have grow up during the trial that every precaution have to be take to keep my visit from be whisper to the world society and even ala to my own mother when i arrive at viola s i be show to my

more warmth and less poise give a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter include devil s island and the remote reach of siberia i promise to illustrate the lecture if they so much a breathe till after the call be complete speak into the phone again and recognize the caller i resume my everyday voice soon we be deep in a conversation that be interrupt many time by little thing like jennie s hold her breath and pretend to black out miranda s dump the content of the sugar bowl on the table and various screech thud and giggle under the circumstance i have difficulty keep up with the conversation on the phone but when i hang up i be reasonably certain that francesca have want to remind me of our town meet the next evening and how important it be that hank and i be there i discover that the girl have shrewdly vacate the kitchen and be play quietly in the live room it seem that i would be the gainer if i accept the peace and quiet instead of carry out my threat resolve to get something do i start in on the dish no i m not say it right what i mean to say be that i start to start in on the dish by gather them all together in the kitchen sink they look so formidable however so demand that i find myself star at them in dismay and start to woolgather again this time about francesca and her husband how about them i think francesca and herbert be among the few people we know in catatonia we didn t even know them till about a month after we move at that time they have call on u after i meet fran at a pta meet and have take u in hand socially they have be kind to u and we be indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinner and for information a to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter to call not that there be much of a choice since catatonia be just a village the yellow page of the telephone book be amazingly thin they be personality herb an expert on narrow tie thin lapel and swatch be men s fashion editor of parvenu the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation fran and he have meet about two year after she have arrive in manhattan from nebraska or be it wyoming she be the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and have arrive in new york with a big bank roll become a dabbler in various field she patronize greenwich village artist for awhile then put some money into a broadway show which be successful terrible but successful it be during her write period that she and herb meet and decide that they be in love they be marry at a lavish ceremony which be duly record in parvenu and all other magazine and newspaper and then they honeymoon in bermuda no not bermuda bermuda be not in style that year they have honeymoon in rome everyone be very high on rome that year they have buy their house in catatonia after investigate all the region of suburbia surround new york they have chosen catatonia because of it reputation for excellent school beach and abundance of name you be bind to get involve with people when you have child fran have tell me at our first meet so it be good to know that those with whom you get involve be not just dreary little housewife and dull husband but people who do thing i admire their easy way of do thing but i couldn t escape an uneasiness at their way of always do the right thing their house be a century old colonial which they have have restore guide by an eminent architect and update and add on to it have a gourmet s corner instead of a kitchen a breakfast room a luncheon room a din room a sit room a room for stand up a party room dress room for everybody even a room for mud it be all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their child would color in the color room paint in the painting room play with block in the block house and do all the other thing in the proper room at exactly the right time their two boy be well adjust and like their parent always do the right thing at the right time and damn the consequence francesca and herbert consider themselves violently nonconformist and show the world they be by fill their colonial house with contemporary furniture and painting and other art object expensive but not necessarily valuable contemporary thing fran flaunt her independence by rebel against the catatonia uniform of bermuda short and knee length sock by wear bermuda short and knee length sock in color bright pink and plaid and vivid strip sometimes she even wear the uniform in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely wear this uniform she strongly resemble a member of the s no one could dislike them i think sometimes though they do not seem quite human it seem indeed that their house be not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they be actor who have be hand fat role in a successful play and have talent enough to fill the role competently with nice understatement practically the only enthusiasm they show be when they be discuss name even brand name you should hear the reverence in fran s voice when she say baccarat or steuben or madame alexander she always let it be know that there be wine in the pot roast or that the chicken have be marinate in brandy and that koussevitzky s second cousin be an intimate of theirs i wouldn t have waste time puzzle over this couple be it not for my fear that all the other inhabitant of catatonia be equally unreal i couldn t feel at home among them besides francesca there be blanche francesca be pleasant and charm but blanche be sweet yes blanche be very very sweet be in her company be like be drown in warm melt marshmallow i have once be a witness when blanche have smile and say with only minimum ruefulness oh my souffle have collapse anyone know how a real red blood woman would react to such a catastrophe if blanche have be honest she would have yell slam at least a couple of door and throw a few little valueless thing but dear me no not blanche after five minute with blanche one might welcome the astringency of grazie who be a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca s perle mesta francesca and grazie be habitual committee chairman and they usually manage to be elect co chairman equal boss of whatever pta or civic project be be launch they be inseparable not because they be fond of each other but because they want to keep an eye on each other a they be keen rival for social leadership grazie be mean quietly mean and bitterly unfunnily sarcastic she it be who have look to see if i be wear shoe upon learn that i couldn t drive grazie have a small slick head and her hair and skin be the color of golden toast she live in an ultra modern house whose decoration appointment paint and even pet be chosen to complement her color the pet be a couple of siamese cat her uniform be of rich raw silk in a shade which match her hair skin housepaint and cat and since she be so thin a to be almost shapeless she rather resemble a freeze fish stick the husband of these woman and others i have meet in catatonia be distinguish only in that they be to me at least indistinguishable i couldn t tell one from the other like herbert they be all in communication radio television magazine and advertising one or two be writer of book all be fellow of finite charm each have develop a hair trigger chuckle and the habit of say zounds in deference to country squirehood i never think i d live to hear people chuckle and say zounds in real life i wouldn t have miss it for anything they be sincere men of the too hearty handclasp and the urgent smile these boy acknowledge an introduction to anybody by gently press one of his hand in both of theirs while they gaze misty eye with care into the eye of the person they be meet could such unadulterated love for a total stranger be credit they be always leap to light cigarette open car door fill plate or glass and i mistrust the whole lot of them to the same degree that i mistrust bake shop that call themselves sanitary bake shop o pioneer i think and wonder what kind of homestead such odd pioneer would establish in this suburban frontier pioneer who look like off duty gardener even at parent teacher conference and who never call the school principal mister i sigh think that among other thing people here seem to be those who would have to cut down if they earn less than yearly people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on person to person people who think it be nice to be important but not important to be nice who be more ingratiate than gracious more personality than person in my estimation they be people who read daphne du maurier and discuss kafka well not discuss him exactly but say kafka reverently and raise their eye a if they be at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka which they be because they have no opinion about kafka not have read kafka they be i felt people invariably try to prove not who but what they be and try to determine what not who others be become aware that it be nearly lunchtime i bring myself back to the task at hand i make plan for the afternoon do the breakfast and luncheon dish all at once make the bed and then maybe painting the kitchen then i remember

cereal for breakfast i dig around and find a mix and be able to surprise them with a devil s food cake with chocolate icing sometimes i think you need only one rule for cook if you can t put garlic in it put chocolate in it the cake be receive in a stun silence that be evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrill mama have be provide then jennie close her eye stretch forth her arm and say take my hand louise i m a stranger in paradise

to the former group and he be struggle unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demand none which be positively antagonistic to it and then again perhaps the reason why he couldn t find time to do any of the thing he have plan to do after retirement read roam gardening lie on his back and watch the cloud go by be because he didn t want to do them there be no compulsion behind them they could be do or leave undo and nobody really give a damn during all his busy life he have only do thing which have to be do this habit have become so fix over the year that it seem futile to do anything for which no one be wait he look at the luminous dial of his wrist watch it be five minute after four on some distant farm a rooster crow and far down the valley an associate answer he turn over impatiently and pull the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop thus commit action might follow he go down to mill and bradley s hardware store and buy a full set of carpenter s tool include a rotary power saw and several other piece of power machinery that mr mill say be essential for babbiting and doweling whatever they be he also buy a huge square of pegboard for hang up his tool and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assort nail level and t square and plumb line and several gadget that he have no idea how to use or what they be for there say mr mill that ll get you start best not to get everything at once add thing a you find you need em he didn t even ask the cost of this collection after all if you be go to set up a workshop you have to have the proper equipment and that be that when he return home the station wagon load with tool jinny have go with a friend to some meet in the village use the recently purchase second car he be glad it give him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comment he have make such a fuss about buy that second car that he know he be vulnerable he pile everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turn to stare at the blank stone wall that be where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tool in front of it would be his workbench the old nightmare which have cause him so many wakeful hour come charge in on him once more only this time he couldn t pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away how in the world do one attach a pegboard to a stone wall how do one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter after the pegboard there would be the panel he sit down on an old box and focus on the problem perhaps one bore hole in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget but then when you stick thing into the hole why didn t they come right out again it all seem rather hopeless he turn his attention to the workbench perhaps that be the first thing to do a workbench have a heavy top and sturdy leg but how do you attach sturdy leg to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn t wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you lean on it mr mill have do some figure on a scrap of paper and give him the various kind of board and two by four which properly handle would he have assure him turn into a workbench they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile mr crombie poke at it gingerly with his foot how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that perhaps he have well have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench someone who know what he be about then at least he would have a place to hang his tool and something to work on after that everything should be simple he go upstairs to phone crumb to his amazement he reach him mr crumb be lay up with a bad cold he didn t seem to think that attach a pegboard to a stone wall be much of a problem and he toss off the build of the worktable equally lightly the only trouble be that he himself be tie up on the school job that be why he hadn t be able to finish the porch no he didn t know of any handyman carpenter there wasn t any such thing any more carpenter all want steady work and at the moment every mother s son for twenty mile around that could hammer nail for twenty five dollar a day be work on the school job there be a fellow name blatz over smithtown way nobody like to hire him because you never could tell when he be go to be take drink mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meet the next night if he be sober which be doubtful he d have him get in touch with mr crombie mr blatz have be at least sober enough to remember to
