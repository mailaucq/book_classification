hour win ’ t hurt her ” say clovis with the air of one who have take everything into consideration “ one of your men could bring her over from pabham park after dusk and with a little help he ought to be able to smuggle her into the conservatory at the same moment that mary hampton make an unobtrusive exit ” lord pabham star at clovis for a moment in pardonable bewilderment then his face break into a wrinkle network of laughter “ oh that ’ s your game be it you be go to do a little siberian magic on your own account and be mr hampton will to be a fellow conspirator ” “ mary be pledge to see me through with it if you will guarantee louisa ’ s temper ” “ i ’ ll answer for louisa ” say lord pabham by the follow day the house party have swell to large proportion and bilsiter ’ s instinct for

eloquence continue unabated while coffee be be serve in the draw room preparatory to a general migration to the card room his aunt ensure a respectful hearing for his utterance but her sensation love soul hanker after something more dramatic than mere vocal demonstration “ win ’ t you do something to convince them of your power leonard ” she plead “ change something into another shape he can you know if he only choose to ” she inform the company “ oh do ” say mavis pellington earnestly and her request be echo by nearly everyone present even those who be not open to conviction be perfectly will to be entertain by an exhibition of amateur conjure leonard felt that something tangible be expect of him “ have anyone present ” he ask “ get a three penny bit or some small object of no particular value— ” “ you ’ re surely not go to make coin disappear or something primitive of that sort ” say clovis contemptuously “ i think it very unkind of you not to carry out my suggestion of turn me into a wolf ” say mary hampton a she cross over to the conservatory to give her macaw their usual tribute from the dessert dish “ i have already warn you of the danger of treat these power in

it back ” “ i—i don ’ t know how to ” falter leonard who look more scar and horrify than anyone “ what ” shout colonel hampton “ you ’ ve take the abominable liberty of turn my wife into a wolf and now you stand there calmly and say you can ’ t turn her back again ” to do strict justice to leonard calmness be not a distinguish feature of his attitude at the moment “ i assure you i didn ’ t turn mr hampton into a wolf nothing be far from my intention ” he protest “ then where be she and how come that animal into the conservatory ” demand the colonel “ of course we must accept your assurance that you didn ’ t turn mr hampton into a wolf ” say clovis politely “ but you will agree that appearance be against you ” “ be we to have all these recrimination with that beast stand there ready to tear u to piece ” wail mavis indignantly “ lord pabham you know a good deal about wild beasts— ” suggest colonel hampton “ the wild beast that i have be accustom to ” say lord pabham “ have come with proper credential from well know dealer or have be breed in my own menagerie i ’ ve never before be confront with an animal that walk unconcernedly out of an azalea bush leave a charm and popular hostess unaccounted for a far a one can judge from outward characteristic ” he continue “ it have the appearance of a well grow female of the north american timber wolf a variety of the common specie canis lupus ” “ oh never mind it latin name ” scream mavis a the beast come a step or two far into the room “ can ’ t you entice it away with food and shut it up where it can ’ t do any harm ” “ if it be really mr hampton who have just have a very good dinner i don ’ t suppose food will appeal to it very strongly ” say clovis “ leonard ” beseech mr hoop tearfully “ even if this be none of your do can ’ t you use your great power to turn this dreadful beast into something harmless before it bite u all—a rabbit or something ” “ i don ’ t suppose colonel hampton would care to have his wife turn into a succession of fancy animal a though we be play a round game with her ” interpose clovis “ i absolutely forbid it ” thunder the colonel “ most wolf that i ’ ve have anything to do with have be inordinately fond of sugar ” say lord pabham “ if you like i ’ ll try the effect on this one ” he take a piece of sugar from the saucer of his coffee cup and fling it to the expectant louisa who snap it in mid air there be a sigh of relief from the company a wolf that eat sugar when it might at the least have be employ in tear macaw to piece have already shed some of it terror the sigh deepen to a gasp of thanks give when lord pabham decoy the animal out of the room by a pretend largesse of far sugar there be an instant rush to the vacate conservatory there be no trace of mr hampton except the plate contain the macaw ’ supper “ the door be lock on the inside ” exclaim clovis who have deftly turn the key a he affect to test it everyone turn towards bilsiter “ if you haven ’ t turn my wife into a wolf ” say colonel hampton “ will you kindly explain where she have disappear to since she obviously could not have go through a lock door i will not press you for an explanation of how a north american timber wolf suddenly appear in the conservatory but i think i have some right to inquire what have become of mr hampton ” bilsiter ’ s reiterate disclaimer be meet with a general murmur of impatient disbelief “ i refuse to stay another hour under this roof ” declare mavis pellington “ if our hostess have really vanish out of human form ” say mr hoop “ none of the lady of the party can very well remain i absolutely decline to be chaperon by a wolf ” “ it ’ s a she wolf ” say clovis soothingly the correct etiquette to be observe under the unusual circumstance receive no far elucidation the sudden entry of mary hampton deprive the discussion of it immediate interest “ some one have mesmerise me ” she exclaim crossly “ i find myself in the game larder of all place be feed with sugar by lord pabham i hate be mesmerise and the doctor have forbid me to touch sugar ” the situation be explain to her a far a it permit of anything that could be call explanation “ then you really do turn me into a wolf mr bilsiter ” she exclaim excitedly but leonard have burn the boat in which he might now have embark on a sea of glory he could only shake his head feebly “ it be i who take that liberty ” say clovis “ you see i happen to have live for a couple of year in north eastern russia and i have more than a tourist ’ s acquaintance with the magic craft of that region one do not care to speak about these strange power but once in a way when one hear a lot of nonsense be talk about them one be tempt to show what siberian magic can accomplish in the hand of someone who really understand it i yield to that temptation may i have some brandy the effort have leave me rather faint ” if leonard bilsiter could at that moment have transform clovis into a cockroach and then have step on him he would gladly have perform both operation laura “ you be not really die be you ” ask amanda “ i have the doctor ’ s permission to live till tuesday ” say laura “ but to day be saturday this be serious ” gasp amanda “ i don ’ t know about it be serious it be certainly saturday ” say laura “ death be always serious ” say amanda “ i never say i be go to die i be presumably go to leave off be laura but i shall go on be something an animal of some kind i suppose you see when one hasn ’ t be very good in the life one have just live one reincarnate in some lower organism and i haven ’ t be very good when one come to think of it i ’ ve be petty and mean and vindictive and all that sort of thing when circumstance have seem to warrant it ” “ circumstance never warrant that sort of thing ” say amanda hastily “ if you don ’ t mind my say so ” observe laura “ egbert be a circumstance that would warrant any amount of that sort of thing you ’ re marry to him—that ’ s different you ’ ve swear to love honour and endure him i haven ’ t ” “ i don ’ t see what ’ s wrong with egbert ” protest amanda “ oh i daresay the wrongness have be on my part ” admit laura dispassionately “ he have merely be the extenuate circumstance he make a thin peevish kind of fuss for instance when i take the collie puppy from the farm out for a run the other day ” “ they chase his young brood of speckle sussex and drive two sit hen off their nest besides run all over the flower bed you know how devote he be to his poultry and garden ” “ anyhow he needn ’ t have go on about

even if he be no more than a casual acquaintance about to cross the serpentine so with our book there be dearly love book of which we babble to a neighbour at dinner insist that she shall share our delight in them and there be book equally dear to u of which we say nothing fear lest the praise of others should cheapen the glory of our discovery the book of saki be for me at least in the second class it be in the westminster gazette that i discover him i like to remember now almost a soon a he be discoverable let u spare a moment and a tear for those golden day in the early nineteen hundred when there be five leisurely paper of an evening in which the free lance might graduate and he could speak of his alma mater whether the globe or the pall mall with a much pride a he never doubt the globe or the pall mall would speak one day of him myself but lately down from st james i be not too proud to take some slight but pity interest in men of other college the unusual name of a freshman up at westminster attract my attention i read what he have to say and it be only by recite rapidly with close eye the name of our own famous alumnus begin confidently with barrie and ending now very doubtfully with myself that i be able to preserve my equanimity late one hear that this undergraduate from overseas have go up at an age more advance than customary and just a cambridge men have be know to complain of the maturity of oxford rhodes scholar so one felt that this westminster free lance in the thirty be no fit competitor for the youth of other college indeed it could not compete well i discover him but only to the few the favour do i speak of him it may have be my uncertainty which still persist whether he call himself sayki sahki or sakki which make me thus ungenerous of his name or it may have be the feel that the others be not worthy of him but how refresh it be when some intellectually blow up stranger say do you ever read saki to reply with the same pronunciation and even great condescension saki he have be my favourite author for year a strange exotic creature this saki to u many others who be try to do it too for we be so domestic he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan

less thrill than clovis sangrail would do in our envy we may have wonder sometimes if it be not much easy to be funny with tiger than with collar stud if saki s careless cruelty that strange boyish insensitiveness of his do not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter it may have be so but fortunately our effort to be funny in the saki manner have not survive to prove it what be saki s manner what his magic talisman like every artist worth consideration he have no recipe if his exotic choice of subject be often his strength it be often his weakness if his insensitiveness carry him through at time to victory it bring him at time to defeat i do not think that he have that mastery of the conte in this book at least which some have claim for him such mastery infer a passion for tidiness which be not in the boyish saki s equipment he leave loose end everywhere nor in his dialogue delightful a it often be funny a it nearly always be be he the supreme master too much do it

you see neither of u could afford to make the other a separate allowance in spite of everything that proverb may say poverty keep together more home than it break up but we always hunt with different pack all this have nothing to do with the story we haven t arrive at the meet yet i suppose there be a meet say clovis of course there be a meet say the baroness all the usual crowd be there especially constance broddle constance be one of those strap florid girl that go so well with autumn scenery or christmas decoration in church i feel a presentiment that something dreadful be go to happen she say to me be i look pale she be look about a pale a a beetroot that have suddenly hear bad news you re look nice than usual i say but that s so easy for you before she have get the right bear of this remark we have settle down to business hound have find a fox lie out in some gorse bush i know it say clovis in every fox hunt story that i ve ever hear there s be a fox and some gorse bush constance and i be well mount continue the baroness serenely and we have no difficulty in keep ourselves in the first flight though it be a fairly stiff run towards the finish however we must have hold rather too independent a line for we lose the hound and find ourselves plodding aimlessly along mile away from anywhere it be fairly exasperate and my temper be begin to let itself go by inch when on push our way through an accommodate hedge we be gladden by the sight of hound in full cry in a hollow just beneath u there they go cry constance and then add in a gasp in heaven s name what be they hunt it be certainly no mortal fox it stand more than twice a high have a short ugly head and an enormous thick neck it s a hyaena i cry it must have escape from lord pabham s park at that moment the hunt beast turn and face it pursuer and the hound there be only about six couple of them stand round in a half circle and look foolish evidently they have break away from the rest of the pack on the trail of this alien scent and be not quite sure how to treat their quarry now they have get him the hyaena hail our approach with unmistakable relief and demonstration of friendliness it have probably be accustom to uniform kindness from human while it first experience of a pack of hound have leave a bad impression the hound look more than ever embarrass a their quarry parade it sudden intimacy with u and the faint toot of a horn in the distance be seize on a a welcome signal for unobtrusive departure constance and i and the hyaena be leave alone in the gather twilight what be we to do ask constance what a person you be for question i say well we can t stay here all night with a hyaena she retort i don t know what your idea of comfort be i say but i shouldn t think of stay here all night even without a hyaena my home may be an unhappy one but at least it have hot and cold water lay on and domestic service and other convenience which we shouldn t find here we have well make for that ridge of tree to the right i imagine the crowley road be just beyond we trot off slowly along a faintly mark cart track with the beast follow cheerfully at our heel what on earth be we to do with the hyaena come the inevitable question what do one generally do with hyaena i ask crossly i ve never have anything to do with one before say constance well neither have i if we even know it sex we might give it a name perhaps we might call it esmé that would do in either case there be still sufficient daylight for u to distinguish wayside object and our listless spirit give an upward perk a we come upon a small half naked gipsy brat pick blackberry from a low grow bush the sudden apparition of two horsewoman and a hyaena set it off cry and in any case we should scarcely have glean any useful geographical information from that source but there be a probability that we might strike a gipsy encampment somewhere along our route we ride on hopefully but uneventfully for another mile or so i wonder what that child be do there say constance presently pick blackberry obviously i don t like the way it cry pursue constance somehow it wail keep ring in my ear i do not chide constance for her morbid fancy a a matter of fact the same sensation of be pursue by a persistent fretful wail have be force itself on my rather over tire nerve for company s sake i hulloed to

something she persist tearfully a esmé canter easily along in front of our tire horse personally i be do everything that occur to me at the moment i storm and scold and coax in english and french and gamekeeper language i make absurd ineffectual cut in the air with my thongless hunt crop i hurl my sandwich case at the brute in fact i really don t know what more i could have do and still we lumber on through the deepen dusk with that dark uncouth shape lumber ahead of u and a drone of lugubrious music float in our ear suddenly esmé bound aside into some thick bush where we could not follow the wail rise to a shriek and then stop altogether this part of the story i always hurry over because it be really rather horrible when the beast join u again after an absence of a few minute there be an air of patient understand about him a though he know that he have do something of which we disapprove but which he felt to be thoroughly justifiable how can you let that raven beast trot by your side ask constance she be look more than ever like an albino beetroot in the first place i can t prevent it i say and in the second place whatever else he may be i doubt if he s raven at the present moment constance shudder do you think the poor little thing suffer much come another of her futile question the indication be all that way i say on the other hand of course it may have be cry from sheer temper child sometimes do it be nearly pitch dark when we emerge suddenly into the highroad a flash of light and the whir of a motor go past u at the same moment at uncomfortably close quarter a thud and a sharp screeching yell follow a second late the car draw up and when i have ride back to the spot i find a young man bend over a dark motionless mass lie by the roadside you have kill my esmé i

year i say resolutely constance snort loudly don t cry dear i say brokenly it be all over in a moment he couldn t have suffer much look here say the young fellow desperately you simply must let me do

way and in her own time to be govern by ambition be only a shade or two well than be govern by convention the draw room in which she and ronnie be sit be of such proportion that one hardly know whether it be intend to be one room or several and it have the merit of be moderately cool at two o clock on a particularly hot july afternoon in the cool of it many alcove servant have noiselessly

cicely rise from her seat and go over to the piano come she say touch the young man lightly with a finger tip on the top of his very sleek copper hue head we re go to have picnic lunch to day up here it s so much cooler than any of the downstairs room and we shan t be bother with the servant trot in and out all the time rather a good idea of mine wasn t it ronnie after look anxiously to see that the word picnic do not portend tongue sandwich and biscuit give the idea his blessing what be young storre s profession some one have once ask concern him he have a great many friend who have independent income have be the answer the meal be begin in an appreciative silence a picnic in which three kind of red pepper be available for the caviare demand a certain amount of respectful attention my heart ought to be like a sing bird to day i suppose say cicely presently because your good man be come home ask ronnie cicely nod he s expect some time this afternoon though i m rather vague a to which train he arrive by rather a stifle day for railway travel and be your heart do the sing bird business ask ronnie that depend say cicely if i may choose the bird a missel thrush would do perhaps it sing loud in stormy weather i believe ronnie dispose of two or three stem of asparagus before make any comment on this remark be there go to be stormy weather he ask the domestic barometer be set rather that way say cicely you see murrey have be away for ever so long and of course there will be lot of thing he win t be use to and i m afraid matter may be rather strain and uncomfortable for a time do you mean that he will object to me ask ronnie not in the least say cicely he s quite broad mind on most subject and he realise that this be an age in which sensible people know thoroughly well what they want and be determine to get what they want it plea me to see a lot of you and to spoil you and pay you extravagant compliment about your good look and your music and to imagine at time that i m in danger of get fond of you i don t see any harm in it and i don t suppose murrey will either in fact i shouldn t be surprise if he take rather a like to you no it s the general situation that will trouble and exasperate him he s not have time to get accustom to the fait accompli like we have it will break on him with horrible suddenness he be somewhere in russia when the war break out wasn t he say ronnie somewhere in the wild of eastern siberia shoot and bird collect mile away from a railway or telegraph line and it be all over before he know anything about it it didn t last very long when you come to think of it he be due home somewhere about that time and when the week slip by without my hearing from him i quite think he d be capture in the baltic or somewhere on the way back it turn out that he be down with marsh fever in some out of the way spot and everything be over and finish with before he get back to civilisation and newspaper it must have be a bit of a shock say ronnie busy with a well devise salad still i don t see why there should be domestic storm when he come back you be hardly responsible for the catastrophe that have happen no say cicely but he ll come back naturally feel sore and savage with everything he see around him and he win t realise just at once that we ve be through all that ourselves and have reach the stage of sullen acquiescence in what can t be help he win t understand for instance how we can be enthusiastic and excite over gorla mustelford s debut and thing of that sort he ll think we be a set of callous reveller fiddle while rome be burn in this case say ronnie rome isn t burn it s burn all that remain to be do be to rebuild it when possible exactly and he ll say we re not do much towards help at that but protest ronnie the whole thing have only just happen rome wasn t build in a day and we can t rebuild our rome in a day i know say cicely but so many of our friend and especially murrey s friend have take the thing in a tragical fashion and clear off to the colony or shut themselves up in their country house a though there be a sort of moral leprosy infect london i don t see what good that do say ronnie it doesn t do any good but it s what a lot of them have do because they felt like do it and murrey will feel like do it too that be where i foresee trouble and disagreement ronnie shrug his shoulder i would take thing tragically if i saw the good of it he say a matter stand it s too late in the day and too early to be anything but philosophical about what one can t help for the present we ve just get to make the best of thing besides you can t very well turn down gorla at the last moment i m not go to turn down gorla or anybody say cicely with decision i think it would be silly and silliness doesn t appeal to me that be why i foresee storm on the domestic horizon after all gorla have her career to think of do you know she add with a change of tone i rather wish you would fall in love with gorla it would make me horribly jealous and a little jealousy be such a good tonic for any woman who know how to dress well also ronnie it would prove that you be capable of fall in love with some one of which i ve grave doubt up to the present love be one of the few thing in which the make believe be superior to the genuine say ronnie it last long and you get more fun out of it and it s easy to replace when you ve do with it still it s rather like play with colour paper instead of play with fire object cicely a footman come round the corner with the train silence that tactfully contrive to make itself felt mr luton to see you madam he announce shall i say you be in mr luton oh yes say cicely he ll probably have something to tell u about gorla s concert she add

valet companion to a roving invalid din now and then on plover egg and asparagus at one of the smart west end restaurant at other time devour a kipper or a sausage in some stuffy edgware road eat house always seemingly amuse by life and always amuse it be possible that somewhere in such heart a he possess there lurk a rankle bitterness against the hard thing of life or a scrap of gratitude towards the one or two friend who have help him disinterestedly but his most intimate associate could not have guess at the existence of such feel tony luton be just a merry eye dance faun whom fate have surround with street instead of wood and it would have be in the high degree inartistic to have sound him for a heart or a heartache the dance of the faun take one day a lively and more assure

droop music hall industry be at the moment badly in need it be just after the great catastrophe and men of the london world be in no humour to think they have witness the inconceivable befall them they have nothing but political ruin to stare at and they be anxious to look the other way the word of tony s song be more or less meaningless though he sing them remarkably well but the tune with it air of slyness and furtive joyousness appeal in some unaccountable manner to people who be furtively unhappy and who be try to appear stoically cheerful what must be must be and it s a poor heart that never rejoice be the popular expression of the london public at that moment and the men who have to cater for that public be thankful when they be able to stumble across anything that fit in with the prevail mood for the first time in his life tony luton discover that agent and manager be a leisured class and that office boy have manner he enter cicely s draw room with the air of one to whom assurance of manner have become a sheathe weapon a court accessory rather than a trade implement he be more quietly dress than the usual run of music hall success he have look critically at life from too many angle not to know that though clothe can not make a man they can certainly damn him thank you i have lunch already he say in answer to a question from cicely thank you he say again in a cheerful affirmative a the question of hock in a tall ice cold goblet be propound to him i ve come to tell you the late about the gorla mustelford evening he continue old laurent be put his back into it and it s really go to be rather a big affair she s go to out russian the russian of course she hasn t their technique nor a tenth of their train but she s have ton of advertisement the name gorla

laurent say observe tony he discover temperament in every one that he intend to boom he tell me that i have temperament to the finger tip and i be too polite to contradict him but i haven t tell you the really important thing about the mustelford debut it be a profound secret more or less so you must promise not to breathe a word about it till half past four when it will appear in all the six o clock newspaper tony pause for dramatic effect while he drain his goblet and then make his announcement majesty be go to be present informally and unofficially but still present in the flesh a sort of casual drop in carefully herald by unconfirmed rumour a week ahead heaven exclaim cicely in genuine excitement what a bold stroke lady shalem have work that i bet i suppose it will go down all right trust laurent to see to that say tony he know how to fill his house with the right sort of people and he s not the one to risk a fiasco he know what he s about i tell you it s go to be a big evening i say exclaim ronnie suddenly give a supper party here for gorla on the night and ask the shalem woman and all her crowd it will be awful fun cicely catch at the suggestion with some enthusiasm she do not particularly care for lady shalem but she think it would be just a well to care for her a far a outward appearance go grace lady shalem be a woman who have blossom into sudden importance by constitute herself a sort of foster mother to the fait accompli at a moment when london be denude of most of it aforetime social leader she have see her opportunity and make the most of it she have

asunder of francesca from the shelter habitation that have grow to be her soul it be true that in imagination she have build herself a bridge across the chasm a bridge of a single span the bridge in question be her schoolboy son comus now be educate somewhere in the southern county or rather one should say the bridge consist of the possibility of his eventual marriage with emmeline in which case francesca saw herself still reign a trifle squeeze and incommode perhaps but still reign in the house in blue street the van der meulen would still catch it requisite afternoon light in it place of

solemnly a though they have be ordain in some immemorial book of observance fate have be undisguisedly kind to her he might so easily have marry some pretty helpless little woman and live at notting hill gate and be the father of a long string of pale clever useless child who would have have birthday and the sort of illness that one be expect to send grape to and who would have paint fatuous object in a south kensington manner a christmas offer to an aunt whose cubic space for lumber be limit instead of commit these unbrotherly action which be so frequent in family life that they might almost be call brotherly henry have marry a woman who have both money and a sense of repose and their one child have the brilliant virtue of never say anything which even it parent could consider worth repeat then he have go into parliament possibly with the idea of make his home life seem less dull at any rate it redeem his career from insignificance for no man whose death can produce the item “ another by election ” on the news poster can be wholly a nonentity henry in short who might have be an embarrassment and a handicap have chosen rather to be a friend and counsellor at time even an emergency bank balance francesca on her part with the partiality which a clever and lazily incline woman often feel for a reliable fool not only seek his counsel but frequently follow it when convenient moreover she repay his loan against this good service on the part of fate in provide her with henry for a brother francesca could well set the plaguy malice of the destiny that have give her comus for a son the boy be one of those untameable young lord of misrule that frolic and chafe themselves through nursery and preparatory and public school day with the utmost allowance of storm and dust and dislocation and the least possible amount of collar work and come somehow with a laugh through a series of catastrophe that have reduce everyone else concern to tear or cassandra like foreboding sometimes they sober down in after life and become uninteresting forget that they be ever lord of anything sometimes fate play royally into their hand and they do great thing in a spacious manner and be thank by parliament and the press and acclaim by gala day crowd but in most case their tragedy begin when they leave school and turn themselves loose in a world that have grow too civilise and too crowd and too empty to have any place for them and they be very many henry greech have make an end of bite small sandwich and settle down like a dust storm refresh to discus one of the fashionably prevalent topic of the moment the prevention of destitution “ it be a question that be only be nibble at smelt at one might say at the present moment ” he observe “ but it be one that will have to engage our serious attention and consideration before long the first thing that we shall have to do be to get out of the dilettante and academic way of approach it we must collect and assimilate hard fact it be a subject that ought to appeal to all think mind and yet you know i find it surprisingly difficult to interest people in it ” francesca make some monosyllabic response a sort of sympathetic grunt which be mean to indicate that she be to a certain extent listen and appreciate in reality she be reflect that henry possibly find it difficult to interest people in any topic that he enlarge on his talent lay so thoroughly in the direction of be uninteresting that even a an eye witness of the massacre of st bartholomew he would probably have infuse a flavour of boredom into his description of the event “ i be speak down in leicestershire the other day on this subject ” continue henry “ and i point out at some length a thing that few people ever stop to consider— ” francesca go over immediately but decorously to the majority that will not stop to consider “ do you come across any of the barnets when you be down there ” she interrupt “ eliza barnet be rather take up with all those subject ” in the propagandist movement of sociology a in other arena of life and struggle the fiercest competition and rivalry be frequently to be find between closely allied type and specie eliza barnet share many of henry greech ’ s political and social view but she also share his fondness for point thing out at some length there have be occasion when she have extensively occupy the strictly limit span allot to the platform oratory of a group of speaker of whom henry greech have be an impatient unit he might see eye to eye with her on the lead question of the day but he persistently wear mental blinker a far a her estimable quality be concern and the mention of her name be a skilful lure draw across the trail of his discourse if francesca have to listen to his eloquence on any subject she much prefer that it should be a disparagement of eliza barnet rather than the prevention of destitution “ i ’ ve no doubt she mean well ” say henry “ but it would be a good thing if she could be induce to keep her own personality a little more in the background and not to imagine that she be the necessary mouthpiece of all the progressive think in the

volume the interval with the exception of the last few month have be chiefly spend by the author toss about on the wide ocean sailor be the only class of men who now a day see anything like stir adventure and many thing which to fire side people appear strange and romantic to them seem a common place a a jacket out at elbow yet notwithstanding the familiarity of sailor with all sort of curious adventure the incident record in the follow page have often serve when ‘ spin a a yarn ’ not only to relieve the weariness of many a night watch at sea but to excite the warm sympathy of the author ’ s shipmate he have be therefore lead to think that his story could scarcely fail to interest those who be less familiar than the sailor with a life of adventure in his account of the singular and interest people among whom he be throw it will be observe that he chiefly treat of their more obvious peculiarity and in describe their custom refrain in most case from enter into explanation concern their origin and purpose a writer of travel among barbarous community be generally very diffuse on these subject he deem it right to advert to what may be consider a culpable omission no one can be more sensible than the author of his deficiency in this and many other respect but when the very peculiar circumstance in which he be place be understand he feel assure that all these omission will be excuse in very many publish narrative no little degree of attention be bestow upon date but a the author lose all knowledge of the day of the week during the occurrence of the scene herein relate he hop that the reader will charitably pass over his shortcoming in this particular in the polynesian word use in this volume except in those case where the spell have be previously determine by others that form of orthography have be employ which might be suppose most easily to convey their sound to a stranger in several work descriptive of the island in the pacific many of the most beautiful combination of vocal sound have be altogether lose to the ear of the reader by an over attention to the ordinary rule of spell there be a few passage in the ensue chapter which may be think to bear rather hard upon a reverend order of men the account of whose proceed in different quarter of the globe transmit to u through their own hand very generally and often very deservedly receive high commendation such passage will be find however to be base upon fact admit of no contradiction and which have come immediately under the writer ’ s cognizance the conclusion deduce from these fact be unavoidable and in state them the author have be influence by no feel of animosity either to the individual themselves or to that glorious cause which have not always be serve by the proceed of some of it advocate the great interest with which the important event lately occur at the sandwich marquesas and society island have be regard in america and england and indeed throughout the world will he trust justify a few otherwise unwarrantable digression there be some thing relate in the narrative which will be sure to appear strange or perhaps entirely incomprehensible to the reader but they can not appear more so to him than they do to the author at the time he have state such matter just a they occur and leave every one to form his own opinion concern them trust that his anxious desire to speak the unvarnished truth will gain for him the confidence of his reader introduction to the edition of by arthur stedman of the trinity of american author whose birth make the year a notable one in our literary history lowell whitman and melville it be interest to observe that the two latter be both descend on the father ’ and mother ’ side respectively from have family of british new england and dutch new york extraction whitman and van velsor melville and gansevoort be the several combination which produce these men and it be easy to trace in the life and character of each author the quality derive from his joint ancestry here however the resemblance cease for whitman ’ s forebear while worthy country people of good descent be not prominent in public or private life melville on the other hand be of distinctly patrician birth his paternal and maternal grandfather have be lead character in the revolutionary war their descendant still maintain a dignify social position allan melville great grandfather of herman melville remove from scotland to america in and establish himself a a merchant in boston his son major thomas melville be a leader in the famous ‘ boston tea party ’ of and afterwards become an officer in the continental army he be report to have be a conservative in all matter except his opposition to unjust taxation and he wear the old fashion cock hat and knee breech until his death in thus become the original of doctor holmes ’ s poem ‘ the last leaf ’ major melville ’ s son allan the father of herman be an import merchant first in boston and late in new york he be a man of much culture and be an extensive traveller for his time he marry maria gansevoort daughter of general peter gansevoort best know a ‘ the hero of fort stanwix ’ this fort be situate on the present site of rome n y and there gansevoort with a small body of men hold in check reinforcement on their way to join burgoyne until the disastrous ending of the latter ’ s campaign of be insure the gansevoorts it should be say be at that time and subsequently resident of albany n y herman melville be bear in new york on august and receive his early education in that city there he imbibe his first love of adventure listen a he say in ‘ redburn ’ while his father ‘ of winter evening by the well remember sea coal fire in old greenwich street use to tell my brother and me of the monstrous wave at sea mountain high of the mast bend like twig and all about havre and liverpool ’ the death of his father in reduce circumstance necessitate the removal of his mother and the family of eight brother and sister to the village of lansingburg on the hudson river there herman remain until when he attend the albany classical school for some month dr charles e west the well know brooklyn educator be then in charge of the school and remember the lad ’ s deftness in english composition and his struggle with mathematics the follow year be pass at pittsfield mass where he engage in work on his uncle ’ s farm long know a the ‘ van schaack place ’ this uncle be thomas melville president of the berkshire agricultural society and a successful gentleman farmer herman ’ s roving disposition and a desire to support himself independently of family assistance soon lead him to ship a cabin boy in a new york vessel bind for liverpool he make the voyage visit london and return in the same ship ‘ redburn his first voyage ’ publish in be partly found on the experience of this trip which be undertake with the full consent of his relative and which seem to have satisfy his nautical ambition for a time a tell in the book melville meet with more than the usual hardship of a sailor boy ’ s first venture it do not seem difficult in ‘ redburn ’ to separate the author ’ s actual experience from those invent by him this be the case in some of his other write a good part of the succeed three year from to be occupy with school teaching while so engage at greenbush now east albany n y he receive the munificent salary of ‘ six dollar a quarter and board ’ he teach for one term at pittsfield mass ‘ board around ’ with the family of his pupil in true american fashion and easily suppress on one memorable occasion the effort of his large scholar to inaugurate a rebellion by physical force i fancy that it be the read of richard henry dana ’ s ‘ two year before the mast ’ which revive the spirit of adventure in melville ’ s breast that book be publish in and be at once talk of everywhere melville must have read it at the time mindful of his own experience a a sailor at any rate he once more sign a ship ’ s article and on january sail from new bedford harbour in the whaler acushnet bind for the pacific ocean and the sperm fishery he have leave very little direct information a to the event of this eighteen month ’ cruise although his whale romance ‘ moby dick or the whale ’ probably give many picture of life on board the acushnet in the present volume he confine himself to a general account of the captain ’ s bad treatment of the crew and of his non fulfilment of agreement under these consideration melville decide to abandon the vessel on reach the marquesas island and the narrative of ‘ typee ’ begin at this point however he always recognise the immense influence the voyage have have upon his career and in regard to it result have say in ‘ moby dick ’ ‘ if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hush world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that on the whole a man might rather have do than to have leave undo then here i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whale for a whale ship be my yale college and my harvard ’ the record then of melville ’ s escape from the dolly otherwise the acushnet the sojourn of his companion toby and himself in the typee valley on the island of nukuheva toby ’ s mysterious disappearance and melville ’ s own escape be fully give in the succeed page and rash indeed would he be who would enter into a descriptive contest with these inimitable picture of aboriginal life in the ‘ happy valley ’ so great an interest have always centre in the character of toby whose actual existence have be question that i be glad to be able to declare him an authentic personage by name richard t greene he be enable to discover himself again to mr melville through the publication of the present volume and their acquaintance be renew last for quite a long period i have see his portrait a rare old daguerrotype and some of his letter to our author one of his child be name for the latter but mr melville lose trace of him in recent year with the author ’ s rescue from what dr t m coan have style his ‘ anxious paradise ’ ‘ typee ’ end and it sequel ‘ omoo ’ begin here again it seem wise to leave the remain adventure in the south sea to the reader ’ s own discovery simply state that after a sojourn at the society island melville ship for honolulu there he remain for four month employ a a clerk he join the crew of the american frigate unite state which reach boston stop on the way at one of the peruvian port in october of once more be a narrative of his experience to be preserve in ‘ white jacket or the world in a man of war ’ thus of melville ’ s four most important book three ‘ typee ’ ‘ omoo ’ and ‘ white jacket ’ be directly auto biographical and ‘ moby dick ’ be partially so while the less important ‘ redburn ’ be between the two class in this respect melville ’ s other prose work a will be show be with some exception unsuccessful effort at creative romance whether our author enter on his whale adventure in the south sea with a determination to make them available for literary purpose may never be certainly know there be no such elaborate announcement or advance preparation a in some late case i be incline to believe that the literary prospect be an after think and that this insure a freshness and enthusiasm

one small round strawberry mole upon the wan cheek of northwestern hill signal a a candle one spot of radiance where all else be shade fairy there think i some haunt ring where fairy dance time pass and the follow may after a gentle shower upon the mountain a little shower islanded in misty sea of sunshine such a distant shower and sometimes two and three and four of them all visible together in different part a i love to watch from the piazza instead of thunder storm a i use to which wrap old greylock like a sinai till one think swart moses must be climb among scathed hemlock there after i say that gentle shower i saw a rainbow rest it far end just where in autumn i have mark the mole fairy there think i remember that rainbow bring out the bloom and that if one can but get to the rainbow s end his fortune be make in a bag of gold yon rainbow s end would i be there think i and none the less i wish it for now first notice what seem some sort of glen or grotto in the mountain

cottage perhaps long vacant and dismantle but this very spring magically fit up and glaze again one noon in the same direction i mark over dim top of terrace foliage a broad gleam a of a silver buckler hold sunwards over some croucher s head which gleam experience in like case teach must come from a roof newly shingle this to me make pretty sure the recent occupancy of that far cot in fairy land day after day now full of interest in my discovery what time i could spare from read the midsummer s night dream and all about titania wishfully i gaze off towards the hill but in vain either troop of shadow an imperial guard with slow pace and solemn defile along the steep or rout by pursue light flee broadcast from east to west old war of lucifer and michael or the mountain though unvexed by these mirror sham fight in the sky have an atmosphere otherwise unfavorable for fairy view i be sorry the more so because i have to keep my chamber for some time after which chamber do not face those hill at length when pretty well again and sit out in the september morning upon the piazza and think to myself when just after a little flock of sheep the farmer s band child pass a nut and say how sweet a day it be after all but what their father call a weather breeder and indeed be become so sensitive through my illness a that i could not bear to look upon a chinese creeper of my adoption and which to my delight climb a post of the piazza have burst out in starry bloom but now if you remove the leave a little show million of strange cankerous worm which feed upon those blossom so share their bless hue a to make it unblessed evermore worm whose germ have doubtless lurk in the very bulb which so hopefully i have plant in this ingrate peevishness of my weary convalescence be i sit there when suddenly look off i saw the golden mountain window dazzle like a deep sea dolphin fairy there think i once more the queen of fairy at her fairy window at any rate some glad mountain

what road i do not know nor could any one inform me not even one edmund spenser who have be there so he write me far than that to reach fairy land it must be voyage to and with faith i take the fairy mountain s bear and the first fine day when strength permit get into my yawl high pommel leather one cast off the fast and away i sail free voyager a an autumn leaf early dawn and sallying westward i

love which have invariably secure their allegiance to the mother country whether it head chance to be a parliament protector or popish monarch till these evil time however such allegiance have be merely nominal and the colonist have rule themselves enjoy far more freedom than be even yet the privilege of the native subject of great britain at length a rumor reach our shore that the prince of orange have venture on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of civil and religious right and the salvation of new england it be but a doubtful whisper it might be false or the attempt might fail and in either case the man that stir against king james would lose his head still the intelligence produce a mark effect the people smile mysteriously in the street and throw bold glance at their oppressor while far and wide there be a subdue and silent agitation a if the slight signal would rouse the whole land from it sluggish despondency aware of their danger the ruler resolve to avert it by an impose display of strength and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsh measure one afternoon in april sir edmund andros and his favorite councillor be warm with wine assemble the red coat of the governor s guard and make their appearance in the street of boston the sun be near set when the march commence the roll of the drum at that unquiet crisis seem to go through the street less a the martial music of the soldier than a a muster call to the inhabitant themselves a multitude by various avenue assemble in king street which be destine to be the scene nearly a century afterward of another encounter between the troop of britain and a people struggle against her tyranny though more than sixty year have elapse since the pilgrim come this crowd of their descendant still show the strong and sombre feature of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency than on happy occasion there be the sober garb the general severity of mien the gloomy but undismayed expression the scriptural form of speech and the confidence in heaven s blessing on a righteous cause which would have mark a band of the original puritan when threaten by some peril of the wilderness indeed it be not yet time for the old spirit to be extinct since there be men in the street that day who have worship there beneath the tree before a house be rear to the god for whom they have become exile old soldier of the parliament be here too smile grimly at the think that their age arm might strike another blow against the house of stuart here also be the veteran of king philip s war who have burn village and slaughter young and old with pious fierceness while the godly soul throughout the land be help them with prayer several minister be scatter among the crowd which unlike all other mob regard them with such reverence a if there be sanctity in their very garment these holy men exert their influence to quiet the people but not to disperse them meantime the purpose of the governor in disturb the peace of the town at a period when the slight commotion might throw the country into a ferment be almost the universal subject of inquiry and variously explain satan will strike his master stroke presently cry some because he knoweth that his time be short all our godly pastor be to be drag to prison we shall see them at a smithfield fire in king street hereupon the people of each parish gather close round their minister who look calmly upward and assume a more apostolic dignity a well befit a candidate for the high honor of his profession a crown of martyrdom it be actually fancy at that period that new england might have a john rogers of her own to take the place of that worthy in the primer the pope of rome have give order for a new st bartholomew cry others we be to be massacre man and male child neither be this rumor wholly discredit although the wise class believe the governor s object somewhat less atrocious his predecessor under the old charter bradstreet a venerable companion of the first settler be know to be in town there be ground for conjecture that sir edmund andros intend at once to strike terror by a parade of military force and to confound the opposite faction by possess himself of their chief stand firm for the old charter governor shout the crowd seize upon the idea the good old governor bradstreet while this cry be at the loud the people be surprise by the well know figure of governor bradstreet himself a patriarch of nearly ninety who appear on the elevate step of a door and with characteristic mildness beseech them to submit to the constitute authority my child conclude this venerable person do nothing rashly cry not aloud but pray for the welfare of new england and expect patiently what the lord will do in this matter the event be soon to be decide all this time the roll of the drum have be approach through cornhill loud and deep till with reverberation from house to house and the regular tramp of martial footstep it burst into the street a double rank of soldier make their appearance occupy the whole breadth of the passage with shoulder matchlock and match burn so a to present a row of fire in the dusk their steady march be like the progress of a machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in it way next move slowly with a confuse clatter of hoof on the pavement ride a party of mount gentleman the central figure be sir edmund andros elderly but erect and soldier like those around him be his favorite councillor and the bitterest foe of new england at his right hand ride edward randolph our arch enemy that blast wretch a cotton mather call him who achieve the downfall of our ancient government and be follow with a sensible curse through life and to his grave on the other side be bullivant scatter jest and mockery a he ride along dudley come behind with a downcast look dread a well he might to meet the indignant gaze of the people who behold him their only countryman by birth among the oppressor of his native land the captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or three civil officer under the crown be also there but the figure which most attract the public eye and stir up the deep feel be the episcopal clergyman of king s chapel rid haughtily among the magistrate in his priestly vestment the fit representative of prelacy and persecution the union of church and state and all those abomination which have drive the puritan to the wilderness another guard of soldier in double rank bring up the rear the whole scene be a picture of the condition of new england and it moral the deformity of any government that do not grow out of the nature of thing and the character of the people on one side the religious multitude with their sad visage and dark attire and on the other the group of despotic ruler with the high churchman in the midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosom all magnificently clothe flush with wine proud of unjust authority and scoff at the universal groan and the mercenary soldier wait but the word to deluge the street with blood show the only mean by which obedience could be secure o lord of host cry a voice among the crowd provide a champion for thy people this ejaculation be loudly utter and serve a a herald s cry to introduce a remarkable personage the crowd have roll back and be now huddle together nearly at the extremity of the street while the soldier have advance no more than a third of it length the intervene space be empty a pave solitude between lofty edifice which throw almost a twilight shadow over it suddenly there be see the figure of an ancient man who seem to have emerge from among the people and be walk by himself along the centre of the street to confront the armed band he wear the old puritan dress a dark cloak and a steeple crown hat in the fashion of at least fifty year before with a heavy sword upon his thigh but a staff in his hand to assist the tremulous gait of age when at some distance from the multitude the old man turn slowly round display a face of antique majesty render doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descend on his breast he make a gesture at once of encouragement and warn then turn again and resume his way who be this gray patriarch ask the young men of their sire who be this venerable brother ask the old men among themselves but none could make reply the father of the people those of fourscore year and upward be disturb deem it strange that they should forget one of such evident authority whom they must have know in their early day the associate of winthrop and all the old councillor give law and make prayer and lead them against the savage the elderly men ought to have remember him too with lock a gray in their youth a their own be now and the young how could he have pass so utterly from their memory that hoary sire the relic of long depart time whose awful benediction have surely be bestow on their uncover head in childhood whence do he come what be his purpose who can this old man be whisper the wonder crowd meanwhile the venerable stranger staff in hand be pursue his solitary walk along the centre of the street a he draw near the advance soldier and a the roll of their drum come full upon his ear the old man raise himself to a loftier mien while the decrepitude of age seem to fall from his shoulder leave him in gray but unbroken dignity now he march onward with a warrior s step keep time to the military music thus the age form advance on one side and the whole parade of soldier and magistrate on the other till when scarcely twenty yard remain between the old man grasp his staff by the middle and hold it before him like a leader s truncheon stand cry he the eye the face and attitude of command the solemn yet warlike peal of that voice fit either to rule a host in the battle field or be raise to god in prayer be irresistible at the old man s word and outstretched arm the roll of the drum be hush at once and the advance line stand still a tremulous enthusiasm seize upon the multitude that stately form combine the leader and the saint so gray so dimly see in such an ancient garb could only belong to some old champion of the righteous cause whom the oppressor s drum have summon from his grave they raise a shout of awe and exultation and look for the deliverance of new england the governor and the gentleman of his party perceive themselves bring to an unexpected stand ride hastily forward a if they would have press their snort and affright horse right against the hoary apparition he however blench not a step but glance his severe eye round the group which half encompass him at last bend it sternly on sir edmund andros one would have think that the dark old man be chief ruler there and that the governor and council with soldier at their back represent the whole power and authority of the crown have no alternative but obedience what do this old fellow here cry edward randolph fiercely on sir edmund bid the soldier forward and give the dotard the same choice that you give all his countryman to stand aside or be trample on nay nay let u show respect to the good grandsire say bullivant laugh see you not he be some old round head dignitary who hath lie asleep these thirty year and know nothing of the change of time doubtless he think to put u down with a proclamation in old noll s name be you mad old man demand sir edmund andros in loud and harsh tone how dare you stay the march of king james s governor i have stay the march of a king himself ere now reply the gray figure with stern composure i be here sir governor because the cry of an oppress people hath disturb me in my secret place and beseech this favor earnestly of the lord it be vouchsafe me to appear once again on earth in the good old cause of his saint and what speak ye of james there be no long a popish tyrant on the throne of england and by to morrow noon his name shall be a by word in this very street where ye would make it a word of terror back thou that wast a governor back with this night thy power be end to morrow the prison back lest i foretell the scaffold the people have be draw near and near and drink in the word of their champion who speak in accent long disused like one unaccustomed to converse except with the dead of many year ago but his voice stir their soul they confront the soldier not wholly without arm and ready to convert the very stone of the street into deadly weapon sir edmund andros look at the old man then he cast his hard and cruel eye over the multitude and behold them burn with that lurid wrath so difficult to kindle or to quench and again he fix his gaze on the age form which stand obscurely in an open space where neither friend nor foe have thrust himself what be his thought he utter no word which might discover but whether the oppressor be overawe by the gray champion s look or perceive his peril in the threaten attitude of the people it be certain that he give back and order his soldier to commence a slow and guard retreat before another sunset the governor and all that ride so proudly with him be prisoner and long ere it be know that james have abdicate king william be proclaim throughout new england but where be the gray champion some report that when the troop have go from king street and the people be throng tumultuously in their rear bradstreet the age governor be see to embrace a form more age than his own others soberly affirm that while they marvel at the venerable grandeur of his aspect the old man have fade from their eye melt slowly into the hue of twilight till where he stand there be an empty space but all agree that the hoary shape be go the men of that generation watch for his reappearance in sunshine and in twilight but never saw him more nor know when his funeral pass nor where his gravestone be and who be the gray champion perhaps his name might be find in the record of that stern court of justice which pass a sentence too mighty for the age but glorious in all after time for it humble lesson to the monarch and it high example to the subject i have hear that whenever the descendant of the puritan be to show the spirit of their sire the old man appear again when eighty year have pass he walk once more in king street five year late in the twilight of an april morning he stand on the green beside the meet house at lexington where now the obelisk of granite with

overmuch of myself and my affair at the fireside and to my personal friend an autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have take possession of me in address the public the first time be three or four year since when i favour the reader inexcusably and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an old manse and now because beyond my desert i be happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion i again seize the public by the button and talk of my three year experience in a custom house the example of the famous p p clerk of this parish be never more faithfully follow the truth seem to be however that when he cast his leave forth upon the wind the author address not the many who will fling aside his volume or never take it up but the few who will understand him well than most of his schoolmate or lifemates some author indeed do far more than this and indulge themselves in such confidential depth of revelation a could fittingly be address only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy a if the print book throw at large on the wide world be certain to find out the divide segment of the writer s own nature and complete his circle of existence by bring him into communion with it it be scarcely decorous however to speak all even where we speak impersonally but a thought be freeze and utterance benumb unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend a kind and apprehensive though not the close friend be listen to our talk and then a native reserve be thaw by this genial consciousness we may prate of the circumstance that lie around u and even of ourself but still keep the inmost me behind it veil to this extent and within these limit an author methinks may be autobiographical without violate either the reader s right or his own it will be see likewise that this custom house sketch have a certain propriety of a kind always recognise in literature a explain how a large portion of the follow page come into my possession and a offer proof of the authenticity of a narrative therein contain this in fact a desire to put myself in my true position a editor or very little more of the most prolix among the tale that make up my volume this and no other be my true reason for assume a personal relation with the public in accomplish the main purpose it have appear allowable by a few extra touch to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore describe together with some of the character that move in it among whom the author happen to make one in my native town of salem at the head of what half a century ago in the day of old king derby be a bustle wharf but which be now burden with decay wooden warehouse and exhibit few or no symptom of commercial life except perhaps a bark or brig half way down it melancholy length discharge hide or near at hand a nova scotia schooner pitch out her cargo of firewood at the head i say of this dilapidate wharf which the tide often overflow and along which at the base and in the rear of the row of build the track of many languid year be see in a border of unthrifty grass here with a view from it front window adown this not very enliven prospect and thence across the harbour stand a spacious edifice of brick from the loftiest point of it roof during precisely three and a half hour of each forenoon float or droop in breeze or calm the banner of the republic but with the thirteen strip turn vertically instead of horizontally and thus indicate that a civil and not a military post of uncle sam s government be here establish it front be ornament with a portico of half a dozen wooden pillar support a balcony beneath which a flight of wide granite step descend towards the street over the entrance hover an enormous specimen of the american eagle with outspread wing a shield before her breast and if i recollect aright a bunch of intermingle thunderbolt and barb arrow in each claw with the customary infirmity of temper that characterize this unhappy fowl she appear by the fierceness of her beak and eye and the general truculency of her attitude to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community and especially to warn all citizen careful of their safety against intrude on the premise which she overshadow with her wing nevertheless vixenly a she look many people be seek at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle imagine i presume that her bosom have all the softness and snugness of an eiderdown pillow but she have no great tenderness even in her best of mood and sooner or late oftener soon than late be apt to fling off her nestle with a scratch of her claw a dab of her beak or a rankle wind from her barb arrow the pavement round about the above describe edifice which we may a well name at once a the custom house of the port have grass enough grow in it chink to show that it have not of late day be wear by any multitudinous resort of business in some month of the year however there often chance a forenoon when affair move onward with a lively tread such occasion might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with england when salem be a port by itself not scorn a she be now by her own merchant and ship owner who permit her wharf to crumble to ruin while their venture go to swell needlessly and imperceptibly the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston on some such morning when three or four vessel happen to have arrive at once usually from africa or south america or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward there be a sound of frequent foot pass briskly up and down the granite step here before his own wife have greet him you may greet the sea flush ship master just in port with his vessel s paper under his arm in a tarnish tin box here too come his owner cheerful sombre gracious or in the sulk accordingly a his scheme of the now accomplish voyage have be realize in merchandise that will readily be turn to gold or have bury him under a bulk of incommodities such a nobody will care to rid him of here likewise the germ of the wrinkle browed grizzly beard careworn merchant we have the smart young clerk who get the taste of traffic a a wolf cub do of blood and already send adventure in his master s ship when he have well be sailing mimic boat upon a mill pond another figure in the scene be the outward bind sailor in quest of a protection or the recently arrive one pale and feeble seek a passport to the hospital nor must we forget the captain of the rusty little schooner that bring firewood from the british province a rough look set of tarpaulin without the alertness of the yankee aspect but contribute an item of no slight importance to our decay trade cluster all these individual together a they sometimes be with other miscellaneous one to diversify the group and for the time be it make the custom house a stir scene more frequently however on ascend the step you would discern in the entry if it be summer time or in their appropriate room if wintry or inclement weather a row of venerable figure sit in old fashion chair which be tip on their hind leg back against the wall oftentimes they be asleep but occasionally might be hear talk together in voice between a speech and a snore and with that lack of energy that distinguish the occupant of alms house and all other human be who depend for subsistence on charity on monopolize labour or anything else but their own independent exertion these old gentleman seat like matthew at the receipt of custom but not very liable to be summon thence like him for apostolic errand be custom house officer furthermore on the leave hand a you enter the front door be a certain room or office about fifteen foot square and of a lofty height with two of it arch window command a view of the aforesaid dilapidate wharf and the third look across a narrow lane and along a portion of derby street all three give glimpse of the shop of grocer block maker slop seller and ship chandler around the door of which be generally to be see laugh and gossip cluster of old salt and such other wharf rat a haunt the wapping of a seaport the room itself be cobwebbed and dingy with old paint it floor be strew with grey sand in a fashion that have elsewhere fall into long disuse and it be easy to conclude from the general slovenliness of the place that this be a sanctuary into which womankind with her tool of magic the broom and mop have very infrequent access in the way of furniture there be a stove with a voluminous funnel an old pine desk with a three legged stool beside it two or three wooden bottom chair exceedingly decrepit and infirm and not to forget the library on some shelf a score or two of volume of the act of congress and a bulky digest of the revenue law a tin pipe ascend through the ceiling and form a medium of vocal communication with other part of the edifice and here some six month ago pace from corner to corner or lounge on the long legged stool with his elbow on the desk and his eye wander up and down the column of the morning newspaper you might have recognise honour reader the same individual who welcome you into his cheery little study where the sunshine glimmer so pleasantly through the willow branch on the western side of the old manse but now should you go thither to seek him you would inquire in vain for the locofoco surveyor the besom of reform hath sweep him out of office and a worthy successor wear his dignity and pocket his emolument this old town of salem my native place though i have dwell much away from it both in boyhood and mature year possess or do possess a hold on my affection the force of which i have never realize during my season of actual residence here indeed so far a it physical aspect be concern with it flat unvaried surface cover chiefly with wooden house few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty it irregularity which be neither picturesque nor quaint but only tame it long and lazy street lounge wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula with gallows hill and new guinea at one end and a view of the alms house at the other such be the feature of my native town it would be quite a reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarrange checker board and yet though invariably happy elsewhere there be within me a feel for old salem which in lack of a well phrase i must be content to call affection the sentiment be probably assignable to the deep and age root which my family have stick into the soil it be now nearly two century and a quarter since the original briton the early emigrant of my name make his appearance in the wild and forest border settlement which have since become a city and here his descendant have be bear and die and have mingle their earthly substance with the soil until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith for a little while i walk the street in part therefore the attachment which i speak of be the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust few of my countryman can know what it be nor a frequent transplantation be perhaps well for the stock need they consider it desirable to know but the sentiment have likewise it moral quality the figure of that first ancestor invest by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur be present to my boyish imagination a far back a i can remember it still haunt me and induce a sort of home feel with the past which i scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town i seem to have a strong claim to a residence here on account of this grave beard sable cloak and steeple crown progenitor who come so early with his bible and his sword and trode the unworn street with such a stately port and make so large a figure a a man of war and peace a strong claim than for myself whose name be seldom hear and my face hardly know he be a soldier legislator judge he be a ruler in the church he have all the puritanic trait both good and evil he be likewise a bitter persecutor a witness the quaker who have remember him in their history and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect which will last long it be to be fear than any record of his well deed although these be many his son too inherit the persecute spirit and make himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witch that their blood may fairly be say to have leave a stain upon him so deep a stain indeed that his dry old bone in the charter street burial grind must still retain it if they have not crumble utterly to dust i know not whether these ancestor of mine bethink themselves to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelty or whether they be now groan under the heavy consequence of them in another state of be at all event i the present writer a their representative hereby take shame upon myself for their sake and pray that any curse incur by them a i have hear and a the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race for many a long year back would argue to exist may be now and henceforth remove doubtless however either of these stern and black browed puritan would have think it quite a sufficient retribution for his sin that after so long a lapse of year the old trunk of the family tree with so much venerable moss upon it should have bear a it topmost bough an idler like myself no aim that i have ever cherish would they recognise a laudable no success of mine if my life beyond it domestic scope have ever be brighten by success would they deem otherwise than worthless if not positively disgraceful what be he murmur one grey shadow of my forefather to the other a writer of story book what kind of business in life what mode of glorify god or be serviceable to mankind in his day and generation may that be why the degenerate fellow might a well have be a fiddler such be the compliment bandy between my great grandsires and myself across the gulf of time and yet let them scorn me a

the stockbridge bowl i sha n t have the new story ready by november he explain to his publisher on the st of october for i be never good for anything in the literary way till after the first autumnal frost which have somewhat such an effect on my imagination that it do on the foliage here about me multiply and brighten it hue but by vigorous application he be able to complete the new work about the middle of the january follow since research have disclose the manner in which the romance be interweave with incident from the history of the hawthorne family the house of the seven gable have acquire an interest apart from that by which it first appeal to the public john hathorne a the name be then spell the great grandfather of nathaniel hawthorne be a magistrate at salem in the latter part of the seventeenth century and officiate at the famous trial for witchcraft hold there it be of record that he use peculiar severity towards a certain woman who be among the accuse and the husband of this woman prophesy that god would take revenge upon his wife s persecutor this circumstance doubtless furnish a hint for that piece of tradition in the book which represent a pyncheon of a former generation a have persecute one maule who declare that god would give his enemy blood to drink it become a conviction with the hawthorne family that a curse have be pronounce upon it member which continue in force in the time of the romance a conviction perhaps derive from the record prophecy of the injure woman s husband just mention and here again we have a correspondence with maule s malediction in the story furthermore there occur in the american note book august a reminiscence of the author s family to the follow effect philip english a character well know in early salem annals be among those who suffer from john hathorne s magisterial harshness and he maintain in consequence a last feud with the old puritan official but at his death english leave daughter one of whom be say to have marry the son of justice john hathorne whom english have declare he would never forgive it be scarcely necessary to point out how clearly this foreshadow the final union of those hereditary foe the pyncheons and maul through the marriage of phoebe and holgrave the romance however describe the maul a possess some of the trait know to have be characteristic of the hawthorne for example so long a any of the race be to be find they have be mark out from other men not strikingly nor a with a sharp line but with an effect that be felt rather than speak of by an hereditary characteristic of reserve thus while the general suggestion of the hawthorne line and it fortune be follow in the romance the pyncheons take the place of the author s family certain distinguish mark of the hawthorne be assign to the imaginary maule posterity there be one or two other point which indicate hawthorne s method of base his composition the result in the main of pure invention on the solid grind of particular fact allusion be make in the first chapter of the seven gable to a grant of land in waldo county maine own by the pyncheon family in the american note book there be an entry date august which speak of the revolutionary general knox and his land grant in waldo county by virtue of which the owner have hop to establish an estate on the english plan with a tenantry to make it profitable for him an incident of much great importance in the story be the suppose murder of one of the pyncheons by his nephew to whom we be introduce a clifford pyncheon in all probability hawthorne connect with this in his mind the murder of mr white a wealthy gentleman of salem kill by a man whom his nephew have hire this take place a few year after hawthorne s graduation from college and be one of the celebrate case of the day daniel webster take part prominently in the trial but it should be observe here that such resemblance a these between sundry element in the work of hawthorne s fancy and detail of reality be only fragmentary and be rearrange to suit the author s purpose in the same way he have make his description of hepzibah pyncheon s seven gabled mansion conform so nearly to several old dwell formerly or still extant in salem that strenuous effort have be make to fix upon some one of them a the veritable edifice of the romance a paragraph in the opening chapter have perhaps assist this delusion that there must have be a single original house of the seven gable frame by flesh and blood carpenter for it run thus familiar a it stand in the writer s recollection for it have be an object of curiosity with him from boyhood both a a specimen of the best and stateliest architecture of a long past epoch and a the scene of event more full of interest perhaps than those of a gray feudal castle familiar a it stand in it rusty old age it be therefore only the more difficult to imagine the bright novelty with which it first catch the sunshine hundred of pilgrim annually visit a house in salem belong to one branch of the ingersoll family of that place which be stoutly maintain to have be the model for hawthorne s visionary dwell others have suppose that the now vanish house of the identical philip english whose blood a we have already notice become mingle with that of the hawthorne supply the pattern and still a third build know a the curwen mansion have be declare the only genuine establishment notwithstanding persistent popular belief the authenticity of all these must positively be deny although it be possible that isolate reminiscence of all three may have blend with the ideal image in the mind of hawthorne he it will be see remark in the preface allude to himself in the third person that he trust not to be condemn for lay out a street that infringe upon nobody s private right and build a house of material long in use for construct castle in the air more than this he state to person still live that the house of the romance be not copy from any actual edifice but be simply a general reproduction of a style of architecture belong to colonial day example of which survive into the period of his youth but have since be radically modify or destroy here a elsewhere he exercise the liberty of a creative mind to heighten the probability of his picture without confine himself to a literal description of something he have see while hawthorne remain at lenox and during the composition of this romance various other literary personage settle or stay for a time in the vicinity among them herman melville whose intercourse hawthorne greatly enjoy henry james sr doctor holmes j t headley james russell lowell edwin p whipple frederika bremer and j t field so that there be no lack of intellectual society in the midst of the beautiful and inspire mountain scenery of the place in the afternoon nowadays he record shortly before begin the work this valley in which i dwell seem like a vast basin fill with golden sunshine a with wine and happy in the companionship of his wife and their three child he lead a simple refine idyllic life despite the restriction of a scanty and uncertain income a letter write by mr hawthorne at this time to a member of her family give incidentally a glimpse of the scene which may properly find a place here she say i delight to think that you also can look forth a i do now upon a broad valley and a fine amphitheater of hill and be about to watch the stately ceremony of the sunset from your piazza but you have not this lovely lake nor i suppose the delicate purple mist which fold these slumber mountain in airy veil mr hawthorne have be lie down in the sun shine slightly fleckered with the shadow of a tree and una and julian have be make him look like the mighty pan by cover his chin and breast with long grass blade that look like a verdant and venerable beard the pleasantness and peace of his surround and of his modest home in lenox may be take into account a harmonize with the mellow serenity of the romance then produce of the work when it appear in the early spring of he write to horatio bridge these word now publish for the first time the house of the seven gable in my opinion be well than the scarlet letter but i should not wonder if i have refine upon the principal character a little too much for popular appreciation nor if the romance of the book should be somewhat at odds with the humble and familiar scenery in which i invest it but i feel that portion of it be a good a anything i can hope to write and the publisher speak encouragingly of it success from england especially come many warm expression of praise a fact which mr hawthorne in a private letter comment on a the fulfillment of a possibility which hawthorne write in boyhood to his mother have look forward to he have ask her if she would not like him to become an author and have his book read in england g p l preface when a writer call his work a romance it need hardly be observe that he wish to claim a certain latitude both a to it fashion and material which he would not have felt himself entitle to assume have he profess to be write a novel the latter form of composition be presume to aim at a very minute fidelity not merely to the possible but to the probable and ordinary course of man s experience the former while a a work of art it must rigidly subject itself to law and while it sin unpardonably so far a it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart have fairly a right to present that truth under circumstance to a great extent of the writer s own choose or creation if he think fit also he may so manage his atmospherical medium a to bring out or mellow the light and deepen and enrich the shadow of the picture he will be wise no doubt to make a very moderate use of the privilege here state and especially to mingle the marvelous rather a a slight delicate and evanescent flavor than a any portion of the actual substance of the dish offer to the public he can hardly be say however to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this caution in the present work the author have propose to himself but with what success fortunately it be not for him to judge to keep undeviatingly within his immunity the point of view in which this tale come under the romantic definition lie in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that be flit away from u it be a legend prolong itself from an epoch now gray in the distance down into our own broad daylight and bring along with it some of it legendary mist which the reader accord to his pleasure may either disregard or allow it to float almost imperceptibly about the character and event for the sake of a picturesque effect the narrative it may be be weave of so humble a texture a to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment many writer lay very great stress upon some definite moral purpose at which they profess to aim their work not to be deficient in this particular the author have provide himself with a moral the truth namely that the wrong do of one generation life into the successive one and divest itself of every temporary advantage become a pure and uncontrollable mischief and he would feel it a singular gratification if this romance might effectually convince mankind or indeed any one man of the folly of tumble down an avalanche of ill get gold or real estate on the head of an unfortunate posterity thereby to maim and crush them until the accumulate mass shall be scatter abroad in it original atom in good faith however he be not sufficiently imaginative to flat himself with the slight hope of this kind when romance do really teach anything or produce any effective operation it be usually through a far more subtile process than the ostensible one the author have consider it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with it moral a with an iron rod or rather a by stick a pin through a butterfly thus at once deprive it of life and cause it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude a high truth indeed fairly finely and skilfully work out brighten at every step and crown the final development of a work of fiction may add an artistic glory but be never any true and seldom any more evident at the last page than at the first the reader may perhaps choose to assign an actual locality to the imaginary event of this narrative if permit by the historical connection which though slight be essential to his plan the author would very willingly have avoid anything of this nature not to speak of other objection it expose the romance to an inflexible and exceedingly dangerous specie of criticism by bring his fancy picture almost into positive contact with the reality of the moment it have be no part of his object however to describe local manner nor in any way to meddle with the characteristic of a community for whom he cherish a proper respect and a natural regard he trust not to be consider a unpardonably offend by lay out a street that infringe upon nobody s private right and appropriate a lot of land which have no visible owner and build a house of material long in use for construct castle in the air the personage of the tale though they give themselves out to be of ancient stability and considerable prominence be really of the author s own make or at all event of his own mix their virtue can shed no lustre nor their defect redound in the remote degree to the discredit of the venerable town of which they profess to be inhabitant he would be glad therefore if especially in the quarter to which he allude the book may be read strictly a a romance have a great deal more to do with the cloud overhead than with any portion of the actual soil of the county of essex lenox january the house of seven gable by nathaniel hawthorne i the old pyncheon family halfway down a by street of one of our new england town stand a rusty wooden house with seven acutely peak gable face towards various point of the compass and a huge cluster chimney in the midst the street be pyncheon street the house be the old pyncheon house and an elm tree of wide circumference root before the door be familiar to every town bear child by the title of the pyncheon elm on my occasional visit to the town aforesaid i seldom fail to turn down pyncheon street for the sake of pass through the shadow of these two antiquity the great elm tree and the weather beat edifice the aspect of the venerable mansion have always affect me like a human countenance bear the trace not merely of outward storm and sunshine but expressive also of the long lapse of mortal life and accompany vicissitude that have pass within be these to be worthily recount they would form a narrative of no small interest and instruction and possess moreover a certain remarkable unity which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement but the story would include a chain of event extend over the well part of two century and write out with reasonable amplitude would fill a big folio volume or a long series of duodecimos than could prudently be appropriate to the annals of all new england during a similar period it consequently become imperative to make short work with most of the traditionary lore of which the old pyncheon house otherwise know a the house of the seven

the region of miracle it be not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in it depth and absorb energy the high intellect the imagination the spirit and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuit which a some of their ardent votary believe would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new world for himself we know not whether aylmer possess this degree of faith in man s ultimate control over nature he have devote himself however too unreservedly to scientific study ever to be wean from them by any second passion his love for his young wife might prove the strong of the two but it could only be by intertwine itself with his love of science and

the small pygmy size georgiana s lover be wont to say that some fairy at her birth hour have lay her tiny hand upon the infant s cheek and leave this impress there in token of the magic endowment that be to give her such sway over all heart many a desperate swain would have risk life for the privilege of press his lip to the mysterious hand it must not be conceal however that the impression work by this fairy sign manual vary exceedingly accord to the difference of temperament in the beholder some fastidious person but they be exclusively of her own sex affirm that the bloody hand a they choose to call it quite destroy the effect of georgiana s beauty and render her countenance even hideous but it would be a reasonable to say that one of those small blue stain which sometimes occur in the pure statuary marble would convert the eve of power to a monster masculine observer if the birthmark do not heighten their admiration content themselves with wish it away that the world might possess one live specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a flaw after his marriage for he think little or nothing of the matter before aylmer discover that this be the case with himself have she be less beautiful if envy s self could have find aught else to sneer at he might have felt his affection heighten by the prettiness of this mimic hand now vaguely portray now lose now steal forth

their unite life it be the fatal flaw of humanity which nature in one shape or another stamp ineffaceably on all her production either to imply that they be temporary and finite or that their perfection must be work by toil and pain the crimson hand express the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutch the high and pure of earthly mould degrade them into kindred with the low and even with

he invariably and without intend it nay in spite of a purpose to the contrary revert to this one disastrous topic trifle a it at first appear it so connect itself with innumerable train of think and mode of feel that it become the central point of all with the morning twilight aylmer open his eye upon his wife s face and recognize the symbol of imperfection and when they sit together at the evening hearth his eye wander stealthily to her cheek and behold flicker with the blaze of the wood fire the spectral hand that write mortality where he would fain have worship georgiana soon learn to shudder at his gaze it need but a glance with the peculiar expression that his face often wear to change the rose of her cheek into a deathlike paleness amid which the crimson hand be bring strongly out like a bass relief of ruby on the white marble late one night when the light be grow dim so a hardly to betray the stain on the poor wife s cheek she herself for the first time voluntarily take up the subject do you remember my dear aylmer say she with a feeble attempt at a smile have you any recollection of a dream last night about this odious hand none none whatever reply aylmer start but then he add in a dry cold tone affect for the sake of conceal the real depth of his emotion i might well dream of it for before i fell asleep it have take a pretty firm hold of my fancy and you do dream of it continue georgiana hastily for she dread lest a gush of tear should interrupt what she have to say a terrible dream i wonder that you can forget it be it possible to forget this one

do we know that there be a possibility on any term of unclasp the firm gripe of this little hand which be lay upon me before i come into the world dearest georgiana i have spend much think upon the

which might almost have enlighten me to create a be less perfect than yourself georgiana you have lead me deep than ever into the heart of science i feel myself fully competent to render this dear cheek a faultless a it fellow and then most beloved what will be my triumph when i shall have correct what nature leave imperfect in her fair work even pygmalion when his sculpture woman assume life felt not great ecstasy than mine will be it be resolve then say georgiana faintly smile and aylmer spare me not though you should find the birthmark take refuge in my heart at last her husband tenderly kiss her cheek her right cheek not that which bore the impress of the crimson hand the next day aylmer apprise his wife of a plan that he have form whereby he might have opportunity for the intense think and constant watchfulness which the propose operation would require while georgiana likewise would enjoy the perfect repose essential to it success they be to seclude themselves in the extensive apartment occupy by aylmer a a laboratory and where during his toilsome youth he have make discovery in the elemental power of nature that have rouse the admiration of all the learn society in europe seat calmly in this laboratory the pale philosopher have investigate the secret of the high cloud region and of the profound mine he have satisfy himself of the cause that kindle and keep alive the fire of the volcano and have explain the mystery of fountain and how it be that they gush forth some so bright and pure and others with such rich medicinal virtue from the dark bosom of the earth here too at an early period he have study the wonder of the human frame and attempt to fathom the very process by which nature assimilate all her precious influence from earth and air and from the spiritual world to create and foster man her masterpiece the latter pursuit however aylmer have long lay aside in unwilling recognition of the truth against which all seeker sooner or late stumble that our great creative mother while she amuse u with apparently work in the broad sunshine be yet severely careful to keep her own secret and in spite of her pretend openness show u nothing but result she permit u indeed to mar but seldom to mend and like a jealous patentee on no account to make now however aylmer resume these half forget investigation not of course with such hop or wish a first suggest them but because they involve much physiological truth and lay in the path of his propose scheme for the treatment of georgiana a he lead her over the threshold of the laboratory georgiana be cold and tremulous aylmer look cheerfully into her face with intent to reassure her but be so startle with the intense glow of the birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a strong convulsive shudder his wife faint aminadab aminadab shout aylmer stamp violently on the floor forthwith there issue from an inner apartment a man of low stature but bulky frame with shaggy hair hang about his visage which be grime with the vapor of the furnace this personage have be aylmer s underworker during his whole scientific career and be admirably fit for that office by his great mechanical readiness and the skill with which while incapable of comprehend a single principle he execute all the detail of his master s experiment with his vast strength his shaggy hair

spiritual element throw open the door of the boudoir aminadab say aylmer and burn a pastil yes master answer aminadab look intently at the lifeless form of georgiana and then he mutter to himself if she be my wife i d never part with that birthmark when georgiana recover consciousness she find herself breathe an atmosphere of penetrate fragrance the gentle potency of which have recall her from her deathlike faintness the scene around her look like enchantment aylmer have convert those smoky dingy sombre room where he have spend his bright year in recondite pursuit into a series of beautiful apartment not unfit to be the seclude abode of a lovely woman the wall be hang with gorgeous curtain which impart the combination of grandeur and grace that no other specie of adornment can achieve and a they fell from the ceiling to the floor their rich and ponderous fold conceal all angle and straight line appear to shut in the scene from infinite space for aught georgiana know it might be a pavilion among the cloud and aylmer exclude the sunshine which would have interfere with his chemical process have supply it place with perfume lamp emit flame of various hue but all unite in a soft impurpled radiance he now kneel by his wife s side watch her earnestly but without alarm for he be confident in his science and felt that he could draw a magic circle round her within which no evil might intrude where be i ah i remember say georgiana faintly and she place her hand over her cheek to hide the terrible mark from her husband s eye fear not dearest exclaim he do not shrink from me believe me georgiana i even rejoice in this single imperfection since it will be such a rapture to remove it oh spare me sadly reply his wife pray do not look at it again i never can forget that convulsive shudder in order to soothe georgiana and a it be to release her mind from the burden of actual thing aylmer now put in practice some of the light and playful secret which science have teach him among it profound lore airy figure absolutely bodiless idea and form of unsubstantial beauty come and dance before her imprint their momentary footstep on beam of light though she have some indistinct idea of the method of these optical phenomenon still the illusion be almost perfect enough to warrant the belief that her husband possess sway over the spiritual world then again when she felt a wish to look forth from her seclusion immediately a if her thought be answer the procession of external existence flit across a screen the scenery and the figure of actual life be perfectly represent but with that bewitch yet indescribable difference which always make a picture an image or a shadow so much more attractive than the original when weary of this aylmer bid her cast her eye

both freakish and obstinate and he have now take some notion or other into his head that make him hesitate in his former design i wonder sir say he whether you know a lady whom they call zenobia not personally i answer although i expect that pleasure to morrow a she have get the start of the rest of u and be already a resident at blithedale but have you a literary turn mr moodie or have you take up the advocacy of woman s right or what else can have interest you in this lady zenobia by the bye a i suppose you know be merely her public name a sort of mask in which she come before the world retain all the privilege of privacy a contrivance in short like the white drapery of the veil lady only a little more transparent but it be late will you tell me what i can do for you please to excuse me to night mr coverdale say moodie you be very kind but i be afraid i have trouble you when after all there may be no need perhaps with your good leave i will come to your lodging to morrow morning before you set out for blithedale i wish you a good night sir and beg pardon for stop you and so he slipt away and a he do not show himself the next morning it be only through subsequent event that i ever arrive at a plausible conjecture a to what his business could have be arrive at my room i throw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate light a cigar and spend an hour in musing of every hue from the bright to the most sombre be in truth not so very confident a at some former period that this final step which would mix me up irrevocably with the blithedale affair be the wise that could possibly be take it be nothing short of midnight when i go to bed after drink a glass of particularly fine sherry on which i use to pride myself in those day it be the very last bottle and i finish it with a friend the next forenoon before set out for blithedale ii blithedale there can hardly remain for me who be really get to be a frosty bachelor with another white hair every week or so in my mustache there can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth a that which i remember the next day at blithedale it be a wood fire in the parlor of an old farmhouse on an april afternoon but with the fitful gust of a wintry snowstorm roar in the chimney vividly do that fireside re create itself a i rake away the ash from the ember in my memory and blow them up with a sigh for lack of more inspire breath vividly for an instant but anon with the dim gleam and with just a little fervency for my heart a for my finger end the staunch oaken log be long ago burn out their genial glow must be represent if at all by the merest phosphoric glimmer like that which exude rather than shin from damp fragment of decay tree delude the benight wanderer through a forest around such chill mockery of a fire some few of u might sit on the wither leave spread out each a palm towards the imaginary warmth and talk over our explode scheme for begin the life of paradise anew paradise indeed nobody else in the world i be bold to affirm nobody at least in our bleak little world of new england have dream of paradise that day except a the pole suggest the tropic nor with such material a be at hand could the most skilful architect have construct any well imitation of eve s bower than might be see in the snow hut of an esquimaux but we make a summer of it in spite of the wild drift it be an april day a already hint and well towards the middle of the month when morning dawn upon me in town it temperature be mild enough to be pronounce even balmy by a lodger like myself in one of the midmost house of a brick block each house partake of the warmth of all the rest besides the sultriness of it individual furnace heat but towards noon there have come snow drive along the street by a northeasterly blast and whitening the roof and sidewalk with a business like perseverance that would have do credit to our severest january tempest it set about it task apparently a much in earnest a if it have be guarantee from a thaw for month to come the great surely be my heroism when puff out a final whiff of cigar smoke i quit my cosey pair of bachelor room with a good fire burn in the grate and a closet right at hand where there be still a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret in a box quit i say these comfortable quarter and plunge into the heart of the pitiless snowstorm in quest of a well life the well life possibly it would hardly look so now it be enough if it look so then the greatest obstacle to be heroic be the doubt whether one may not be go to prove one s self a fool the true heroism be to resist the doubt and the profound wisdom to know when it ought to be resist and when to be obey yet after all let u acknowledge it wise if not more sagacious to follow out one s daydream to it natural consummation although if the vision have be worth the have it be certain never to be consummate otherwise than by a failure and what of that it airiest fragment impalpable a they may be will possess a value that lurk not in the most ponderous reality of any practicable scheme they be not the rubbish of the mind whatever else i may repent of therefore let it be reckon neither among my sin nor folly that i once have faith and force enough to form generous hop of the world s destiny yes and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment even to the extent of quit a warm fireside fling away a freshly light cigar and travel far beyond the strike of city clock through a drift snowstorm there be four of u who ride together through the storm and hollingsworth who have agree to be of the number be accidentally delay and set forth at a late hour alone a we thread the street i remember how the build on either side seem to press too closely

and alight on the sidewalk only to be mould into the impress of somebody s patch boot or overshoe thus the track of an old conventionalism be visible on what be fresh from the sky but when we leave the pavement and our muffle hoof tramp beat upon a desolate extent of country road and be efface by the unfettered blast a soon a stamp then there be well air to breathe air that have not be breathe once and again air that have not be speak into word of falsehood formality and error like all the air of the dusky city how pleasant it be remark i while the snowflake fly into my mouth the moment it be open how very mild and balmy be this country air ah coverdale don t laugh at what little enthusiasm you have leave say one of my companion i maintain that this nitrous atmosphere be really exhilarate and at any rate we can never call ourselves regenerate men till a february northeaster shall be a grateful to u a the soft breeze of june so we all of u take courage rid fleetly and merrily along by stone fence that be half bury in the wave like drift and through patch of woodland where the tree trunk oppose a snow incrust side towards the northeast and within ken of desert villa with no footprint in their avenue and pass scatter dwell whence puff the smoke of country fire strongly impregnate with the pungent aroma of burn peat sometimes encounter a traveller we shout a friendly greet and he unmuffling his ear to the bluster and the snow spray and listen eagerly appear to think our courtesy worth less than the trouble which it cost him the churl he understand the shrill whistle of the blast but have no intelligence for our blithe tone of brotherhood this lack of faith in our cordial sympathy on the traveller s part be one among the innumerable token how difficult a task we have in hand for the reformation of the world we ride on however with still unflagging spirit and make such good companionship with the tempest that at our journey s end we profess ourselves almost loath to bid the rude blusterer good by but to own the truth i be little well than an icicle and begin to be suspicious that i have catch a fearful cold and now we be seat by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse the same fire that glimmer so faintly among my reminiscence at the begin of this chapter there we sit with the snow melt out of our hair and beard and our face all ablaze what with the past inclemency and present warmth it be indeed a right good fire that we find await u build up of great rough log and knotty limb and splinter fragment of an oak tree such a farmer be wont to keep for their own hearth since these crooked and unmanageable bough could never be measure into merchantable cord for the market a family of the old pilgrim might have swing their kettle over precisely such a fire a this only no doubt a big one and contrast it with my coal grate i felt so much the more that we have transport ourselves a world wide distance from the system of society that shackle u at

wish to offend the inhabitant of the town if they don t like it but they do the invalid in the oriel never clearly gather the detail of progress in this conflict of lay and clerical opinion but so it wa that to the disappointment of musician the grief of out walk lover and the regret of the junior population of the town and country round the band play on sunday afternoon cease in casterbridge barrack square by this time the maumbrys have frequently listen to the preaching of the gentle if narrow mind curate for these light natured hit or miss rackety people go to church like others for

conversation on his mention this fact to a caller he wa assure that it wa a matter of common talk that they be always together the observer would soon have learn this with his own eye if he have not be tell they begin to pa together nearly every day hitherto mr maumbry in fashionable walk clothe have usually be her husband s companion but this wa le frequent now the close and singular friendship between the two men go on for nearly a year when mr sainway wa present to a live in a densely populate town in the midland county he bid the parishioner of his old place a reluctant farewell and

flesh on account of the exertion require and draw up the watch by it chain like a bucket from a well but some thoughtful person who have see him walk across one of his field on a certain december morning sunny and exceedingly mild might have regard gabriel oak in other aspect than these in his face one might notice that many of the hue and curve of youth have tarry on to manhood there even remain in his remote cranny some relic of the boy his height and breadth would have be sufficient to make his presence impose have they be exhibit with due consideration but there be a way some men have rural and urban alike for which the mind be more responsible than flesh and sinew it be a way of curtail their dimension by their manner of show them and from a quiet modesty that would have become a vestal which seem continually to impress upon him that he have no great claim on the world s room oak walk unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend yet distinct from a bow of the shoulder this may be say to be a defect in an individual if he depend for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well which oak do not he have just reach the time of life at which young be cease to be the prefix of man in speak of one he be at the bright period of masculine growth for his intellect and his emotion be clearly separate he have pass the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingle them in the character of impulse and he have not yet arrive at the stage wherein they become unite again in the character of prejudice by the influence of a wife and family in short he be twenty eight and a bachelor the field he be in this morning slop to a ridge call norcombe hill through a spur of this hill run the highway between emminster and chalk newton casually glance over the hedge oak saw come down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon paint yellow and gaily mark draw by two horse a waggoner walk alongside bear a whip perpendicularly the waggon be lade with household good and window plant and on the apex of the whole sit a woman young and attractive gabriel have not behold the sight for more than half a minute when the vehicle be bring to a standstill just beneath his eye the tailboard of the waggon be go miss say the waggoner then i hear it fall say the girl in a soft though not particularly low voice i hear a noise i could not account for when we be come up the hill i ll run back do she answer the sensible horse stand perfectly still and the waggoner s step sink fainter and fainter in the distance the girl on the summit of the load sit motionless surround by table and chair with their leg upwards back by an oak settle and ornament in front by pot of geranium myrtle and cactus together with a cage canary all probably from the window of the house just vacate there be also a cat in a willow basket from the partly open lid of which she gaze with half close eye and affectionately survey the small bird around the handsome girl wait for some time idly in her place and the only sound hear in the stillness be the hop of the canary up and down the perch of it prison then she look attentively downwards it be not at the bird nor at the cat it be at an oblong package tie in paper and lie between them she turn her head to learn if the waggoner be come he be not yet in sight and her eye creep back to the package her thought seem to run upon what be inside it at length she draw the article into her lap and untie the paper cover a small swing look glass be disclose in which she proceed to survey herself attentively she part her lip and smile it be a fine morning and the sun light up to a scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wear and paint a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair the myrtle geranium and cactus pack around her be fresh and green and at such a leafless season they invest the whole concern of horse waggon furniture and girl with a peculiar vernal charm what possess her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the sparrow blackbird and unperceived farmer who be alone it spectator whether the smile begin a a factitious one to test her capacity in that art nobody know it end certainly in a real smile she blush at herself and see her reflection blush blush the more the change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an act from the dress hour in a bedroom to a time of travel out of door lend to the idle deed a novelty it do not intrinsically possess the picture be a delicate one woman s prescriptive infirmity have stalk into the sunlight which have clothe it in the freshness of an originality a cynical inference be irresistible by gabriel oak a he regard the scene generous though he fain would have be there be no necessity whatever for her look in the glass she do not adjust her hat or pat her hair or press a dimple into shape or do one thing to signify that any such intention have be her motive in take up the glass she simply observe herself a a fair product of nature in the feminine kind her thought seem to glide into far off though likely drama in which men would play a part vista of probable triumph the smile be of a phase suggest that heart be imagine a lose and win still this be but conjecture and the whole series of action be so idly put forth a to make it rash to assert that intention have any part in them at all the waggoner s step be hear return she put the glass in the paper and the whole again into it place when the waggon have pass on gabriel withdraw from his point of espial and descend into the road follow the vehicle to the turnpike gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill where the object of his contemplation now halt for the payment of toll about twenty step still remain between him and the gate when he hear a dispute it be a difference concern twopence between the person with the waggon and the man at the toll bar mi es s niece be upon the top of the thing and she say that s enough that i ve offer ye you great miser and she win t pay any more these be the waggoner s word very well then mi es s niece can t pass say the turnpike keeper close the gate oak look from one to the other of the disputant and fell into a reverie there be something in the tone of twopence remarkably insignificant threepence have a definite value a money it be an appreciable infringement on a day s wage and a such a higgle matter but twopence here he say step forward and hand twopence to the gatekeeper let the young woman pass he look up at her then she hear his word and look down gabriel s feature adhere throughout their form so exactly to the middle line between the beauty of st john and the ugliness of juda iscariot a represent in a window of the church he attend that not a single lineament could be select and call worthy either of distinction or notoriety the red jacket and dark haired maiden seem to think so too for she carelessly glance over him and tell her man to drive on she might have look her thanks to gabriel on a minute scale but she do not speak them more probably she felt none for in gain her a passage he have lose her her point and we know how woman take a favour of that kind the gatekeeper survey the retreat vehicle that s a handsome maid he say to oak but she have her fault say gabriel true farmer and the greatest of them be well what it be always beat people down ay ti so o no what then gabriel perhaps a little pique by the comely traveller s indifference glance back to where he have witness her performance over the hedge and say

the name of the venerable fray antonio agapida it be rather a superstructure rear upon the fragment which remain of his work it may be ask who be this same agapida who be cite with such deference yet whose name be not to be find in any of the catalogue of spanish author the question be hard to answer he appear to have be one of the many indefatigable author of spain who have fill the library of convent and cathedral with their tome without ever dreaming of bring their labor to the press he evidently be deeply and accurately inform of the particular of the war between his countryman and the moor a tract of history but too much overgrow with the weed of fable his glow zeal also in the cause of the catholic faith entitle him to be hold up a a model of the good old orthodox chronicler who record with such pious exultation the unite triumph of the cross and the sword it be deeply to be regret therefore that his manuscript deposit in the library of various convent have be disperse during the late convulsion in spain so that nothing be now to be meet of them but disjoint fragment these however be too precious to be suffer to fall into oblivion a they contain many curious fact not to be find in any other historian in the follow work therefore the manuscript of the worthy fray antonio will be adopt wherever it exist entire but will be fill up extend illustrate and corroborate by citation from various author both spanish and arabian who have treat of the subject those who may wish to know how far the work be indebted to the chronicle of fray antonio agapida may readily satisfy their curiosity by refer to his manuscript fragment carefully preserve in the library of the escurial before enter upon the history it may be a well to notice the opinion of certain of the most learn and devout historiographer of former time relative to this war marinus siculus historian to charles v pronounce it a war to avenge ancient injury receive by the christian from the moor to recover the kingdom of granada and to extend the name and honor of the christian religion lucio marino siculo cosas memorabiles de espana lib estevan de garibay one of the most distinguish spanish historian regard the war a a special act of divine clemency toward the moor to the end that those barbarian and infidel who have drag out so many century under the diabolical oppression of the absurd sect of mahomet should at length be reduce to the christian faith garibay compend hist espana lib c padre mariana also a venerable jesuit and the most renowned historian of spain consider the past domination of the moor a scourge inflict on the spanish nation for it iniquity but the conquest of granada the reward of heaven for it great act of propitiation in establish the glorious tribunal of the inquisition no sooner say the worthy father be this holy office open in spain than there shine forth a resplendent light then it be that through divine favor the nation increase in power and become competent to overthrow and trample down the moorish domination mariana hist espana lib c have thus cite high and venerable authority for consider this war in the light of one of those pious enterprise denominate crusade we trust we have say enough to engage the christian reader to follow u into the field and stand by u to the very issue of the encounter note to the revise edition the forego introduction prefix to the former edition of this work have be somewhat of a detriment to it fray antonio agapida be find to be an imaginary personage and this throw a doubt over the credibility of his chronicle which be increase by a vein of irony indulge here and there and by the occasional heighten of some of the incident and the romantic color of some of the scene a word or two explanatory may therefore be of service many of the observation in this note have already appear in an explanatory article which at mr murray ’ s request the author furnish to the london quarterly review the idea of the work be suggest while i be occupy at madrid in write the life of columbus in search for trace of his early life i be lead among the scene of the war of granada he have follow the spanish sovereign in some of their campaign and be present at the surrender of the moorish capital i actually weave some of these scene into the biography but find they occupy an undue space and stand out in romantic relief not in unison with the general course of the narrative my mind however have become so excite by the stir event and romantic achievement of this war that i could not return with composure to the sober biography i have in hand the idea then occur a a mean of allay the excitement to throw off a rough draught of the history of this war to be revise and complete at future leisure it appear to me that it true course and character have never be fully illustrate the world have receive a strangely pervert idea of it through florian ’ s romance of gonsalvo of cordova or through the legend equally fabulous entitle “ the civil war of granada ” by ginez perez de la hita the pretend work of an arabian contemporary but in reality a spanish fabrication it have be weave over with love tale and scene of sentimental gallantry totally opposite to it real character for it be in truth one of the sternest of those iron conflict sanctify by the title of “ holy war ” in fact the genuine nature of the war place it far above the need of any amatory embellishment it possess sufficient interest in the strike contrast present by the combatant of oriental and european creed costume and manner and in the hardy and harebrained enterprise the romantic adventure the picturesque foray through mountain region the dare assault and surprisal of cliff build castle and cragged fortress which succeed each other with a variety and brilliancy beyond the scope of mere invention the time of the contest also contribute to heighten the interest it be not long after the invention of gunpowder when firearm and artillery mingle the flash and smoke and thunder of modern warfare with the steely splendor of ancient chivalry and give an awful magnificence and terrible sublimity to battle and when the old moorish tower and castle that for age have frown defiance to the batter ram and catapult of classic tactic be topple down by the lombard of the spanish engineer it be one of the case in which history rise superior to fiction the more i think about the subject the more i be tempt to undertake it and the facility at hand at length determine me in the library of madrid and in the private library of the american consul mr rich i have access to various chronicle and other work both print and in manuscript write at the time by eyewitness and in some instance by person who have actually mingle in the scene record and give description of them from different point of view and with different detail these work be often diffuse and tedious and occasionally discolor by the bigotry superstition and fierce intolerance of the age but their page be illumine at time with scene of high emprise of romantic generosity and heroic valor which flash upon the reader with additional splendor from the surround darkness i collate these various work some of which have never appear in print draw from each fact relative to the different enterprise arrange them in a clear and lucid order a i could command and endeavor to give them somewhat of a graphic effect by connect them with the manner and custom of the age in which they occur the rough draught be complete i lay the manuscript aside and proceed with the life of columbus after this be finish and send to the press i make a tour in andalusia visit the ruin of the moorish town fortress and castle and the wild mountain pass and defile which have be the scene of the most remarkable event of the war and pass some time in the ancient palace of the alhambra the once favorite abode of the moorish monarch everywhere i take note from the most advantageous point of view of whatever could serve to give local verity and graphic effect to the scene describe have take up my abode for a time at seville i then resume my manuscript and rewrite it benefit by my travel note and the fresh and vivid impression of my recent tour in construct my chronicle i adopt the fiction of a spanish monk a the chronicler fray antonio agapida be intend a a personification of the monkish zealot who hover about the sovereign in their campaign mar the chivalry of the camp by the bigotry of the cloister and chronicle in rapturous strain every act of intolerance toward the moor in fact scarce a sally of the pretend friar when he burst forth in rapturous eulogy of some great stroke of selfish policy on the part of ferdinand or exult over some overwhelm disaster of the gallant and devote moslem but be take almost word for word from one or other of the orthodox chronicler of spain the ironical vein also be provoke by the mixture of kingcraft and priestcraft discernible throughout this great enterprise and the mistake zeal and self delusion of many of it most gallant and generous champion the romantic color seem to belong to the nature of the subject and be in harmony with what i have see in my tour through the poetical and romantic region in which the event have take place with all these deduction the work in all it essential point be faithful to historical fact and build upon substantial document it be a great satisfaction to me therefore after the doubt that have be express of the authenticity of my chronicle to find it repeatedly and largely use by don miguel

his chair a little near the attention of the whole company be now turn upon the speaker he be an old gentleman one side of whose face be no match for the other the eyelid droop and hang down like an unhinge window shutter indeed the whole side of his head be dilapidate and seem like the wing of a house shut up and haunt i ’ ll warrant that side be well stuff with ghost story there be a universal demand for the tale “ nay ” say the old gentleman “ it ’ s a mere anecdote—and a very commonplace one but such a it be you shall have it it be a story that i once hear my uncle tell when i be a boy but whether a have happen to himself or to another i can not recollect but no matter it ’ s very likely it happen to himself for he be a man very apt to meet with strange adventure i have hear him tell of others much more singular at any rate we will suppose it happen to himself ” “ what kind of man be your uncle ” say the question gentleman “ why he be rather a dry shrewd kind of body a great traveller and fond of tell his adventure ” “ pray how old might he have be when this happen ” “ when what happen ” cry the gentleman with the flexible nose impatiently— “ egad you have not give any thing a chance to happen —come never mind our uncle ’ s age let u have his adventure ” the inquisitive gentleman be for the moment silence the old gentleman with the haunt head proceed the adventure of my uncle many year since a long time before the french revolution my uncle have pass several month at paris the english and french be on well term in those day than at present and mingle cordially together in society the english go abroad to spend money then and the french be always ready to help them they go abroad to save money at present and that they can do without french assistance perhaps the travel english be few and choicer then than at present when the whole nation have break loose and inundate the continent at any rate they circulate more readily and currently in foreign society and my uncle during his residence in paris make many very intimate acquaintance among the french noblesse some time afterwards he be make a journey in the winter time in that part of normandy call the pay de caux when a evening be close in he perceive the turret of an ancient chateau rise out of the tree of it wall park each turret with it high conical roof of gray slate like a candle with an extinguisher on it “ to whom do that chateau belong friend ” cry my uncle to a meager but fiery postillion who with tremendous jack boot and cock hat be flounder on before him “ to monseigneur the marquis de —— ” say the postillion touch his hat partly out of respect to my uncle and partly out of reverence to the noble name pronounce my uncle recollect the marquis for a particular friend in paris who have often express a wish to see him at his paternal chateau my uncle be an old traveller one that know how to turn thing to account he revolve for a few moment in his mind how agreeable it would be to his friend the marquis to be surprise in this sociable way by a pop visit and how much more agreeable to himself to get into snug quarter in a chateau and have a relish of the marquis ’ s well know kitchen and a smack of his superior champagne and burgundy rather than take up with the miserable lodgment and miserable fare of a country inn in a few minute therefore the meager postillion be crack his whip like a very devil or like a true frenchman up the long straight avenue that lead to the chateau you have no doubt all see french chateau a every body travel in france nowadays this be one of the old stand naked and alone in the midst of a desert of gravel walk and cold stone terrace with a cold look formal garden cut into angle and rhomboid and a cold leafless park divide geometrically by straight alley and two or three noseless cold look statue without any clothe and fountain spout cold water enough to make one ’ s teeth chatter at least such be the feel they impart on the wintry day of my uncle ’ s visit though in hot summer weather i ’ ll warrant there be glare enough to scorch one ’ s eye out the smack of the postillion ’ s whip which grow more and more intense the near they approach frighten a flight of pigeon out of the dove cote and rook out of the roof and finally a crew of servant out of the chateau with the marquis at their head he be enchant to see my uncle for his chateau like the house of our worthy

scott be encourage to do so by the cordial reception i have experience from him at abbotsford a few year previously and by the favorable opinion he have express to others of my early write i accordingly send him the print number of the sketch book in a parcel by coach and at the same time write to him hint that since i have have the pleasure of partake of his hospitality a reverse have take place in my affair which make the successful exercise of my pen all important to me i beg him therefore to look over the literary article i have forward to him and if he think they would bear european republication to ascertain whether mr constable would be incline to be the publisher the parcel contain my work go by coach to scott ’ s address in edinburgh the letter go by mail to his residence in the country by the very first post i receive a reply before he have see my work “ i be down at kelso ” say he “ when your letter reach abbotsford i be now on my way to town and will converse with constable and do all in my power to forward your view i assure you nothing will give me more pleasure ” the hint however about a reverse of fortune have strike the quick apprehension of scott and with that practical and efficient good will which belong to his nature he have already devise a way of aid me a weekly periodical he go on to inform me be about to be set up in edinburgh support by the most respectable talent and amply furnish with all the necessary information the appointment of the editor for which ample fund be provide would be five hundred pound sterling a year with the reasonable prospect of far advantage this situation be apparently at his disposal he frankly offer to me the work however he intimate be to have somewhat of a political bear and he express an apprehension that the tone it be desire to adopt might not suit me “ yet i risk the question ” add he “ because i know no man so well qualify for this important task and perhaps because it will necessarily bring you to edinburgh if my proposal do not suit you need only keep the matter secret and there be no harm do ‘ and for my love i pray you wrong me not ’ if on the contrary you think it could be make to suit you let me know a soon a possible address castle street edinburgh ” in a postscript write from edinburgh he add “ i be just come here and have glance over the sketch book it be positively beautiful and increase my desire to crimp you if it be possible some difficulty there always be in manage such a matter especially at the outset but we will obviate them a much a we possibly can ” the follow be from an imperfect draught of my reply which undergo some modification in the copy send “ i can not express how much i be gratify by your letter i have begin to feel a if i have take an unwarrantable liberty but somehow or other there be a genial sunshine about you that warm every creep thing into heart and confidence your literary proposal both surprise and flatter me a it evince a much high opinion of my talent than i have myself ” i then go on to explain that i find myself peculiarly unfit for the situation offer to me not merely by my political opinion but by the very constitution and habit of my mind “ my whole course of life ” i observe “ have be desultory and i be unfit for any periodically recur task or any stipulate labor of body or mind i have no command of my talent such a they be and have to watch the vary of my mind a i would those of a weathercock practice and train may bring me more into rule but at present i be a useless for regular service a one of my own country indian or a don cossack “ i must therefore keep on pretty much a i have begin write when i can not when i would i shall occasionally shift my residence and write whatever be suggest by object before me or whatever rise in my imagination and hope to write well and more copiously by and by “ i be play the egotist but i know no well way of answer your proposal than by show what a very good for nothing kind of be i be should mr constable feel incline to make a bargain for the ware i have on hand he will encourage me to far enterprise and it will be something like trade with a gypsy for the fruit of his prowl who may at one time have nothing but a wooden bowl to offer and at another time a silver tankard ” in reply scott express regret but not surprise at my decline what might have prove a troublesome duty he then recur to the original subject of our correspondence enter into a detail of the various term upon which arrangement be make between author and bookseller that i might take my choice express the most encourage confidence of the success of my work and of previous work which i have produce in america “ i do no more ” add he “ than open the trench with constable but i be sure if you will take the trouble to write to him you will find him dispose to treat your overture with every degree of attention or if you think it of consequence in the first place to see me i shall be in london in the course of a month and whatever my experience can command be most heartily at your command but i can add little to what i have say above except my earnest recommendation to constable to enter into the negotiation ” i can not avoid subjoining in a note a succeed paragraph of scott ’ s letter which though it do not relate to the main subject of our correspondence be too characteristic to be omit some time previously i have send miss sophia scott small duodecimo american edition of her father ’ s poem publish in edinburgh in quarto volume show the “ nigromancy ” of the american press by which a quart of wine be conjure into a pint bottle scott observe “ in my hurry i have not thank you in sophia ’ s name for the kind attention which furnish her with the american volume i be not quite sure i can add my own since you have make her acquaint with much more of papa ’ s folly than she would ever otherwise have learn for i have take special care they should never see any of those thing during their early year i think i have tell you that walter be sweep the firmament with a feather like a maypole and indent the pavement with a sword like a scythe in other word he have become a whisker hussar in the th dragoon ” before the receipt of this most oblige letter however i have determine to look to no lead bookseller for a launch but to throw my work before the public at my own risk and let it sink or swim accord to it merit i write to that effect to scott and soon receive a reply “ i observe with pleasure that you be go to come forth in britain it be certainly not the very best way to publish on one ’ s own accompt for the bookseller set their face against the circulation of such work a do not pay an amaze toll to themselves but they have lose the art of altogether dam up the road in such case between the author and the public which they be once able to do a effectually a diabolus in john bunyan ’ s holy war close up the window of my lord understand ’ s mansion i be sure of one thing that you have only to be know to the british public to be admire by them and i would not say so unless i really be of that opinion “ if you ever see a witty but rather local publication call blackwood ’ s edinburgh magazine you will find some notice of your work in the last number the author be a friend of mine to whom i have introduce you in your literary capacity his name be lockhart a young man of very considerable talent and who will soon be intimately connect with my family my faithful friend knickerbocker be to be next examine and illustrate constable be extremely will to enter into consideration of a treaty for your work but i foresee will be still more so when your name be up and may go from toledo to madrid “ and that will soon be the case i trust to be in london about the middle of the month and promise myself great pleasure in once again shake you by the hand ” the first volume of the sketch book be put to press in london a i have resolve at my own risk by a bookseller unknown to fame and without any of the usual art by which a work be trumpet into notice still some attention have be call to it by the extract which have previously appear in the literary gazette and by the kind word speak by the editor of that periodical and it be get into fair circulation when my worthy bookseller fail before the first month be over and the sale be interrupt at this juncture scott arrive in london i call to him for help a i be stick in the mire and more propitious than hercules he put his own shoulder to the wheel through his favorable representation murray be quickly induce to undertake the future publication of the work which he have previously decline a far edition of the first volume be strike off and the second volume be put to press and from that time murray become my publisher conduct himself in all his deal with that fair open and liberal spirit which have obtain for him the well merit appellation of the prince of bookseller thus under the kind and cordial auspex of sir walter scott i begin my literary career in europe and i feel that i be but discharge in a trifle degree

obliterate the remembrance of his gentleness and worth and here before set forth let me indulge in a few previous remark on spanish scenery and spanish travel many be apt to picture spain to their imagination a a soft southern region deck out with the luxuriant charm of voluptuous italy on the contrary though there be exception in some of the maritime province yet for the great part it be a stern melancholy country with rugged mountain and long sweep plain destitute of tree and indescribably silent and lonesome partake of the savage and solitary character of africa what add to this silence and loneliness be the absence of sing bird a natural consequence of the want of grove and hedge the vulture and the eagle be see wheel about the mountain cliff and soar over the plain and group of shy bustard stalk about the heath but the myriad of small bird which animate the whole face of other country be meet with in but few province in spain and in those chiefly among the orchard and garden which surround the habitation of man in the interior province the traveller occasionally traverse great tract cultivate with grain a far a the eye can reach wave at time with verdure at other time naked and sunburnt but he look round in vain for the hand that have till the soil at length he perceive some village on a steep hill or rugged crag with moulder battlement and ruin watchtower a stronghold in old time against civil war or moorish inroad for the custom among the peasantry of congregating together for mutual protection be still keep up in most part of spain in consequence of the maraud of roving freebooter but though a great part of spain be deficient in the garniture of grove and forest and the soft charm of ornamental cultivation yet it scenery be noble in it severity and in unison with the attribute of it people and i think that i well understand the proud hardy frugal and abstemious spaniard his manly defiance of hardship and contempt of effeminate indulgence since i have see the country he inhabit there be something too in the sternly simple feature of the spanish landscape that impress on the soul a feel of sublimity the immense plain of the castile and of la mancha extend a far a the eye can reach derive an interest from their very nakedness and immensity and possess in some degree the solemn grandeur of the ocean in range over these boundless waste the eye catch sight here and there of a straggle herd of cattle attend by a lonely herdsman motionless a a statue with his long slender pike taper up like a lance into the air or behold a long train of mule slowly move along the waste like a train of camel in the desert or a single horseman armed with blunderbuss and stiletto and prowl over the plain thus the country the habit the very look of the people have something of the arabian character the general insecurity of the country be evince in the universal use of weapon the herdsman in the field the shepherd in the plain have his musket and his knife the wealthy villager rarely venture to the market town without his trabuco and perhaps a servant on foot with a blunderbuss on his shoulder and the most petty journey be undertake with the preparation of a warlike enterprise the danger of the road produce also a mode of travel resemble on a diminutive scale the caravan of the east the arrieros or carrier congregate in convoy and set off in large and well armed train on appoint day while additional traveller swell their number and contribute to their strength in this primitive way be the commerce of the country carry on the muleteer be the general medium of traffic and the legitimate traverser of the land cross the peninsula from the pyrenees and the asturias to the alpuxarras the serrania de ronda and even to the gate of gibraltar he life frugally and hardily his alforjas of coarse cloth hold his scanty stock of provision a leathern bottle hang at his saddle bow contain wine or water for a supply across barren mountain and thirsty plain a mule cloth spread upon the grind be his bed at night and his pack saddle his pillow his low but clean limbed and sinewy form betoken strength his complexion be dark and sunburnt his eye resolute but quiet in it expression except when kindle by sudden emotion his demeanor be frank manly and courteous and he never pass you without a grave salutation dios guarde à usted “ va usted con dios caballero ” “ god guard you ” “ god be with you cavalier ” a these men have often their whole fortune at stake upon the burden of their mule they have their weapon at hand sling to their saddle and ready to be snatch out for desperate defence but their unite number render them secure against petty band of marauder and the solitary bandolero armed to the teeth and mount on his andalusian steed hover about them like a pirate about a merchant convoy without dare to assault the spanish muleteer have an inexhaustible stock of song and ballad with which to beguile his incessant wayfaring the air be rude and simple consist of but few inflection these he chant forth with a loud voice and long drawl cadence seat sideways on his mule who seem to listen with infinite gravity and to keep time with his pace to the tune the couplet thus chant be often old traditional romance about the moor or some legend of a saint or some love ditty or what be still more frequent some ballad about a bold contrabandista or hardy bandolero for the smuggler and the robber be poetical hero among the common people of spain often the song of the muleteer be compose at the instant and relate to some local scene or some incident of the journey this talent of sing and improvise be frequent in spain and be say to have be inherit from the moor there be something wildly please in listen to these ditty among the rude and lonely scene they illustrate accompany a they be by the occasional jingle of the mule bell it have a most picturesque effect also to meet a train of muleteer in some mountain pass first you hear the bell of the lead mule break with their simple melody the stillness of the airy height or perhaps the voice of the muleteer admonish some tardy or wander animal or chant at the full stretch of his lung some traditionary ballad at length you see the mule slowly wind along the cragged defile sometimes descend precipitous cliff so a to present themselves in full relief against the sky sometimes toil up the deep arid chasm below you a they approach you descry their gay decoration of worsted stuff tassel and saddle cloth while a they pass by the ever ready trabuco sling behind the pack and saddle give a hint of the insecurity of the road the ancient kingdom of granada into which we be about to penetrate be one of the most mountainous region of spain vast sierra or chain of mountain destitute of shrub or tree and mottle with variegate marble and granite elevate their sunburnt summit against a deep blue sky yet in their rugged bosom lie ingulfed verdant and fertile valley where the desert and the garden strive for mastery and the very rock be a it be compel to yield the fig the orange and the citron and to blossom with the myrtle and the rise in the wild pass of these mountain the sight of wall town and village build like eagle ’ nest among the cliff and surround by moorish battlement or of ruin watch tower perch on lofty peak carry the mind back to the chivalric day of christian and moslem warfare and to the romantic struggle for the conquest of granada in traverse these lofty sierra the traveller be often oblige to alight and lead his horse up and down the steep and jag ascent and descent resemble the break step of a staircase sometimes the road wind along dizzy precipice without parapet to guard him from the gulf below and then will plunge down steep and dark and dangerous declivity sometimes it struggle through rugged barrancos or ravine wear by winter torrent the obscure path of the contrabandista while ever and anon the ominous cross the monument of robbery and murder erect on a mound of stone at some lonely part of the road admonish the traveller that he be among the haunt of bandit perhaps at that very moment under the eye of some lurk bandolero sometimes in wind through the narrow valley he be startle by a hoarse bellow and behold above him on some green fold of the mountain a herd of fierce andalusian bull destine for the combat of the arena i have felt if i may so express it an agreeable horror in thus contemplate near at hand these terrific animal clothe with tremendous strength and range their native pasture in untamed wildness stranger almost to the face of man they know no one but the solitary herdsman who attend upon them and even he at time dare not venture to approach them the low bellow of these bull and their menace aspect a they look down from their rocky height give additional wildness to the savage scenery i have be betray unconsciously into a long disquisition than i intend on the general feature of spanish travel but there be a romance about all the recollection of the peninsula dear to the imagination a our propose route to granada lay through mountainous region where the road be little well than mule path and say to be frequently beset by robber we take due travel precaution forwarding the most valuable part of our luggage a day or two in advance by the arrieros we retain merely clothe and necessary for the journey and money for the expense of the road with a little surplus of hard dollar by way of robber purse to satisfy the gentleman of the road should we be assail unlucky be the too wary traveller who have grudge this precaution fall into their clutch empty hand they be apt to give him a sound ribroasting for cheat them out of their due “ caballeros like them can not afford to scour the road and risk the gallows for nothing ” a couple of stout steed be provide for our own mount and a third for our scanty luggage and the conveyance of a sturdy biscayan lad about twenty year of age who be to be our guide our groom our valet and at all time our guard for the latter office he be provide with a formidable trabuco or carbine with which he promise to defend u against rateros or solitary footpad but a to powerful band like that of the “ son of ecija ” he confess they be quite beyond his prowess he make much vainglorious boast about his weapon at the outset of the journey though to the discredit of his generalship it be suffer to hang unload behind his saddle accord to our stipulation the man from whom we hire the horse be to be at the expense of their fee and stabling on the journey a well a of the maintenance of our biscayan squire who of course be provide with fund for the purpose we take care however to give the latter a private hint that though we make a close bargain with his master it be all in his favor a if he prove a good man and true both he and the horse should live at our cost and the money provide for their maintenance remain in his pocket this unexpected largess with the occasional present of a cigar win his heart completely he be in truth a faithful cheery kind hearted creature a full of saw and proverb a that miracle of squire the renowned sancho himself whose name by the by we bestow upon him and like a true spaniard though treat by u with companionable familiarity he never for a moment in his utmost hilarity overstep the bound of respectful decorum such be our minor preparation for the journey but above all we lay in an ample stock of good humor and a genuine disposition to be please determine to travel in true contrabandista style take thing a we find them rough or smooth and mingle with all class and condition in a kind of vagabond companionship it be the true way to travel in

go overboard before we get across but washington irving return to new york at the begin of the year with health restore what follow will be tell in the introduction to the other volume of this history of new york by diedrich knickerbocker h m the author s apology the follow work in which at the outset nothing more be contemplate than a temporary jeu d esprit be commence in company with my brother the late peter irving esq our idea be to parody a small hand book which have recently appear entitle a picture of new york like that our work be to begin an historical sketch to be follow by notice of the custom manner and institution of the city write in a serio comic vein and treat local error folly and abuse with good humor satire to burlesque the pedantic lore display in certain american work our historical sketch be to commence with the creation of the world and we lay all kind of work under contribution for trite citation relevant or irrelevant to give it the proper air of learn research before this crude mass of mock erudition could be digest into form my brother depart for europe and i be leave to prosecute the enterprise alone i now alter the plan of the work discard all idea of a parody on the picture of new york i determine that what have be originally intend a an introductory sketch should comprise the whole work and form a comic history of the city i accordingly mould the mass of citation and disquisition into introductory chapter form the first book but it soon become evident to me that like robinson crusoe with his boat i have begin on too large a scale and that to launch my history successfully i must reduce it proportion i accordingly resolve to confine it to the period of the dutch domination which in it rise progress and decline present that unity of subject require by classic rule it be a period also at that time almost a terra incognita in history in fact i be surprise to find how few of my fellow citizen be aware that new york have ever be call new amsterdam or have hear of the name of it early dutch governor or care a straw about their ancient dutch progenitor this then break upon me a the poetic age of our city poetic from it very obscurity and open like the early and obscure day of ancient rome to all the embellishment of heroic fiction i hail my native city a fortunate above all other american city in have an antiquity thus extend back into the region of doubt and fable neither do i conceive i be commit any grievous historical sin in help out the few fact i could collect in this remote and forget region with figment of my own brain or in give characteristic attribute to the few name connect with it which i might dig up from oblivion in this doubtless i reason like a young and inexperienced writer besotted with his own fancy and my presumptuous trespass into this sacred though neglect region of history have meet with deserve rebuke from men of sober mind it be too late however to recall the shaft thus rashly launch to any one whose sense of fitness it may wind i can only say with hamlet let my disclaim from a purpose evil free me so far in your most generous thought that i have shoot my arrow o er the house and hurt my brother i will say this in far apology for my work that if it have take an unwarrantable liberty with our early provincial history it have at least turn attention to that history and provoke research it be only since this work appear that the forget archive of the province have be rummage and the fact and personage of the olden time rescue from the dust of oblivion and elevate into whatever importance they may actually possess the main object of my work in fact have a bear wide from the sober aim of history but one which i trust will meet with some indulgence from poetic mind it be to embody the tradition of our city in an amuse form to illustrate it local humor custom and peculiarity to clothe home scene and place and familiar name with those imaginative and whimsical association so seldom meet with in our new country but which live like charm and spell about the city of the old world bind the heart of the native inhabitant to his home in this i have reason to believe i have in some measure succeed before the appearance of my work the popular tradition of our city be unrecorded the peculiar and racy custom and usage derive from our dutch progenitor be unnoticed or regard with indifference or advert to with a sneer now they form a convivial currency and be bring forward on all occasion they link our whole community together in good humor and good fellowship they be the rally point of home feel the season of our civic festivity the staple of local tale and local pleasantry and be so harp upon by our writer of popular fiction that i find myself almost crowd off the legendary grind which i be the first to explore by the host who have follow in my footstep i dwell on this head because at the first appearance of my work it aim and drift be misapprehend by some of the descendant of the dutch worthy and because i understand that now and then one may still be find to regard it with a captious eye the far great part however i have reason to flat myself receive my good humor picturing in the same temper with which they be execute and when i find after a lapse of nearly forty year this haphazard production of my youth still cherish among them when i find it very name become a household word and use to give the home stamp to everything recommend for popular acceptation such a knickerbocker society knickerbocker insurance company knickerbocker steamboat knickerbocker omnibus knickerbocker bread and knickerbocker ice and when i find new yorkers of dutch descent pride themselves upon be genuine knickerbockers i please myself with the persuasion that i have strike the right chord that my deal with the good old dutch time and the custom and usage derive from them be n harmony with the feel and humor of my townsman that i have open a vein of pleasant association and quaint characteristic peculiar to my native place and which it inhabitant will not willingly suffer to pass away and that though other history of new york may appear of high claim to learn acceptation and may take their dignify and appropriate rank in the family library knickerbocker s history will still be receive with good humor indulgence and be thumb and chuckle over by the

and the horse nod and stamp at the fly and the loiter figure that appear now and then in desultory fashion many of them imagine that they understand the west and sympathize with it and appreciate it bigness and it freedom from convention one slim young woman have just tell the thin face school teacher on a vacation with whom she have form one of those evanescent travel acquaintance that she already know the west from instinct and from manley s letter she love it she say because manley love it and because it be to be her home and because it be so big and so free out here one could think

that the slim young woman with the yellow brown hair and yellow brown eye to match be go to marry manley she have forget his other name though the young woman have mention it and would live on a ranch a cattle ranch she smile with somewhat wistful sympathy and hop the young woman would be happy and the young woman wave her hand with the glove only half pull on toward the shadow dapple prairie and

depot oh yes thank you i almost forget that umbrella and i might need it yes i ll write to you i should hate to drop out of your mind completely address me mr manley fleetwood hope montana good by i wish ” she trail off down the aisle with eye shin in the wake of the grinning porter she hurry down the step glance hastily along the platform up at the car window where the fade little school teacher be smile wearily down at her wave her hand throw a dainty little kiss nod a gay farewell smile vaguely at the conductor who have be respectfully pleasant to her and then she be look at the rear platform of the recede train mechanically not yet quite realize why it be that her heart go heavy so suddenly she turn then and look about her in a surprise inquire fashion manley it would seem be not at hand to welcome her she have expect his face to be the first she look upon in that town but she try not to be greatly perturb at his absence so many thing may detain one at that moment a young fellow whose clothe emphatically proclaim him a cowboy come diffidently up to her tilt his hat backward an inch or so and leave it that way thereby unconsciously give himself an air of candor which should have be reassure “ fleetwood be detain you be expect to you re the lady he be expect aren t you ” she have be look questioningly at her violin box and two trunk stand on their end far down the platform and she smile vaguely without glance at him “ yes i hope he isn t sick or ” “ i ll take you over to the hotel and go tell him you re here ” he volunteer somewhat curtly and pick up her bag “ oh thank you ” this time her eye graze his face inattentively she follow him down the rough step of planking and up an extremely dusty road one could scarcely call it a street to an uninviting build with crooked window and a high false front of unpainted board the young fellow open a sag door let her pass into a narrow hallway and from there into a stuffy hopelessly conventional fifth rate parlor hand her the bag and depart with another tilt of the hat which place it at a different angle the sentence mean for farewell she do not catch for she be star at a wooden face portrait upon an easel the portrait of a man with a droop mustache and porky cheek and dead look eye “ and i expect bearskin rug and antler on the wall and big fireplace ” she remark aloud and sigh then she turn and pull aside a coarse curtain of dusty machine make lace and look after her guide he be just disappear into a saloon across the street and she drop the curtain precipitately a if she be ashamed of spy “ oh well i ve hear all cowboy be more or less intemperate ” she excuse again aloud she sit down upon an atrocious red plush chair and wrinkle her nose spitefully at the porky cheek portrait “ i suppose you re the proprietor ” she accuse “ or else the proprietor s son i wish you wouldn t squint like that if i have to stop here long than ten minute i shall certainly turn you face to the wall ” whereupon with another grimace she turn her back upon it and look out of the window then she stand up impatiently look at her watch and sit down again upon the red plush chair “ he didn t tell me whether manley be sick ” she say suddenly with some resentment “ he be awfully abrupt in his manner oh you ” she rise pick up an old newspaper from the marble top table with uncertain leg and spread it ungently over the portrait upon the easel then she go to the window and look out again “ i feel perfectly sure that cowboy go and get drink immediately ” she complain drum pettishly upon the glass “ and i don t suppose he tell manley at all ” the cowboy be innocent of the charge however and he be do his energetic best to tell manley he have go straight through the saloon and into the small room behind where a man lay sprawl upon a bed in one corner he be asleep and his clothe be wrinkle a if he have lie there long his head rest upon his fold arm and he be snoring loudly the young fellow go up and take him roughly by the shoulder “ here i think i tell you to straighten up ” he cry disgustedly “ come alive the train s come and go and your girl s wait for you over to the hotel d you hear ” “ uh huh ” the man open one eye grunt and close it again the other yank him half off the bed and swear this bring both eye open glassy with whisky and sleep he sit wobble upon the edge of the bed star stupidly “ can t you get anything through you ” his tormentor exclaim “ you want your girl to find out you re drink you get the license in your pocket you re suppose to get splice this evening and look at you ” he turn and go out to the bartender “ why didn t you pour that coffee into him like i tell you ” he demand “ we ve get to get him steady on his pin somehow ” the bartender be sprawl half over the bar apathetically read the sport news of a tear sunday edition of an eastern paper he look up from under his eyebrow and grunt “ how you go to pour coffee down a man that lay flat on his belly and win t open his mouth ” he inquire in an injure tone “ sleep s all he need anyway he ll be all right by morning ” the other snort dissent “ he ll be all right by dark or he ll feel a whole lot bad ” he promise grimly “ dig up some ice and a good jolt of bromo if you ve get it and a towel or two ” the bartender wearily push the paper to one side reach languidly under the bar and lay hold of a round blue bottle yawn uninterestedly he pour a double portion of the white crystal into a glass half fill another under the faucet of the water cooler and hold them out “ dump that into him then ” he advise “ it ll help some if you get it down what s the sweat to get him marry off to day win t the girl wait ” “ i never ask her you pound up some ice and bring it in will you ” the volunteer nurse kick open the door into the little room and go in hastily pour the bromo seltzer from one glass to the other to keep it from foam out of all bound his patient be still sit upon the edge of the bed where he have leave him slump forward with his head in his hand he look up stupidly his eye bloodshot and swell of lid “ s the train come in yet ” he ask thickly “ s you be it kent ” “ the train s come and your girl be wait for you at the hotel here throw this into you and for god s sake brace up you make me tire drink her down quick the foam s good for you here you take the stuff in the bottom too get it take off your coat so i can get at you you don t look much like get marry and that s no josh ” fleetwood shake his head with drunken gravity and groan “ i ought to be kill drink to day ” he sag forward again and seem dispose to shed tear “ she ll never forgive me she ” kent jerk him to his foot peremptorily “ aw look here i m try to sober you up you ve get to do your part see here s some ice in a towel you get it on your head open up your shirt so i can bathe your chest don t do any good to blubber around about it your girl can t hear you and jim and i ain t sympathetic set down in this chair where we can get at you ” he enforce his command with some vigor and fleetwood groan again but he shed no more tear and he grow momentarily more lucid a the treatment take effect the tear be be shed in the stuffy little hotel parlor the young woman look often at her watch go into the hallway and open the out door several time meditate a search of the town and draw back always with a timid flutter of heart because it be all so crude and strange and the saloon so numerous and terrify in their very bald simplicity she be worry about manley and she wish that cowboy would come out of the saloon and bring her lover to her she have never dream of be treat in this way no one come near her and she have secretly expect to cause something of a flutter in this little town they call hope surely young girl from the east come out to get marry to their sweetheart weren t so numerous that they should be ignore if there be other people in the hotel they do not manifest their presence save by disquiet noise muffle by intervene partition she grow thirsty but she hesitate to explore the depth of this dreary abode in fear of bad horror than the parlor furniture and all the place of refreshment which she could see from the window or the door look terribly masculine and unmoral and a if they do not know there exist such thing a ice cream or soda or sherbet it be after an hour of this that the tear come which be say a good deal for her courage it seem to her then that manley must be dead what else could keep him so long away from her after three year of impassioned longing write twice a week with punctilious regularity he know that she be come she have telegraph from st paul and have receive a joyful reply lavishly express in seventeen word instead of the ten word limit and they be to have be marry immediately upon her arrival that cowboy have know she be come he must also have know why manley do not meet her and she wish futilely that she have question him instead of walk beside him without a word he should have explain he would have explain if he have not be so very anxious to get inside that saloon and get drink she have always hear that cowboy be chivalrous and brave and fascinate in their picturesque dare deviltry but from the lone specimen which she have meet she could not see that they possess any of those quality if all cowboy be like that she hop that she would not be compel to meet any of them and why didn t manley come it be then that an inner door a door which she have want to open but have lack courage squeak upon it hinge and an ill keep bundle of hair be thrust in top a weather beat face and a scrawny little body two fade inquisitive eye look her over and the woman sidle in somewhat abash but too curious to remain outside “ oh yes ” she seem to be answer some inner question “ i didn t know you be here ” she go over and remove the newspaper from the portrait “ that breed girl of mine ain t get the least idea of how to straighten up a room ” she observe complainingly “ i guess she think this picture be make to hang thing on i ll have to round her up again and tell her a few thing this be my first husband he be in politics and get beat and so he kill himself he couldn t stand to have folk give him the laugh ” she speak with pride “ he be a real handsome man don t you think you mighta take off the paper it didn t belong

fragrance the yellow grey crumble wall be green in place with wrinkle hart tongue and be top with sweet williams and spread house leek and stone crop and wild flower whose delicious sweetness make for the drowsy repose of perfect summer but amid all that mass of glow colour the two young figure seat on the grey old tomb stand out conspicuously the man be in conventional hunt dress red coat white

broad and more square than be usual in a woman and the wide fine forehead and aquiline nose mark the high descent from saxon through norman the glorious mass of red hair of the true flame colour show the blood of another ancient ancestor of northern race and suit well with the voluptuous curve of the full crimson lip the purple black eye the raven eyebrow and eyelash and the fine curve of the

legged long neck a straight a a lance with head poise on the proud neck like a lily on it stem stephen norman certainly give promise of a splendid womanhood pride self reliance and dominance be mark in every feature in her bear and in her light movement her companion harold an wolf be some five year her senior and by mean of those five year and certain quality have long stand in the position of her mentor he be more than six foot two in height deep chested broad shoulder lean flank long armed and big hand he have that appearance strength with well poise neck and forward set of the head which mark the successful athlete the two sit quiet listen through the quiet hum of afternoon come the voice of the two child outside the lich gate under the shade of the spread cedar the horse stamp occasionally a the fly trouble them the groom be mount one hold the delicate limbed white arab the other the great black horse i would rather be an angel than god the little girl who make the remark be an ideal specimen of the village sunday school child blue eye rosy cheek thick legged with her straight brown hair tie into a hard bunch with a much crease cherry colour ribbon a glance at the girl would have satisfy the most sceptical a to her goodness without be in any way smug she be radiant with self satisfaction and well do a child of the people an early riser a help to her mother a good angel to her father a little mother to her brother and sister cleanly in mind and body self reliant full of faith cheerful the other little girl be prettier but of a more stubborn type more passionate less organise and infinitely more assertive black haired black eye swarthy large mouth snub nose the very type and essence of unrestrained impulsive emotional sensual nature a see eye would have note inevitable danger for the early year of her womanhood she seem amaze by the self abnegation imply by her companion s statement after a pause she reply i wouldn t i d rather be up at the top of everything and give order to the angel if i choose i can t think marjorie why you d rather take order than give them that s just it susan i don t want to give order i d rather obey them it must be very terrible to have to think of thing so much that you want everything do your own way and besides i shouldn t like to have to be just why not the voice be truculent though there be wistfulness in it also oh susan just fancy have to punish for of course justice need punish a well a praise now an angel have such a nice time help people and comfort them and bring sunshine into dark place put down fresh dew every morning make the flower grow and bring baby and take care of them till their mother find them of course god be very good and very sweet and very merciful but oh he must be very terrible all the same i would rather be god and able to do thing then the child move off out of earshot the two seat on the tombstone look after them the first to speak be the girl who say that s very sweet and good of marjorie but do you know harold i like susie s idea well which idea be that stephen why didn t you notice what she say i d like to be god and be able to do thing yes he say after a moment s reflection that s a fine idea in the abstract but i doubt of it happiness in the long run doubt of it happiness come now what could there be well after all isn t it good enough to be god what more do you want the girl s tone be quizzical but her great black eye blaze with some think of sincerity which lay behind the fun the young man shake his head with a smile of kindly tolerance a he answer it isn t that surely you must know it i m ambitious enough goodness know but there be bound to satisfy even me but i m not sure that the good little thing isn t right she seem somehow to hit a big truth than she know fancy have to be just i don t see much difficulty in that anyone can be just pardon me he answer there be perhaps nothing so difficult in the whole range of a man s work there be distinct defiance in the girl s eye a she ask a man s work why a man s work isn t it a woman s work also well i suppose it ought to be theoretically practically it isn t and why not pray the mere suggestion of any disability of woman a such arouse immediate antagonism her companion suppress a smile a he answer deliberately because my dear stephen the almighty have ordain that justice be not a virtue woman can practise mind i do not say woman be unjust far from it where there be no interest of those dear to them they can be of a sincerity of justice that can make a man s blood run cold but justice in the abstract be not an ordinary virtue it have to be considerate a well a stern and above all interest of all kind and of every one the girl interrupt hotly i don t agree with you at all you can t give an instance where woman be unjust i don t mean of course individual instance but class of case where injustice be habitual the suppress smile crop out now unconsciously round the man s lip in a way which be intensely aggravate to the girl i ll give you a few he say do you ever know a mother just to a boy who beat her own boy at school the girl reply quietly ill treatment and bully be subject for punishment not justice oh i don t mean that kind of beat i mean get the prize their own boy contend for get above them in class show superior power in run or cricket or swim or in any of the form of effort in which boy vie with each other the girl reflect then she speak well you may be right i don t altogether admit it but i accept it a not on my side but this be only one case a pretty common one do you think that sheriff of galway who in default of a hangman hang his son with his own hand would have do so if he have be a woman the girl answer at once frankly no i don t suppose the mother be ever bear who would do such a thing but that be not a common case be it have you any other the young man pause before he speak there be another but i don t think i can go into it fairly with you why not well because after all you know stephen you be only a girl and you can t be expect to know the girl laugh well if it s anything about woman surely a girl even of my tender age must know something more of it or be able to guess at than any young man can however say what you think and i ll tell you frankly if i agree that be if a woman can be just in such a matter shortly the point be this can a woman be just to another woman or to a man for the matter of that where either her own affection or a fault of the other be concern i don t see any reason to the contrary surely pride alone should ensure justice in the former case and the consciousness of superiority in the other the young man shake his head pride and the consciousness of superiority be they not much the same thing but whether or no if either of them have to be rely on i m afraid the scale of justice would want regulate and her sword should be blunt in case it edge should be turn back on herself i have an idea that although pride might be a guide principle with you individually it would be a failure with the average however a it would be in any case a rule subject to many exception i must let it go harold look at his watch and rise stephen follow him transfer her whip into the hand which hold up the skirt she take his arm with her right hand in the pretty way in which a young girl cling to her elder together they go out at the lich gate the groom draw over with the horse stephen pat hers and give her a lump of sugar then put her foot into harold s ready hand she spring lightly into the saddle harold swing himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an accomplish rider a the two ride up the road keep on the shady side under the tree stephen say quietly half to herself a if the sentence have impress itself on her mind to be god and able to do thing harold ride on in silence the chill of some vague fear be upon him chapter i stephen stephen norman of normanstand have remain a bachelor until close on middle age when the fact take hold of him that there be no immediate heir to his great estate whereupon with his wonted decision he set about look for a wife he have be a close friend of his next neighbour squire rowly ever since their college day they have of course be often in each other s house and rowly s young sister almost a generation young than himself and the sole

constant opportunity which friendship give of close companionship the feel never alter squire norman would have be surprise have he be ask to describe margaret rowly and find himself compel to present the picture of a woman not a child now however when his thought go womanward and wifeward he awake to the fact that margaret come within the category of those he seek his usual decision run it course semi brotherly feel give place to a strong and perhaps more selfish feel before he even know it he be head over ear in love with his pretty neighbour norman be a fine man stalwart and handsome his forty year sit so lightly on him that his age never seem to come into question in a woman s mind margaret have always like him and trust him he be the big brother who have no duty in the way of scold to do his presence have always be a gladness and the sex of the girl first unconsciously then consciously answer to the man s overture and her consent be soon obtain when in the fulness of time it be know that an heir be expect squire norman take for grant that the child would be a boy and hold the idea so tenaciously that his wife who love him deeply give up warn and remonstrance after she have once try to caution him against too fond a hope she saw how bitterly he would be disappoint in case it should prove to be a girl he be however so fix on the point that she determine to say no more

would have a son the name be of course decide stephen have be the name of all the squire of normanstand for age a far back a the record go and stephen the new heir of course would be like all middle

his mind that it be not disturb even by his anxiety for the young wife he idolise when instead of a son a daughter be bear the doctor and the nurse who know his view on the subject hold back from the mother for a little the knowledge of the sex dame norman be so weak that the doctor fear lest anxiety a to how her husband would bear the disappointment might militate against her therefore the doctor seek the squire in his study and go resolutely at his task well squire i congratulate you on the birth of your child norman be of course strike with the use of the word child but the cause of his anxiety be manifest by his first question how be she doctor be she safe the child be after all of secondary importance the doctor breathe more freely the question have lighten his task there be

have use my opportunity on second think however i be glad the temptation be go i felt that it would be more delicate to learn what i want to know of miss trelawny s surround from herself rather than from her servant we bowl swiftly along knightsbridge the small noise of our well appoint vehicle sound hollowly in the morning air we turn up the kensington palace road and presently stop opposite a great house on the leave hand side near so far a i could judge the notting hill than the kensington end of the avenue it be a truly fine house not only with regard to size but to architecture even in the dim grey light of the morning which tend to diminish the size of thing it look big miss trelawny meet me in the hall she be not in any way shy she seem to rule all around her with a sort of high breed dominance all the more remarkable a she be greatly agitate and a pale a snow in the great hall be several servant the men stand together near the hall door and the woman cling together in the far corner and doorway a police superintendent have be talk to miss trelawny two men in uniform and one plain clothe man stand near him a she take my hand impulsively there be a look of relief in her eye and she give a gentle sigh of relief her salutation be simple i know you would come the clasp of the hand can mean a great deal even when it be not intend to mean anything especially miss trelawny s hand somehow become lose in my own it be not that it be a small hand it be fine and flexible with long delicate finger a rare and beautiful hand it be the unconscious self surrender and though at the moment i could not dwell on the cause of the thrill which sweep me it come back to me late she turn and say to the police superintendent this be mr malcolm ross the police officer salute a he answer i know mr malcolm ross miss perhaps he will remember i have the honour of work with him in the brixton coin case i have not at first glance notice who it be my whole attention have be take with miss trelawny of course superintendent dolan i remember very well i say a we shake hand i could not but note that the acquaintanceship seem a relief to miss trelawny there be a certain vague uneasiness in her manner which take my attention instinctively i felt that it would be less embarrass for her to speak with me alone so i say to the superintendent perhaps it will be well if miss trelawny will see me alone for a few minute you of course have already hear all she know and i shall understand well how thing be if i may ask some question i will then talk the matter over with you if i may i shall be glad to be of what service i can sir he answer heartily follow miss trelawny i move over to a dainty room which open from the hall and look out on the garden at the back of the house when we have enter and i have close the door she say i will thank you late for your goodness in come to me in my trouble but at present you can best help me when you know the fact go on i say tell me all you know and spare no detail however trivial it may at the present time seem to be she go on at once i be awaken by some sound i do not know what i only know that it come through my sleep for all at once i find myself awake with my heart beat wildly listen anxiously for some sound from my father s room my room be next father s and i can often hear him move about before i fall asleep he work late at night sometimes very late indeed so that when i wake early a i do occasionally or in the grey of the dawn i hear him still move i try once to remonstrate with him about stay up so late a it can not be good for him but i never venture to repeat the experiment you know how stern and cold he can be at least you may remember what i tell you about him and when he be polite in this mood he be dreadful when he be angry i can bear it much well but when he be slow and deliberate and the side of his mouth lift up to show the sharp teeth i think i feel well i don t know how last night i get up softly and steal to the door for i really fear to disturb him there be not any noise of move and no kind of cry at all but there be a queer kind of drag sound and a slow heavy breathe oh it be dreadful wait there in the dark and the silence and fear fear i do not know what at last i take my courage a deux main and turn the handle a softly a i could i open the door a tiny bit it be quite dark within i could just see the outline of the window but in the darkness the sound of breathe become more distinct be appal a i listen this continue but there be no other sound i push the door open all at once i be afraid to open it slowly i felt a if there might be some dreadful thing behind it ready to pounce out on me then i switch on the electric light and step into the room i look first at the bed the sheet be all crumple up so that i know father have be in bed but there be a great dark red patch in the centre of the bed and spread to the edge of it that make my heart stand still a i be gaze at it the sound of the breathe come across the room and my eye follow to it there be father on his right side with the other arm under him just a if his dead body have be throw there all in a heap the track of blood go across the room up to the bed and there be a pool all around him which look terribly red and glitter a i bend over to examine him the place where he lay be right in front of the big safe he be in his pyjama the leave sleeve be tear show his bare arm and stretch out toward the safe it look oh so terrible patch all with blood and with the flesh tear or cut all around a gold chain bangle on his wrist i do not know he wear such a thing and it seem to give me a new shock of surprise she pause a moment and a i wish to relieve her by a moment s divergence of think i say oh that need not surprise you you will see the most unlikely men wear bangle i have see a judge condemn a man to death and the wrist of the hand he hold up have a gold bangle she do not seem to heed much the word or the idea the pause however relieve her somewhat and she go on in a steady voice i do not lose a moment in summon aid for i fear he might bleed to death i ring the bell and then go out and call for help a loudly a i could in what must have be a very short time though it seem an incredibly long one to me some of the servant come run up and then others till the room seem full of star eye and dishevel hair and night clothe of all sort we lift father on a sofa and the housekeeper mr grant who seem to have her wit about her more than any of u begin to look where the flow of blood come from in a few second it become apparent that it come from the arm which be bare there be a deep wind not clean cut a with a knife but like a jag rent or tear close to the wrist which seem to have cut into the vein mr grant tie a handkerchief round the cut and screw it up tight with a silver paper cutter and the flow of blood seem to be check at once by this time i have come to my sens or such of them a remain and i send off one man for the doctor and another for the police when they have go i felt that except for the servant i be all alone in the house and that i know nothing of my father or anything else and a great longing come to me to have someone with me who could help me then i think of you and your kind offer in the boat under the willow tree and without wait to think i tell the men to get a carriage ready at once and i scribble a note and send it on to you she pause i do not like to say just

of the captain then on the bridge be call by the look out man to a tiny float light close inshore it be the custom of some south go ship to run close to the spear of ivan in fine weather a the water be deep and there be no settle current also there be no outlying rock indeed some year ago the local steamer have become accustom to hug the shore here so closely that an intimation be send from lloyd s that any mischance under the circumstance would not be include in ordinary sea risk captain mirolani be one of those who insist on a wholesome distance from the promontory be keep but on his attention have be call to the circumstance report he think it well to investigate it a it might be some case of personal distress accordingly he have the engine slow down and edge cautiously in towards shore he be join on the bridge by two of his officer signior falamano and destilia and by one passenger on board mr peter caulfield whose report of spiritual phenomenon in remote place be well know to the reader of the journal of occultism the follow account of the strange occurrence write by him and attest by the signature of captain mirolani and the other gentleman name have be send to u it be eleven minute before twelve midnight on saturday the th day of january when i saw the strange sight off the headland know a the spear of ivan on the coast of the land of the blue mountain it be a fine night and i stand right on the bow of the ship where there be nothing to obstruct my view we be some distance from the spear of ivan pass from northern to southern point of the wide bay into which it project captain mirolani the master be a very careful seaman and give on his journey a wide berth to the bay which be taboo by lloyd s but when he saw in the moonlight though far off a tiny white figure of a woman drift on some strange current in a small boat on the prow of which rest a faint light to me it look like a corpse candle he think it might be some person in distress and begin to cautiously edge towards it two of his officer be with him on the bridge signior falamano and destilia all these three a well a myself saw it the rest of the crew and passenger be below a we get close the true inwardness of it become apparent to me but the mariner do not seem to realize till the very last this be after all not strange for none of them have either knowledge or experience in occult matter whereas for over thirty year i have make a special study of this subject and have go to and fro over the earth investigate to the nth all record of spiritual phenomenon a i could see from their movement that the officer do not comprehend that which be so apparent to myself i take care not to enlighten them lest such should result in the change of the vessel s course before i should be near enough to make accurate observation all turn out a i wish at least nearly so a shall be see be in the bow i have of course a well view than from the bridge presently i make out that the boat which have all along seem to be of a queer shape be none other than a coffin and that the woman stand up in it be clothe in a shroud her back be towards u and she have evidently not hear our approach a we be creep along slowly the engine be almost noiseless and there be hardly a ripple a our fore foot cut the dark water suddenly there be a wild cry from the bridge italian be certainly very excitable hoarse command be give to the quartermaster at the wheel the engine room bell clang on the instant a it seem the ship s head begin to swing round to starboard full steam ahead be in action and before one could understand the apparition be fade in the distance the last thing i saw be the flash of a white face with dark burn eye a the figure sink down into the coffin just a mist or smoke disappear under a breeze book i the will of roger melton the read of the will of roger melton and all that follow record make by ernest roger halbard melton law student of the inner temple eldest son of ernest halbard melton eldest son of ernest melton elder brother of the say roger melton and his next of kin i consider it at least useful perhaps necessary to have a complete and accurate record of all pertain to the will of my late grand uncle roger melton to which end let me put down the various member of his family and explain some of their occupation and idiosyncrasy my father ernest halbard melton be the only son of ernest melton eldest son of sir geoffrey halbard melton of humcroft in the shire of salop a justice of the peace and at one time sheriff my great grandfather sir geoffrey have inherit a small estate from his father roger melton in his time by the way the name be spell milton but my great great grandfather change the spell to the late form a he be a practical man not give to sentiment and fear lest he should in the public eye be confuse with others belong to the family of a radical person call milton who write poetry and be some sort of official in the time of cromwell whilst we be conservative the same practical spirit which originate the change in the spell of the family name incline him to go into business so he become whilst still young a tanner and leather dresser he utilize for the purpose the pond and stream and also the oak wood on his estate torraby in suffolk he make a fine business and accumulate a considerable fortune with a part of which he purchase the shropshire estate which he entail and to which i be therefore heir apparent sir geoffrey have in addition to my grandfather three son and a daughter the latter be bear twenty year after her young brother these son be geoffrey who die without issue have be kill in the indian mutiny at meerut in at which he take up a sword though a civilian to fight for his life roger to whom i shall refer presently and john the latter like geoffrey die unmarried out of sir geoffrey s family of five therefore only three have to be consider my grandfather who have three child two of whom a son and a daughter die young leave only my father roger and patience patience who be bear in marry an irishman of the name of sellenger which be the usual way of pronounce the name of st leger or a they spell it send leger restore by late generation to the still old form he be a reckless dare devil sort of fellow then a captain in the lancer a man not without the quality of bravery he win the victoria cross at the battle of amoaful in the ashantee campaign but i fear he lack the seriousness and steadfast strenuous purpose which my father always say mark the character of our own family he run through nearly all of his patrimony never a very large one and have it not be for my grand aunt s little fortune his day have he live must have end in comparative poverty comparative not actual for the meltons who be person of considerable pride would not have tolerate a poverty stricken branch of the family we don t think much of that lot any of u fortunately my great aunt patience have only one child and the premature decease of captain st leger a i prefer to call the name do not allow of the possibility of her have more she do not marry again though my grandmother try several time to arrange an alliance for her she be i be tell always a stiff uppish person who would not yield herself to the wisdom of her superior her own child be a son who seem to take his character rather from his father s family than from my own he be a wastrel and a roll stone always in scrap at school and always want to do ridiculous thing my father a head of the house and his own senior by eighteen year try often to admonish him but his perversity of spirit and his truculence be such that he have to desist indeed i have hear my father say that he sometimes threaten his life a desperate character he be and almost devoid of reverence no one not even my father have any influence good influence of course i mean over him except his mother who be of my family and also a woman who live with her a sort of govern aunt he call her the way of it be this captain st leger have a young brother who make an improvident marriage with a scotch girl when they be both very young they have nothing to live on except what the reckless lancer give them for he have next to nothing himself and she be bare which be i understand the indelicate scottish way of express lack of fortune she be however i understand of an old and somewhat good family though break in fortune to use an expression which however could hardly be use precisely in regard to a family or a person who never have fortune to be break in it be so far well that the mackelpies that be the maiden name of mr st leger be reputable so far a fight be concern it would have be too humiliate to have allied to our family even on the distaff side a family both poor and of no account fight alone do not make a family i think soldier be not everything though they think they be we have have in our family men who fight but i never hear of any of them who fight because they want to mr st leger have a sister fortunately there be only those two child in the family or else they would all have have to be support by the money of my family mr st leger who be only a subaltern be kill at maiwand and his wife be leave a beggar fortunately however she die her sister spread a story that it be from the shock and grief before the child which she expect be bear this all happen when my cousin or rather my father s cousin my first cousin once remove to be accurate be still a very small child his mother then send for miss mackelpie her brother in law s sister in law to come and live with her which she do beggar can t be chooser and she help to bring up young st leger i remember once my father give me a sovereign for make a witty remark about her i be quite a boy then not more than thirteen but our family be always clever from the very begin of life and father be tell me about the st leger family my family hadn t of course see anything of them since captain st leger die the circle to which we belong don t care for poor relation and be explain where miss mackelpie come in she must have be a sort of nursery govern for mr st leger once tell him that she help her to educate the child then father i say if she help to educate the child she ought to have be call miss macskelpie when my first cousin once remove rupert be twelve year old his mother die and he be in the dolefuls about it for more than a year miss mackelpie keep on live with him all the same catch her quit that sort don t go into the poor house when they can keep out my father be head of the family be of course one of the trustee and his uncle roger brother of the testator another the third be general mackelpie a poverty stricken scotch laird who have a lot of valueless land at croom in ross shire i remember father give me a new ten pound note when i interrupt him whilst he be tell me of the incident of young st leger s improvidence by remark that he be in error a to the land from what i have hear of mackelpie s estate it be productive of one thing when he ask me what i answer mortgage father i know have buy not long before a lot of them at what a college friend of mine from chicago use to call cut throat price when i remonstrate with my father for buy them at all and so injure the family estate which i be to inherit he give me an answer the astuteness of which i have never forget i do it so that i might keep my hand on the bold general in case he should ever prove troublesome and if the worst should ever come to the worst croom be a good country for grouse and stag my father can see a far a most men when my cousin i shall call him cousin henceforth in this record lest it might seem to any unkind person who might hereafter read it that i wish to taunt rupert st leger with his somewhat obscure position in reiterate his real distance in kinship with my family when my cousin rupert st leger wish to commit a certain idiotic act of financial folly he approach my father on the subject arrive at our estate humcroft at an inconvenient time without permission not have have even the decent courtesy to say he be come i be then a little chap of six year old but i could not help notice his mean appearance he be all dusty and dishevel when my father saw him i come into the study with him he say in a horrify voice good god he be far shock when the boy brusquely acknowledge in reply to my father s greet that he have travel third class of course none of my family ever go anything but first class even the servant go second my father be really angry when he say he have walk up from the station a nice spectacle for my tenant and my tradesman to see my my a kinsman of my house howsoever remote

father i walk sir because i have no money but i assure you i do not mean to be insolent i simply come here because i wish to ask your advice and assistance not because you be an important person and have a long avenue a i know to my cost but simply because you be one of my trustee your trustee sirrah say my father interrupt him your trustee i beg your pardon sir he say quite quietly i mean the trustee of my dear mother s will and what may i ask you say father do you want in the way of advice from one of the trustee of your dear mother s will rupert get very red and be go to say something rude i know it from his look but he stop and say in the same gentle way i want your advice sir a to the best way of do something which i wish to do and a i be under age can not do myself it must be do through the trustee of my mother s will and the assistance for which you wish say father put his hand in his pocket i know what that action mean when i be talk to him the assistance i want say rupert

33,bramStoker_draculaGuest,bram_stoker,57971,﻿ when we start for our drive the sun be shin brightly on munich and the air be full of the joyousness of early summer just a we be about to depart herr delbrück the maître d hôtel of the quatre saisons where i be stay come down bareheaded to the carriage and after wish me a pleasant drive say to the coachman still hold his hand on the handle of the carriage door remember you be back by nightfall the sky look bright but there be a shiver in the north wind that say there may be a sudden storm but i be sure you will not be late here he smile and add for you know what night it be johann answer with an emphatic ja mein herr and touch his hat drive off quickly when we have clear the town i say after signal to him to stop tell me johann what be tonight he cross himself a he answer laconically walpurgis nacht then he take out his watch a great old fashion german silver thing a big a a turnip and look at it with his eyebrow gather together and a little impatient shrug of his shoulder i realise that this be his way of respectfully protest against the unnecessary delay and sink back in the carriage merely motion him to proceed he start off rapidly a if to make up for lose time every now and then the horse seem to throw up their head and sniff the air suspiciously on such occasion i often look round in alarm the road be pretty bleak for we be traverse a sort of high wind sweep plateau a we drive i saw a road that look but little use and which seem to dip through a little wind valley it look so invite that even at the risk of offend him i call johann to stop and when he have pull up i tell him i would like to drive down that road he make all sort of excuse and frequently cross himself a he speak this somewhat pique my curiosity so i ask him various question he answer fencingly and repeatedly look at his watch in protest finally i say well johann i want to go down this road i shall not ask you to come unless you like but tell me why you do not like to go that be all i ask for answer he seem to throw himself off the box so quickly do he reach the grind then he stretch out his hand appealingly to me and implore me not to go there be just enough of english mix with the german for me to understand the drift of his talk he seem always just about to tell me something the very idea of which evidently frighten him but each time he pull himself up say a he cross himself walpurgis nacht i try to argue with him but it be difficult to argue with a man when i do not know his language the advantage certainly rest with him for although he begin to speak in english of a very crude and break kind he always get excite and break into his native tongue and every time he do so he look at his watch then the horse become restless and sniff the air at this he grow very pale and look around in a frighten way he suddenly jump forward take them by the bridle and lead them on some twenty foot i follow and ask why he have do this for answer he cross himself point to the spot we have leave and draw his carriage in the direction of the other road indicate a cross and say first in german then in english bury him him what kill themselves i remember the old custom of bury suicide at cross road ah i see a suicide how interest but for the life of me i could not make out why the horse be frighten whilst we be talk we hear a sort of sound between a yelp and a bark it be far away but the horse get very restless and it take johann all his time to quiet them he be pale and say it sound like a wolf but yet there be no wolf here now no i say question him isn t it long since the wolf be so near the city long long he answer in the spring and summer but with the snow the wolf have be here not so long whilst he be pet the horse and try to quiet them dark cloud drift rapidly across the sky the sunshine pass away and a breath of cold wind seem to drift past u it be only a breath however and more in the nature of a warn than a fact for the sun come out brightly again johann look under his lift hand at the horizon and say the storm of snow he come before long time then he look at his watch again and straightway hold his rein firmly for the horse be still paw the grind restlessly and shake their head he climb to his box a though the time have come for proceed on our journey i felt a little obstinate and do not at once get into the carriage tell me i say about this place where the road lead and i point down again he cross himself and mumble a prayer before he answer it be unholy what be unholy i enquire the village then there be a village no no no one life there hundred of year my curiosity be pique but you say there be a village there be where be it now whereupon he burst out into a long story in german and english so mix up that i could not quite understand exactly what he say but roughly i gather that long ago hundred of year men have die there and be bury in their graf and sound be hear under the clay and when the graf be open men and woman be find rosy with life and their mouth red with blood and so in haste to save their life aye and their soul and here he cross himself those who be leave flee away to other place where the live live and the dead be dead and not not something he be evidently afraid to speak the last word a he proceed with his narration he grow more and more excite it seem a if his imagination have get hold of him and he end in a perfect paroxysm of fear white face perspire trembling and look round him a if expect that some dreadful presence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the open plain finally in an agony of desperation he cry walpurgis nacht and point to the carriage for me to get in all my english blood rise at this and stand back i say you be afraid johann you be afraid go home i shall return alone the walk will do me good the carriage door be open i take from the seat my oak walk stick which i always carry on my holiday excursion and close the door point back to munich and say go home johann walpurgis nacht doesn t concern englishman the horse be now more restive than ever and johann be try to hold them in while excitedly implore me not to do anything so foolish i pity the poor fellow he be deeply in earnest but all the same i could not help laugh his english be quite go now in his anxiety he have forget that his only mean of make me understand be to talk my language so he jabber away in his native german it begin to be a little tedious after give the direction home i turn to go down the cross road into the valley with a despair gesture johann turn his horse towards munich i lean on my stick and look after him he go slowly along the road for a while then there come over the crest of the hill a man tall and thin i could see so much in the distance when he draw near the horse they begin to jump and kick about then to scream with terror johann could not hold them in they bolt down the road run away madly i watch them out of sight then look for the stranger but i find that he too be go with a light heart i turn down the side road through the deepen valley to which johann have object there be not the slight reason that i could see for his objection and i daresay i tramp for a couple of hour without think of time or distance and certainly without see a person or a house so far a the place be concern it be desolation itself but i do not notice this particularly till on turn a bend in the road i come upon a scatter fringe of wood then i recognise that i have be impress unconsciously by the desolation of the region through which i have pass i sit down to rest myself and begin to look around it strike me that it be considerably cold than it have be at the commencement of my walk a sort of sigh sound seem to be around me with now and then high overhead a sort of muffle roar look upwards i notice that great thick cloud be drift rapidly across the sky from north to south at a great height there be sign of come storm in some lofty stratum of the air i be a little chilly and think that it be the sit still after the exercise of walk i resume my journey the grind i pass over be now much more picturesque there be no strike object that the eye might single out but in all there be a charm of beauty i take little heed of time and it be only when the deepen twilight force itself upon me that i begin to think of how i should find my way home the brightness of the day have go the air be cold and the drift of cloud high overhead be more mark they be accompany by a sort of far away rush sound through which seem to come at interval that mysterious cry which the driver have say come from a wolf for a while i hesitate i have say i would see the desert village so on i go and presently come on a wide stretch of open country shut in by hill all around their side be cover with tree which spread down to the plain dot in clump the gentler slop and hollow which show here and there i follow with my eye the wind of the road and saw that it curve close to one of the densest of these clump and be lose behind it a i look there come a cold shiver in the air and the snow begin to fall i think of the mile and mile of bleak country i have pass and then hurry on to seek the shelter of the wood in front dark and dark grow the sky and fast and heavy fell the snow till the earth before and around me be a glisten white carpet the far edge of which be lose in misty vagueness the road be here but crude and when on the level it boundary be not so mark a when it pass through the cutting and in a little while i find that i must have stray from it for i miss underfoot the hard surface and my foot sink deep in the grass and moss then the wind grow strong and blow with ever increase force till i be fain to run before it the air become icy cold and in spite of my exercise i begin to suffer the snow be now fall so thickly and whirl around me in such rapid eddy that i could hardly keep my eye open every now and then the heaven be tear asunder by vivid lightning and in the flash i could see ahead of me a great mass of tree chiefly yew and cypress all heavily coat with

of the night by and by the storm seem to be pass away it now only come in fierce puff or blast at such moment the weird sound of the wolf appear to be echo by many similar sound around me now and again through the black mass of drift cloud come a straggle ray of moonlight which light up the expanse and show me that i be at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew tree a the snow have cease to fall i walk out from the shelter and begin to investigate more closely it appear to me that amongst so many old foundation a i have pass there might be still stand a house in which though in ruin i could find some sort of shelter for a while a i skirt the edge of the copse i find that a low wall encircle it and follow this i presently find an opening here the cypress form an alley lead up to a square mass of some kind of build just a i catch sight of this however the drift cloud obscure the moon and i pass up the path in darkness the wind must have grow cold for i felt myself shiver a i walk but there be hope of shelter and i grope my way blindly on i stop for there be a sudden stillness the storm have pass and perhaps in sympathy with nature s silence my heart seem to cease to beat but this be only momentarily for suddenly the moonlight break through the cloud show me that i be in a graveyard and that the square object before me be a great massive tomb of marble a white a the snow that lay on and all around it with the moonlight there come a fierce sigh of the storm which appear to resume it course with a long low howl a of many dog or wolf i be awe and shock and felt the cold perceptibly grow upon me till it seem to grip me by the heart then while the flood of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb the storm give far evidence of renew a though it be return on it

dolingen of gratz in styria seek and find death on the top of the tomb seemingly drive through the solid marble for the structure be compose of a few vast block of stone be a great iron spike or stake on go to the back i saw grave in great russian letter the dead travel fast there be something so weird and uncanny about the whole thing that it give me a turn and make me feel quite faint i begin to wish for the first time that i have take johann s advice here a think strike me which come under almost mysterious circumstance and with a terrible shock this be walpurgis night walpurgis night when accord to the belief of million of people the devil be abroad when the graf be open and the dead come forth and walk when all evil thing of earth and air and water hold revel this very place the driver have specially shun this be the depopulate village of century ago this be where the suicide lay and this be the place where i be alone unman shiver with cold in a shroud of snow with a wild storm gather again upon me it take all my philosophy all the religion i have be teach all my courage not to collapse in a paroxysm of fright and now a perfect tornado burst upon me the grind shake a though thousand of horse thunder across it and this time the storm bore on it icy wing not snow but great hailstone which drive with such violence that they might have come from the thong of balearic slinger hailstone that beat down leaf and branch and make the shelter of the cypress of no more avail than though their stem be stand corn at the first i have rush to the near tree but i be soon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seem to afford refuge the deep doric doorway of the marble tomb there crouch against the massive bronze door i gain a certain amount of protection from the beat of the hailstone for now they only drive against me a they ricochet from the grind and the side of the marble a i lean against the door it move slightly and open inwards the shelter of even a tomb be welcome in that pitiless tempest and i be about to enter it when there come a flash of fork lightning that light up the whole expanse of the heaven in the instant a i be a live man i saw a my eye be turn into the darkness of the tomb a beautiful woman with round cheek and red lip seemingly sleeping on a bier a the thunder break overhead i be grasp a by the hand of a giant and hurl out into the

make of the same amount of study on the very spot where we be go be in the real heart of the old kingdom of mercia where there be trace of all the various nationality which make up the conglomerate which become britain i rather gather that you have some more definite more personal reason for my hurry after all history can keep except in the make quite right my boy i have a reason such a you very wisely guess i be anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local history occur what be that if i may ask sir certainly the principal landowner of our part of the county be on his way home and there will be a great home come which you may care to see the fact be for more than a century the various owner in the succession here with the exception of a short time have live abroad how be that sir if i may ask the great house and estate in our part of the world be castra regis the family seat of the caswall family the last owner who live here be edgar caswall grandfather of the man who be come here and he be the only one who stay even a short time this man s grandfather also name edgar they keep the tradition of the family christian name quarrel with his family and go to live abroad not keep up any intercourse good or bad with his relative although this particular edgar a i tell you do visit his family estate yet his son be bear and live and die abroad while his grandson the late inheritor be also bear and live abroad till he be over thirty his present age this be the second line of absentee the great estate of castra regis have have no knowledge of it owner for five generation cover more than a hundred and twenty year it have be well administer however and no tenant or other connect with it have have anything of which to complain all the same there have be much natural anxiety to see the new owner and we be all excite about the event of his come even i be though i own my own estate which though adjacent be quite apart from castra regis here we be now in new grind for you that be the spire of salisbury cathedral and when we leave that we shall be get close to the old roman county and you will naturally want your eye so we shall shortly have to keep our mind on old mercia however you need not be disappoint my old friend sir nathaniel de salis who like myself be a free holder near castra regis his estate doom tower be over the border of derbyshire on the peak be come to stay with me for the festivity to welcome edgar caswall he be just the sort of man you will like he be devote to history and be president of the mercian archaeological society he know more of our own part of the country with it history and it people than anyone else i expect he will have arrive before u and we three can have a long chat after dinner he be also our local geologist and natural historian so you and he will have many interest in common amongst other thing he have a special knowledge of the peak and it cavern and know all the old legend of prehistoric time they spend the night at cheltenham and on the follow morning resume their journey to stafford adam s eye be in constant employment and it be not till salton declare that they have now enter on the last stage of their journey that he refer to sir nathaniel s come a the dusk be close down they drive on to less hill mr salton s house it be now too dark to see any detail of their surround adam could just see that it be on the top of a hill not quite so high a that which be cover by the castle on whose tower fly the flag and which be all ablaze with move light manifestly use in the preparation for the festivity on the morrow so adam defer his curiosity till daylight his grand uncle be meet at the door by a fine old man who greet him warmly i come over early a you wish i suppose this be your grand nephew i be glad to meet you mr adam salton i be nathaniel de salis and your uncle be one of my old friend adam from the moment of their eye meet felt a if they be already friend

the world who have travel much and within a certain area study deeply he be a brilliant conversationalist a be to be expect from a successful diplomatist even under unstimulating condition but he have

out one or two straw that have find their way into rent in his clothe and draw a well wear cap over his uncombed lock he be all ready for the business of the day dick s appearance a he stand beside the box be rather peculiar his pant be tear in several place and have apparently belong in the first instance to a boy two size large than himself he wear a vest all the button of which be go except two out of which peep a shirt which look a if it have be wear a month to complete his costume he wear a coat too long for him date back if one might judge from it general appearance to a remote antiquity wash the face and hand be usually consider proper in commence the day but dick be above such refinement he have no particular dislike to dirt and do not think it necessary to remove several dark streak on his face and hand but in spite of his dirt and rag there be something about dick that be attractive it be easy to see that if he have be clean and well dress he would have be decidedly good look some of his companion be sly and their face inspire distrust but dick have a frank straight forward manner that make him a favorite dick s business hour have commence he have no office to open his little blacking box be ready for use and he look sharply in the face of all who pass address each with shine yer boot sir how much ask a gentleman on his way to his office ten cent say dick drop his box and sink upon his knee on the sidewalk flourish his brush with the air of one skilled in his profession ten cent isn t that a little steep well you know taint all clear profit say dick who have already set to work there s the blacking cost something and i have to get a new brush pretty often and you have a large rent too say the gentleman quizzically with a glance at a large hole in dick s coat yes sir say dick always ready to joke i have to pay such a big rent for my manshun up on fifth avenoo that i can t afford to take less than ten cent a shine i ll give you a bully shine sir be quick about it for i be in a hurry so your house be on fifth avenue be it it isn t anywhere else say dick and dick speak the truth there what tailor do you patronize ask the gentleman survey dick s attire would you like to go to the same one ask dick shrewdly well no it strike me that he didn t give you a very good fit this coat once belong to general washington say dick comically he wear it all through the revolution and it get tear some cause he fit so hard when he die he tell his widder to give it to some smart young feller that hadn t get none of his own so she give it to me but if you d like it sir to remember general washington by i ll let you have it reasonable thank you but i wouldn t want to deprive you of it and do your pant come from general washington too no they be a gift from lewis napoleon lewis have outgrow em and send em to me he s big than me and that s why they don t fit it seem you have distinguish friend now my lad i suppose you would like your money i shouldn

any time during the day all right sir where be it no fulton street shall you remember yes sir what name greyson office on second floor all right sir i ll bring it i wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest say mr greyson to himself a he walk away if he do i ll give him my custom regularly if he don t a be most likely i shan t mind the loss of fifteen cent mr greyson didn t understand dick our rag hero wasn t a model boy in all respect i be afraid he swear sometimes and now and then he play trick upon unsophisticated boy from the country or give a wrong direction to honest old gentleman unused to the city a clergyman in search of the cooper institute he once direct to the tomb prison and follow him unobserved be highly delight when the unsuspicious stranger walk up the front step of the great stone build on centre street and try to obtain admission i guess he wouldn t want to stay long if he do get in think rag dick hitch up his pant leastways i shouldn t they re so precious glad to see you that they win t let you go but board you gratooitous and never send in no bill another of dick s fault be his extravagance be always wide awake and ready for business he earn enough to have support him comfortably and respectably there be not a few young clerk who employ dick from time to time in his professional capacity who scarcely earn a much a he greatly a their style and dress exceed his but dick be careless of his earnings where they go he could hardly have tell himself however much he manage to earn during the day all be generally spend before morning he be fond of go to the old bowery theatre and to tony pastor s and if he have any money leave afterwards he would invite some of his friend in somewhere to have an oyster stew so it seldom happen that he commence the day with a penny then i be sorry to add that dick have form the habit of smoking this cost him considerable for dick be rather fastidious about his cigar and wouldn t smoke the cheap besides have a liberal nature he be generally ready to treat his companion but of course the expense be the small objection no boy of fourteen can smoke without be affect injuriously men be frequently injure by smoking and boy always but large number of the newsboy and boot black form the habit expose to the cold and wet they find that it warm them up and the self indulgence grow upon them it be not uncommon to see a little boy too young to be out of his mother s sight smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker there be another way in which dick sometimes lose money there be a note gamble house on baxter street which in the evening be sometimes crowd with these juvenile gamesters who stake their hard earnings generally lose of course and refresh themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cent a glass sometimes dick stray in here and play with the rest i have mention dick s fault and defect because i want it understand to begin with that i don t consider him a model boy but there be some good point about him nevertheless he be above do anything mean or dishonorable he would not steal or cheat or impose upon young boy but be frank and straight forward manly and self reliant his nature be a noble one and have save him from all mean fault i hope my young reader will like him a i do without be blind to his fault perhaps although he be only a boot black they may find something in him to imitate and now have fairly introduce rag dick to my young reader i must refer them to the next chapter for his far adventure chapter ii johnny nolan after dick have finish polish mr greyson s boot he be fortunate enough to secure three other customer two of them reporter in the tribune establishment which occupy the corner of spruce street and printing house square when dick have get through with his last customer the city hall clock indicate eight o clock he have be up an hour and hard at work and naturally begin to think of breakfast he go up to the head of spruce street and turn into nassau two block far and he reach ann street on this street be a small cheap restaurant where for five cent dick could get a cup of coffee and for ten cent more a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread throw in these dick order and sit down at a table it be a small apartment with a few plain table unprovided with cloth for the class of customer who patronize it be not very particular our hero s breakfast be soon before him neither the coffee nor the steak be a good a can be buy at delmonico s but then it be very doubtful whether in the present state of his wardrobe dick would have be receive at that aristocratic restaurant even if his mean have admit of pay the high price there charge dick have scarcely be serve when he espy a boy about his own size stand at the door look wistfully into the restaurant this be johnny nolan a boy of fourteen who be engage in the same profession a rag dick his wardrobe be in very much the same condition a dick s have your breakfast johnny inquire dick cut off a piece of steak no come in then here s room for you i aint get no money say johnny look a little enviously at his more fortunate friend haven t you have any shin yes i have one but i shan t get any pay till to morrow be you hungry try me and see come in i ll stand treat this morning johnny nolan be nowise slow to accept this invitation and be soon seat beside dick what ll you have johnny same a you cup o coffee and beefsteak order dick these be promptly bring and johnny attack them vigorously now in the boot blacking business a well a in high avocation the same rule prevail that energy and industry be reward and indolence suffer dick be energetic and on the alert for business but johnny the reverse the consequence be that dick earn probably three time a much a the other how do you like it ask dick survey johnny s attack upon the steak with evident complacency it s hunky i don t believe hunky be to be find in either webster s or worcester s big dictionary but boy will readily understand what it mean do you come here often ask johnny most every day you d well come too i can t afford it well you d ought to then say dick what do you do i d like to know i don t get near a much a you dick well you might if you try i keep my eye open that s the way i get job you re lazy that s what s the matter johnny do not see fit to reply to this charge probably he felt the justice of it and prefer to proceed with the breakfast which he enjoy the more a it cost him nothing breakfast over dick walk up to the desk and settle the bill then follow by johnny he go out into the street where be you go johnny up to mr taylor s on spruce street to see if he don t want a shine do you work for him reg lar yes him and his partner want a shine most every day where be you goin down front of the astor house i guess i ll find some customer there at this moment johnny start and dodging into an entry way hide behind the door considerably to dick s surprise what s the matter now ask our hero have he go ask johnny his voice betray anxiety who go i d like to know that man in the brown coat what of him you aint scar of him be you yes he get me a place once where ever so far off what if he do i run away didn t you like it no i have to get up too early it be on a farm and i have to get up at five to take care of the cow i like new york best didn t they give you enough to eat oh yes plenty and you have a good bed yes then you d well have stay you don t get either of them here where d you sleep last night up an alley in an old wagon you have a well bed than that in the country didn t you yes it be a soft a a cotton johnny have once sleep on a bale of cotton the recollection supply him with a comparison why didn t you stay i felt lonely say johnny johnny could not exactly explain his feel but it be often the case that the young vagabond of the street though his food be uncertain and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he be lucky enough to find unoccupied when night set in get so attach to his precarious but independent mode of life that he feel discontent in any other he be accustom to the noise and bustle and ever vary life of the street and in the quiet scene of the country miss the excitement in the midst of which he have always dwell johnny have but

house which tom ’ s father live in wa up a foul little pocket call offal court out of pudding lane it wa small decay and rickety but it wa pack full of wretchedly poor family canty ’ s tribe occupy a room on the third floor the mother and father have a sort of bedstead in the corner but tom his grandmother and his two sister bet and nan be not restrict they have all the floor to themselves and might sleep where they choose there be the remain of a blanket or two and some bundle of ancient and dirty straw but these could not rightly be call bed for they be not organise they be kick into a general pile morning and selection make from the mass at night for service bet and nan be fifteen year old twin they be good hearted girl unclean clothe in rag and profoundly ignorant their mother wa like them but the father and the grandmother be a couple of fiend they get drink whenever they could then they fight each other or anybody else who come in the way they curse and swear always drink or sober john canty wa a thief and his mother a beggar they make beggar of the child but fail to make thief of them among but not of the dreadful rabble that inhabit the house wa a good old priest whom the king have turn out of house and home with a pension of a few farthing and he use to get the child aside and teach them right way secretly father andrew also teach tom a little latin and how to read and write and would have do the same with the girl but they be afraid of the jeer of their friend who could not have endure such a queer accomplishment in them all offal court wa just such another hive a canty ’ s house drunkenness riot and brawl be the order there every night and nearly all night long break head be a common a hunger in that place yet little tom wa not unhappy he have a hard time of it but do not know it it wa the sort of time that all the offal court boy have therefore he suppose it wa the correct and comfortable thing when he come home empty hand at night he know his father would curse him and thrash him first and that when he wa do the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it and that away in the night his starve mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she have be able to save for him by go hungry herself notwithstanding she wa often catch in that sort of treason and soundly beat for it by her husband no tom ’ s life go along well enough especially in summer he only beg just enough to save himself for the law against mendicancy be stringent and the penalty heavy so he put in a good deal of his time listen to good father andrew ’ s charm old tale and legend about giant and fairy dwarf and genius and enchant castle and gorgeous king and prince his head grow to be full of these wonderful thing and many a night a he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw tire hungry and smarting from a thrash he unleash his imagination and soon forget his ache and pain in delicious picturing to himself of the charm life of a pet prince in a regal palace one desire come in time to haunt him day and night it wa to see a real prince with his own eye he speak of it once to some of his offal court comrade but they jeer him and scoff him so unmercifully that he wa glad to keep his dream to himself after that he often read the priest ’ s old book and get him to explain and enlarge upon them his dreaming and read work certain change in him by and by his dream people be so fine that he grow to lament his shabby clothe and his dirt and to wish to be clean and well clothe he go on play in the mud just the same and enjoy it too but instead of splash around in the thames solely for the fun of it he begin to find an add value in it because of the wash and cleanse it afford tom could always find something go on around the maypole in cheapside and at the fair and now and then he and the rest of london have a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate wa carry prisoner to the tower by land or boat one summer ’ s day he saw poor anne askew and three men burn at the stake in smithfield and hear an ex bishop preach a sermon to them which do not interest him yes tom ’ s life wa vary and pleasant enough on the whole by and by tom ’ s read and dreaming about princely life work such a strong effect upon him that he begin to act the prince unconsciously his speech and manner become curiously ceremonious and courtly to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimate but tom ’ s influence among these young people begin to grow now day by day and in time he come to be look up to by them with a sort of wonder awe a a superior be he seem to know so much and he could do and say such marvellous thing and withal he wa so deep and wise tom ’ s remark and tom ’ s performance be report by the boy to their elder and these also presently begin to discus tom canty and to regard him a a most gift and extraordinary creature full grow people bring their perplexity to tom for solution and be often astonish at the wit and wisdom of his decision in fact he wa become a hero to all who know him except his own family these only saw nothing in him privately after a while tom organise a royal court he wa the prince his special comrade be guard chamberlain equerry lord and lady in wait and the royal family daily the mock prince wa receive with elaborate ceremonial

after which he would go forth in his rag and beg a few farthing eat his poor crust take his customary cuff and abuse and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw and resume his empty grandeur in his dream and still his desire to look just once upon a real prince in the flesh grow upon him day by day and week by week until at last it absorb all other desire and become the one passion of his life one january day on his usual beg tour he tramp despondently up and down the region round about mince lane and little east cheap hour after hour bare foot and cold look in at cook shop window and longing for the dreadful pork pie and other deadly invention display there for to him these be dainty fit for the angel that be judge by the smell they be for it have never be his good luck to own and eat one there wa a cold drizzle of rain the atmosphere wa murky it wa a melancholy day at night tom reach home so wet and tire and hungry that it wa not possible for his father and

awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i be scar and most shake the clothe off of me i get up and turn around in my track three time and cross my breast every time and then i tie up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witch away but i hadn ’ t no confidence you do that when you ’ ve lose a horseshoe that you ’ ve find instead of nail it up over the door but i hadn ’ t ever hear anybody say it be any way to keep off bad luck when you ’ d kill a spider i set down again a shake all over and get out my pipe for a smoke for the house be all a still a death now and so the widow wouldn ’ t know well after a long time i hear the clock away off in the town go boom boom boom twelve lick and all still again still than ever pretty soon i hear a twig snap down in the dark amongst the tree something be a stir i set still and listen directly i could just barely hear a “ me yow me yow ” down there that be good say i “ me yow me yow ” a soft a i could and then i put out the light and scramble out of the window on to the shed then i slip down to the grind and crawl in among the tree and sure enough there be tom sawyer wait for me chapter ii we go tiptoe along a path

on the hillside and go ashore we go to a clump of bush and tom make everybody swear to keep the secret and then show them a hole in the hill right in the thick part of the bush then we light the candle and crawl in on our hand and knee we go about two hundred yard and then the cave open up tom poke about amongst the passage and pretty soon duck under a wall where you wouldn ’ t a notice that there be a hole we go along a narrow place and get into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stop tom say “ now we ’ ll start this band of robber and call it tom sawyer ’ s gang

and the episode which be use to illustrate them be also historical it be not pretend that these law and custom exist in england in the sixth century no it be only pretend that inasmuch a they exist in the english and other civilization of far late time it be safe to consider that it be no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have be in practice in that day also one be quite justify in infer that whatever one of these law or custom be lack in that remote time it place be competently fill by a bad one the question a to whether there be such a thing a divine right of king be not settle in this book it be find too difficult that the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and extraordinary ability be manifest and indisputable that none but the deity could select that head unerringly be also manifest and indisputable that the deity ought to make that selection then be likewise manifest and indisputable consequently that he do make it a claim be an unavoidable deduction i mean until the author of this book encounter the pompadour and lady castlemaine and some other executive head of that kind these be find so difficult to work into the scheme that it be judge well to take the other tack in this book which must be issue this fall and then go into train and settle the question in another book it be of course a thing which ought to be settle

and then soon after depart sir kay and thank his host a i lay the book down there be a knock at the door and my stranger come in i give him a pipe and a chair and make him welcome i also comfort him with a hot scotch whisky give him another one then still another hop always for his story after a fourth persuader he drift into it himself in a quite simple and natural way the stranger s history i be an american i be bear and rear in hartford in the state of connecticut anyway just over the river in the country so i be a yankee of the yankee and practical yes and nearly barren of sentiment i suppose or poetry in other word my father be a blacksmith my uncle be a horse doctor and i be both along at first then i go over to the great arm factory and learn my real trade learn all there be to it learn to make everything gun revolver cannon boiler engine all sort of labor save machinery why i could make anything a body want anything in the world it didn t make any difference what and if there wasn t any quick new fangled way to make a thing i could invent one and do it a easy a roll off a log i become head superintendent have a couple of thousand men under me well a man like that be a man that be full of fight that go without say with a couple of thousand rough men under one one have plenty of that sort of amusement i have anyway at last i meet my match and i get my dose it be during a misunderstanding conduct with crowbar with a fellow we use to call hercules he lay me out with a crusher alongside the head that make everything crack and seem to spring every joint in my skull and make it overlap it neighbor then the world go out in darkness and i didn t feel anything more and didn t know anything at all at least for a while when i come to again i be sit under an oak tree on the grass with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself nearly not entirely for there be a fellow on a horse look down at me a fellow fresh out of a picture book he be in old time iron armor from head to heel with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail keg with slit in it and he have a shield and a sword and a prodigious spear and his horse have armor on too and a steel horn project from his forehead and gorgeous red and green silk trapping that hang down all around him like a bedquilt nearly to the grind “ fair sir will ye just ” say this fellow “ will i which ” “ will ye try a passage of arm for land or lady or for ” “ what be you give me ” i say “ get along back to your circus or i ll report you ” now what do this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yard and then come rush at me a hard a he could tear with his nail keg bend down nearly to his horse s neck and his long spear point straight ahead i saw he mean business so i be up the tree when he arrive he allow that i be his property the captive of his spear there be argument on his side and the bulk of the advantage so i judge it best to humor him we fix up an agreement whereby i be to go with him and he be not to hurt me i come down and we start away i walk by the side of his horse we march comfortably along through glade and over brook which i could not remember to have see before which puzzle me and make me wonder and yet we do not come to any circus or sign of a circus so i give up the idea of a circus and conclude he be from an asylum but we never come to an asylum so i be up a stump a you may say i ask him how far we be from hartford he say he have never hear of the place which i take to be a lie but allow it to go at that at the end of an hour we saw a far away town sleeping in a valley by a wind river and beyond it on a hill a vast gray fortress with tower and turret the first i have ever see out of a picture “ bridgeport ” say i point “ camelot ” say he my stranger have be show sign of sleepiness he catch himself nod now and smile one of those pathetic obsolete smile of his and say “ i find i can t go on but come with me i ve get it all write out and you can read it if you like ” in his chamber he say “ first i keep a journal then by and by after year i take the journal and turn it into a book how long ago that be ” he hand me his manuscript and point out the place where i should begin “ begin here i ve already tell you what go before ” he be steep in drowsiness by this time a i go out at his door i hear him murmur sleepily “ give you good den fair sir ” i sit down by my fire and examine my treasure the first part of it the great bulk of it be parchment and yellow with age i scan a leaf particularly and saw that it be a palimpsest under the old dim write of the yankee historian appear trace of a penmanship which be old and dimmer still latin word and sentence fragment from old monkish legend evidently i turn to the place indicate by my stranger and begin to read a follow the tale of the lose land chapter i camelot “ camelot camelot ” say i to myself “ i don t seem to remember hearing of it before name of the asylum likely ” it be a soft reposeful summer landscape a lovely a a dream and a lonesome a sunday the air be full of the smell of flower and the buzz of insect and the twitter of bird and there be no people no wagon there be no stir of life nothing go on the road be mainly a wind path with hoof print in it and now and then a faint trace of wheel on either side in the grass wheel that apparently have a tire a broad a one s hand presently a fair slip of a girl about ten year old with a cataract of golden hair stream down over her shoulder come along around her head she wear a hoop of flame red poppy it be a sweet an outfit a ever i saw what there be of it she walk indolently along with a mind at rest it peace reflect in her innocent face the circus man pay no attention to her didn t even seem to see her and she she be no more startle at his fantastic make up than if she be use to his like every day of her life she be go by a indifferently a she might have go by a couple of cow but when she happen to

and on every ash barrel in the new york street arouse any particular comment the employee be much more occupy with the lancer then in progress and with the joyful action of one of their number who be play blind man s buff with himself and sway from set to set in search of his partner who have give him up a hopeless and retire to the supper room for cracker and beer some of the lady wear bonnet and others wear flower in their hair and a half dozen be in gown which be obviously intend for dance and nothing else but none of them be in décolleté gown a few wear glove they have copy the fashion of their rich sister with the intuitive taste of the american girl of their class and they waltz quite a well a the lady whose dress they copy and many of them be exceedingly pretty the costume of the gentleman vary from the clothe they wear nightly when wait on the table to cutaway coat with white satin tie and the regular blue and brass button uniform of the hotel i be go to dance say van bibber if mr pierrot will present me to one of the lady paul introduce him to a lady in a white cheese cloth dress and black walk shoe with whom no one else would dance and the musician strike up the band

and say he could not imagine but that he guess from their bad manner they be professional entertainer hire for the evening the music stop abruptly and a he saw mr west leave the balcony he know that his turn have come and a she pass him he applaud her vociferously and a no one else applaud even slightly she grow very red her friend know that they form the audience which she dread and she know that they be rejoice in her embarrassment which the head of the downstairs department a mr paul describe him increase to an hysterical point by introduce her a miss ellen terry the great english actress who would now oblige with a song the man have see the name of the wonderful english actress on the bill board in front of abbey s theatre and he have be tell that miss terrell be english and

to their partner that so much time be waste in sandwich song between the waltz and the lady be engage in criticize celestine s hair which she wear in a bun they think that it might be english but it certainly be not their idea of good style celestine be conscious of the fact that her husband and lester be hang far over the balcony hold their hand to their eye a though they be opera glass and exclaim with admiration and delight and when she have finish the first verse they pretend to think that the song be over and shout bravo encore and applaud frantically and then apparently overcome with confusion at their mistake sink back entirely from sight i think miss terrell s an elegant singer van bibber s partner say to him i see her at the hotel frequently she have such a pleasant way with her quite lady like she s the only actress i ever saw that have retain her timidity she act a though she be shy don t she van bibber who have spend a month on the thames the summer before with the grahame west survey celestine with sudden interest a though he have never see her before until that moment and agree that she do look shy one might almost say frighten to death mr west rush through the second verse of the song bow breathlessly and run down the step of the stage and back to the refuge of the balcony while the audience applaud with perfunctory politeness and call clamorously to the musician to let her go and that be the song comment van bibber that get six encore and three call every night on broadway grahame west affect to be greatly chagrin at his wife s failure to charm the chambermaid and porter with her little love song and when his turn come he leave them with alacrity assure them that they would now see the difference a he would sing a song well suit to their level but the song that have charm london and capture the unprotected coast town of new york fell on heedless ear and except the evil one in the gallery no one laugh and no one listen and lester declare with tear in his eye that he would not go through such an ordeal for the receipt of an actor fund benefit van bibber s partner catch him laugh at grahame west s vain effort to amuse and say tolerantly that mr west be certainly comical but that she have a lady friend with her who could recite piece which be that comic that you d die of laugh she present her friend to van bibber and he say he hop that they be go to hear her recite a laugh must be a pleasant death but the young lady explain that she have have the misfortune to lose her only brother that summer and that she have give up everything but dance in consequence she say she do not think it look right to see a girl in mourning recite comic monologue van bibber struggle to be sympathetic and ask what her brother have die of she tell him that he die of a thursday and the conversation come to an embarrass pause van bibber s partner have another friend in a gray corduroy waistcoat and tan shoe who be of hebraic appearance he also wear several very fine ring and officiate with what be certainly religious tolerance at the m e bethel church she say he be an elegant or gin ist put the emphasis on the second syllable which make van bibber think that she be speak of some religious body to which he belong but the organist make his profession clear by explain that the committee have just invite him to oblige the company with a solo on the piano but that he have be hit the champagne so hard that he doubt if he could tell the key from the pedal and he add that if they d excuse him he would go to sleep which he immediately do with his head on the shoulder of the lady recitationist who tactfully try not to notice that he be there they be all waltz again and a van bibber guide his partner for a second time around the room he notice a particularly handsome girl in a walk dress who be do some sort of a fancy step with a solemn grave face young man in the hotel livery they seem by their manner to know each other very well and they have apparently practise the step that they be do often before the girl be much tall than the man and be superior to him in every way her movement be free and less conscious and she carry her head and shoulder a though she have never bend them above a broom her complexion be soft and her hair of the fine deep auburn among all the girl upon the floor she be the most remarkable even if her dance have not immediately distinguish her the step which she and her partner be exhibit be one that probably have be teach her by a professor of dance at some east side academy at the rate of fifty cent per hour and which she no doubt believe be the late step dance in the gild hall of the few hundred in this waltz the two dancer hold each other s hand and the man swing his

fight or the rumor of fight the procedure of the general invariably be the same he would order himself to instantly depart for the front and on arrive there would offer to organize a foreign legion the command of this organization always be give to him but the foreign legion be merely the enter wedge he would soon show that he be fit for a well command than a band of undisciplined volunteer and would receive a commission in the regular army in almost every command in which he serve that be the manner in which promotion come sometimes he saw but little fight sometimes he should have die several death each of a nature more unpleasant than the others for in war the obvious danger of a bullet be but a three hundred to one shoot while in the pack against the combatant the joker be innumerable and in the career of the general the unforeseen adventure be the most interest a man who in eighteen campaign have play his part would seem to have earn exemption from any other risk but often it be outside the battle field that maciver encounter the greatest danger he fight several duel in two of which he kill his adversary several attempt be make to assassinate him and while on his way to mexico he be capture by hostile indian on return from an expedition in cuba he be cast adrift in an open boat and for day be without food long before i meet general maciver i have read his book and have hear of him from many men who have meet him in many different land while engage in a many different undertake several of the old war correspondent know him intimately bennett burleigh of the telegraph be his friend and e f knight of the time be one of those who volunteer for a filibuster expedition which maciver organize against new guinea the late colonel ochiltree of texas tell me tale of maciver ’ s bravery when a young men they be fellow officer in the southern army and stephen bonsal have meet him when maciver be unite state consul at denia in spain when maciver arrive at this post the ex consul refuse to vacate the consulate and maciver wish to settle the difficulty with duel pistol a denia be a small place the inhabitant fear for their safety and bonsal who be our charge d ’ affaire then be send from madrid to adjust matter without bloodshed he get rid of the ex consul and late maciver so endear himself to the denians that they beg the state department to retain him in that place for the remainder of his life before general maciver be appoint to a high position at the st louis fair i saw much of him in new york his room be in a side street in an old fashion board house and overlook his neighbor ’ s back yard and a typical new york city sumac tree but when the general talk one forget he be within a block of the elevate and roam over all the world on his bed he would spread out wonderful parchment with strange heathenish inscription with great seal with fade ribbon these be sign by sultan secretary of war emperor filibuster they be military commission title of nobility brevet for decoration instruction and command from superior officer translate the phrase run “ impose special confidence in ” “ we appoint ” or “ create ” or “ declare ” or “ in recognition of service render to our person ” or “ country ” or “ cause ” or “ for bravery on the field of battle we bestow the cross ” a must a soldier the general travel “ light ” and all his worldly possession be crowd ready for mobilization into a small compass he have his sword his field blanket his trunk and the tin despatch box that hold his paper from these like a conjurer he would draw souvenir of all the world from the embrace of fade letter he would unfold old photograph daguerrotypes and miniature of fair woman and adventurous men woman who now be queen in exile men who lift on wave of absinthe still across a cafe table tell how they will win back a crown once in a write document the general do me the honor to appoint me his literary executor but a he be young and a healthy a myself it never may be my lot to perform such an unwelcome duty and to day all one can write of him be what the world can read in “ under fourteen flag ” and some of the “ foot note to history ” which i have copy from his scrap book this scrap book be a wonderful volume but owe to “ political ” and other reason for the present of the many clipping from newspaper it contain there be only a few i be at liberty to print and from them it be difficult to make a choice to sketch in a few thousand word a career that have develop under eighteen flag be in it very wealth embarrass here be one story a tell by the scrap book of an expedition that fail that it fail be due to a british cabinet minister for have lord derby possess the imagination of the soldier of fortune his majesty ’ s dominion might now be the rich by many thousand of square mile and many thousand of black subject on october the follow appear in the london standard “ the new guinea exploration and colonization company be already charter and the first expedition expect to leave before christmas ” “ the prospectus state settler intend to join the first party must contribute one hundred pound toward the company this subscription will include all expense for passage money six month ’ provision will be provide together with tent and arm for protection each subscriber of one hundred pound be to obtain a certificate entitle him to one thousand acre ” the view of the colonization scheme take by the time of london of the same date be less complaisant “ the late commercial sensation be a propose company for the seizure of new guinea certain adventurous gentleman be look out for one hundred others who have money and a taste for buccaneering when the company have be complete it share holder be to place themselves under military regulation sail in a body for new guinea and without ask anybody ’ s leave seize upon the island and at once in some unspecified way proceed to realize large profit if the idea do not suggest comparison with the large design of sir francis drake it be at least not unworthy of captain kidd ” when we remember the manner in which some of the colony of great britain be acquire the time seem almost squeamish in a melbourne paper june be the follow paragraph “ toward the latter part of the government of queensland plant the flag of great britain on the shore of new guinea when the news reach england it create a sensation the earl of derby secretary for the colony refuse however to sanction the annexation of new guinea and in so do act contrary to the sincere wish of every right think anglo saxon under the southern cross “ while the subsequent correspondence between the home and queensland government be go on brigadier general h r maciver originate and organize the new guinea exploration and colonization company in london with a view to establish settlement on the island the company preside over by general beresford of the british army and have an eminently representative and influential board of director have a capital of two hundred and fifty thousand pound and place the supreme command of the expedition in the hand of general maciver notwithstanding the character of the gentleman compose the board of director and the truly peaceful nature of the expedition his lordship inform general maciver that in the event of the latter ’ s attempt to land on new guinea instruction would be send to the officer in command of her majesty ’ s fleet in the western pacific to fire upon the company ’ s vessel this mean that the expedition would be deal with a a filibuster one ” in judy september appear “ we all recollect the treatment receive by brigadier general maci in the action he take with respect to the annexation of new guinea the general who be a sort of pizarro with a dash of d ’ artagnan be treat in a most scurvy manner by lord derby have maciver not be thwart in his enterprise the whole of new guinea would now have be under the british flag and we should not be cheek by jowl with the german a we be in too many place ” society september say “ the new guinea expedition prove abortive owe to the blunder shortsightedness of the then government for which lord derby be chiefly responsible but what little foothold we possess in new guinea be certainly due to general maciver ’ s gallant effort ” copy of statement make by j rintoul mitchell june “ about the latter end of the year when i be editor in chief of the englishman in calcutta i be tell by captain de deaux assistant secretary in the foreign office of the indian government that he have receive a telegram from lord derby to the effect that if general maciver venture to land upon the coast of new guinea it would become the duty of lord ripon viceroy to use the naval force at his command for the purpose of deport general maci sir aucland calvin can certify to this a it be discuss in the viceregal council ” just after our civil war maciver be interest in another expedition which also fail it member call themselves the knight of arabia and their object be to colonize an island much near to our shore than new guinea maciver say that his oath prevent would never tell me which island this be but the reader can choose from among cuba haiti and the hawaiian group to have take cuba the “ colonizer ” would have have to fight not only spain but the cuban themselves on whose side they be soon fight in the ten year ’ war so cuba may be eliminate and a the expedition be to sail from the atlantic side and not from san francisco the island would appear to be the black republic from the record of the time it would seem that the great number of the knight of arabia be veteran of the confederate army and there be no question but that they intend to subjugate the black of haiti and form a republic for white men in which slavery would be recognize a one of the leader of this filibuster expedition maciver be arrest by general phil sheridan and for a short time cast into jail this chafe the general ’ s spirit but he argue philosophically that imprisonment for filibuster while irksome bring with it no reproach and indeed sometimes the only difference between a filibuster and a government lie in the fact that the government fight the gun boat of only the enemy while a filibuster must dodge the boat of the enemy and those of his own countryman when the unite state go to war with spain there be many men in jail a filibuster for do that which at the time the country secretly approve and late imitate and because they attempt exactly the same thing for which dr jameson be imprison in holloway jail two hundred thousand of his countryman be now wear medal the by law of the knight of arabia leave but little doubt a to it object by law no ii read “ we a knight of arabia pledge ourselves to aid comfort and protect all knight of arabia especially those who be wound in obtain our grand object “ iii great care must be take that no unbeliever or outsider shall gain any insight into the mystery or secret of the order “ iv the candidate will have to pay one hundred dollar cash to the captain of the company and the candidate will receive from the secretary a knight of arabia bond for one hundred dollar in gold with ten per cent interest payable ninety day after the recognition of the republic of by the unite state or any government “ v all knight of arabia will be entitle to one hundred acre of land location of say land to be draw for by lottery the product be coffee sugar tobacco and cotton ” a local correspondent of the new york herald write of the arrest of maciver a follow “ when maciver will be try be at present unknown a his case have assume a complicate aspect he claim british protection a a subject of her british majesty and the english consul have forward a statement of his case to sir frederick bruce at washington accompany by a copy of the by law general sheridan also have forward a statement to the secretary of war accompany not only by the by law but very important document include letter from jefferson davis benjamin the secretary of state of the confederate state and other personage prominent in the rebellion show that maciver enjoy the high confidence of the confederacy ” a to the last statement an open letter i find in his scrap book be an excellent proof it be a follow “ to officer and member of all camp of unite confederate veteran it afford me the greatest pleasure to say that the bearer of this letter general henry ronald maciver be an officer of great gallantry in the confederate army serve on the staff at various time of general stonewall jackson j e b stuart and e kirby smith and that his official record be one of which any man may be proud “ respectfully marcus j wright “ agent for the collection of confederate record “ war record office war department washington july ” at the close of the war duel between officer of the two army be not infrequent in the scrap book there be the account of one of these affair send from vicksburg to a northern paper by a correspondent who be an eye witness of the event it tell how major maciver

december of by a force of the guardia civile the corp d elite of the spanish army and defend himself when they try to capture him wound three of them with his machete he be try by a military court for bear arm against the government and sentence to be shoot by a fusillade some morning before sunrise previous to execution he be confine in the military prison of santa clara with thirty other insurgent all of whom be sentence to be shoot one after the other on morning follow the execution of rodriguez his execution take place the morning of the th of january at a place a half mile distant from the city on the great plain that stretch from the fort out to the hill beyond which rodriguez have live for nineteen year at the time of his death he be twenty year old i witness his execution and what follow be an account of the way he go to his death the young man s friend could not be present for it be impossible for them to show themselves in that crowd and that place with wisdom or without distress and i like to think that although rodriguez could not know it there be one person present when he die who felt keenly for him and who be a sympathetic though unwilling spectator there have be a full moon the night precede the execution and when the squad of soldier march from town it be still shin brightly through the mist it light a plain two mile in extent break by ridge and gully and cover with thick high grass and with bunch of cactus and palmetto in the hollow of the ridge the mist lay like broad lake of water and on one side of the plain stand the wall of the old town on the other rise hill cover with royal palm that show white in the moonlight like hundred of marble column a line of tiny camp fire that the sentry have build during the night stretch between the fort at regular interval and burn clearly but a the light grow strong and the moonlight fade these be stamp out and when the soldier come in force the moon be a white ball in the sky without radiance the fire have sink to ash and the sun have not yet rise so even when the men be form into three side of a hollow square they be scarcely able to distinguish one another in the uncertain light of the morning there be about three hundred soldier in the formation they belong to the volunteer and they deploy upon the plain with their band in front play a jaunty quickstep while their officer gallop from one side to the other through the grass seek a suitable place for the execution outside the line the band still play merrily a few men and boy who have be drag out of their bed by the music move about the ridge behind the soldier half clothe unshaven sleepy eye yawn stretch themselves nervously and shiver in the cool damp air of the morning either owe to discipline or on account of the nature of their errand or because the men be still but half awake there be no talk in the rank and the soldier stand motionless lean on their rifle with their back turn to the town look out across the plain to the hill the men in the crowd behind them be also grimly silent they know that whatever they might say would be twist into a word of sympathy for the condemn man or a protest against the government so no one speak even the officer give their order in gruff whisper and the men in the crowd do not mix together but look suspiciously at one another and keep apart a the light increase a mass of people come hurry from the town with two black figure lead them and the soldier draw up at attention and part of the double line fell back and leave an opening in the square with u a condemn man walk only the short distance from his cell to the scaffold or the electric chair shield from sight by the prison wall and it often occur even then that the short journey be too much for his strength and courage but the spaniard on this morning make the prisoner walk for over a half mile across the break surface of the field i expect to find the man no matter what his strength at other time might be stumble and falter on this cruel journey but a he come near i saw that he lead all the others that the priest on either side of him be take two step to his one and that they be trip on their gown and stumble over the hollow in their effort to keep pace with him a he walk erect and soldierly at a quick step in advance of them he have a handsome gentle face of the peasant type a light point beard great wistful eye and a mass of curly black hair he be shockingly young for such a sacrifice and look more like a neapolitan than a cuban you could imagine him sit on the quay at naples or genoa loll in the sun and show his white teeth when he laugh around his neck hang outside his linen blouse he wear a new scapular it seem a petty thing to have be please with at such a time but i confess to have felt a thrill of satisfaction when i saw a the cuban pass me that he hold a cigarette between his lip not arrogantly nor with bravado but with the nonchalance of a man who meet his punishment fearlessly and who will let his enemy see that they can kill but can not frighten him it be very quickly finish with rough and but for one frightful blunder with merciful swiftness the crowd fell back when it come to the square and the condemn man the priest and the fire squad of six young volunteer pass in and the line close behind them the officer who have hold the cord that bind the cuban s arm behind him and pass across his breast let it fall on the grass and draw his sword and rodriguez drop his cigarette from his lip and bend and kiss the cross which the priest hold up before him the elder of the priest move to one side and pray rapidly in a loud whisper while the other a young man walk behind the fire squad and cover his face with his hand they have both spend the last twelve hour with rodriguez in the chapel of the prison the cuban walk to where the officer direct him to stand and turn his back on the square face the hill and the road across them which lead to his father s farm a the officer give the first command he straighten himself a far a the cord would allow and hold up his head and fix his eye immovably on the morning light which have just begin to show above the hill he make a picture of such pathetic helplessness but of such courage and dignity that he remind me on the instant of that statue of nathan hale which stand in the city hall park above the roar of broadway the cuban s arm be bind a be those of the statue and he stand firmly with his weight rest on his heel like a soldier on parade and with his face hold up fearlessly a be that of the statue but there be this difference that rodriguez while probably a will to give six life for his country a be the american rebel be only a peasant do not think to say so and he will not in consequence live in bronze during the life of many men but will be remember only a one of thirty cuban one of whom be shoot at santa clara on each succeed day at sunrise the officer have give the order the men have raise their piece and the condemn man have hear the click of the trigger a they be pull back and he have not move and then happen one of the most cruelly refine though unintentional act of torture that one can very well imagine a the officer slowly raise his sword preparatory to give the signal one of the mount officer ride up to him and point out silently that a i have already observe with some satisfaction the fire squad be so place that when they fire they would shoot several of the soldier station on the extreme end of the square their captain motion his men to lower their piece and then walk across the grass and lay his hand on the shoulder of the wait prisoner it be not pleasant to think what that shock must have be the man have steel himself to receive a volley of bullet he believe that in the next instant he would be in another world he have hear the command give have hear the click of the mauser a the lock catch and then at that supreme moment a human hand have be lay upon his shoulder and a voice speak in his ear you would expect that any man snatch back to life in such a fashion would start and tremble at the reprieve or would break down altogether but this boy turn his head steadily and follow with his eye the direction of the officer s sword then nod gravely and with his shoulder square take up the new position straighten his back and once more hold himself erect a an exhibition of self control this should surely rank above feat of heroism perform in battle where there be thousand of comrade to give inspiration this man be alone in sight of the hill he know with only enemy about him with no source to draw on for strength but that which lay within himself picture the death of rodriguez the officer of the fire squad mortify by his blunder hastily whip up his sword the men once more level their rifle the sword rise drop and the men fire at the report the cuban s head snap back almost between his shoulder but his body fell slowly a though some one have push him gently forward from behind and he have stumble he sink on his side in the wet grass without a struggle or sound and do not move again it be difficult to believe that he mean to lie there that it could be end so without a word that the man in the linen suit would not rise to his foot and continue to walk on over the hill a he apparently have start to do to his home that there be not a mistake somewhere or that at least some one would be sorry or say something or run to pick him up but fortunately he do not need help and the priest return the young one with the tear run down his face and don their vestment and read a brief requiem for his soul while the squad stand uncover and the men in hollow square shake their accoutrement into place and shift their piece and get ready for the order to march and the band begin again with the same quickstep which the fusillade have interrupt the figure still lay on the grass untouched and no one seem to remember that it have walk there of itself or notice that the cigarette still burn a tiny ring of live fire at the place where the figure have first stand the figure be a thing of the past and the squad shake itself like a great snake and then break into little piece and start off jauntily stumble in the high grass and strive to keep step to the music the officer lead it past the figure in the linen suit and so close to it that the file closer have to part with the column to avoid tread on it each soldier a he pass turn and look down on it some crane their neck curiously others give a careless glance and some without any interest at all a they would have look at a house by the roadside or a hole in the road one young soldier catch his foot in a trail vine just opposite to it and fell he grow very red when his comrade giggle at him for his awkwardness the crowd of sleepy spectator fell in on either side of the band they too have forget it and the priest put their vestment back in the bag and wrap their heavy cloak about them and hurry off after the others every one seem to have forget it except two men who come slowly towards it from the town drive a bullock cart that bore an unplaned coffin each with a cigarette between his lip and with his throat wrap in a shawl to keep out the morning mist at that moment the sun which have show some promise of it come in the glow above the hill shoot up suddenly from behind them in all the splendor of the tropic a fierce red disk of heat and fill the air with warmth and light the bayonet of the retreat column flash in it and at the sight a rooster in a farm yard near by crow vigorously and a dozen bugle answer the challenge with the brisk cheery note of the reveille and from all part of the city the church bell jangle out the call for early mass and the little world of santa clara seem to stretch itself and to wake to welcome the day just begin but a i fell in at the rear of the procession and look back the figure of the young cuban who be no long a part of the world of santa clara be asleep in the wet grass with his motionless arm still tightly bind behind him with the scapular twist awry across his face and the blood from his breast sink into the soil he have try to free the greek turkish war the battle of velestinos the turk have make three attack on velestinos on three different day and each time have be repulse a week

the deck be crowd chiefly with those english whose face be familiar at the savoy and the ritz and who within an hour have settle down to seventeen day of uninterrupted bridge with before them the prospect on land of the luxury of the mount nelson and the hospitality of government house when the other day we again leave southampton that former departure come back in strange contrast it emphasize that this time we be not accompany civilization on one of her fly leap instead now we be go down to the sea in ship with the vortrekkers of civilization those who be make the way straight who in a few week will be leave u to lose themselves in great forest who clear the path of noisome jungle where the sun seldom penetrate who sit in sun bake factory a they call their trade house measure life by steamer day who preach the gospel to the cannibal of the congo whose voice be the voice of those call in the wilderness a our tender come alongside the bruxellesville at southampton we saw at the winch kroo boy of the ivory coast lean over the rail the soeurs blanch of the congo rob although the cold be bitter and the deck black with soot stain snow all in white missionary with long beard a bishop in a purple biretta and innumerable belgian officer shiver in their cloak and wear the blue ribbon and silver star that tell of three year of service along the equator this time our fellow passenger be no pleasure seeker no cook s tourist sailing south to avoid a rigorous winter they have squeeze the last minute out of their leave and they be go back to the station to the factory to the mission to the barrack they call themselves coaster and they inhabit a world all to themselves in square mile it be a very big world but it be one of those place civilization have skip nearly every one of our passenger from antwerp or southampton know that if he keep his contract and do not die it will be three year before he again see his home so our departure be not enliven and in the smoking room the exile prepare u for lonely port of call for sicken heat for swarm multitude of black in consequence when we pass finisterre spain which from new york seem almost a foreign country be a near neighbor a dear friend and the island of teneriffe be an anticlimax it be a though by a trick of the compass we have be sailing southwest and be enter the friendly harbor of ponce or havana santa cruz the port town of teneriffe like la guayra rise at the base of great hill it be a smile bright color red roof typical spanish town the hill about it mount in innumerable terrace plant with fruit and vegetable and from many of these house on the hill should the owner step hurriedly out of his front door he would land upon the roof of his near neighbor back of this first chain of hill be broad farm land and plateau from which barcelona and london be feed with the early and the most tender of potato that appear in england at the same time bermuda potato be be print in big letter on the bill of fare along broadway santa cruz itself supply pass steamer with coal and passenger with lace work and post card and to the english in search of sunshine with a rival to madeira it should be a successful rival for it be a charm place and on the day we be there the thermometer be at ° and every one be complain of the cruel severity of the winter in santa cruz one who know spanish america have but to shut his eye and imagine himself back in santiago de cuba or caracas there be the same charm plaza the yellow church and tower cathedral the long iron bar window glimpse through marble pave hall of cool patio the same open shop one find in obispo and o reilly street the idle officer with smart uniform and swing sword in front of cafés kill time and digestion with sweet drink and over the garden wall great bunch of purple and scarlet flower and shelter palm the show place in santa cruz be the church in which be store the relic of the sea fight in which a a young man nelson lose his arm and england also lose two battleflags a she be not often careless in that respect it be a surprise to find in this tiny tuck away little island what you will not see in any of the show place of the world they tell in santa cruz that one night an english middy single hand recapture the capture flag and carry them triumphantly to his battleship he expect at the least a k c b and when the flag with a squad of british marine a a guard of honor be solemnly replace in the church and the middy himself be send upon a tour of apology to the bishop the governor the commandant of the fortress the alcalde the collector of custom and the captain of the port he declare that monarchy be ungrateful the other object of interest in teneriffe be camel which in the interior of the island be common beast of burden and which appear suddenly around a turn would frighten any automobile and the fact that in teneriffe the fashion in woman s hat never change they be very funny flat straw hat like child s sailor hat they need only u s s iowa on the band to be quite familiar their secret be that they be build to support basket and bucket of water and that conceal in each be a heavy pad illustration mr davis in a borrow hammock the local mean of transport on the west coast after teneriffe the destination of every one on board be a irrevocably fix a though the ship be a government transport we be all go to the west coast or to the congo should you wish to continue on to cape town along the south coast a they call the vast territory from lagos to cape town although there be an irregular a very irregular service to the cape you could a quickly reach it by go on to the congo return all the way to southampton and again start on the direct line south it be a though a line of steamer run down our coast to florida would not continue on along the south coast to new orleans and galveston and a though no line of steamer come from new orleans and galveston to meet the steamer of the east coast in consequence the west coast of africa cut off by lack of communication from the south divorce from the north by the desert of sahara lie in the steam heat of the equator to day a it do a thousand year ago in inaccessible inhospitable isolation two element have help to preserve this isolation the fever that rise from it swamp and lagoon and the surf that thunder upon the shore in consider the stunt development of the west coast these two element must be keep in mind the sickness that strike at sunset and by sunrise leave the victim dead and the monster wave that rush boom like cannon at the beach churn the sandy bottom beneath and hurl aside the great canoe a a man toss a cigarette the clerk who sign the three year contract to work on the west coast enlist against a great chance of death than the soldier who enlist to fight only bullet and every box puncheon or barrel that the trader send in a canoe through the surf be insure against it never reach a the case may be the shore or the ship s side the surf and the fever be the minotaur of the west coast and in the year there be not a day pass that they do not claim and receive their tribute in merchandise and human life say an old coaster to me point at the harbor of grand bassam i ve see just a much cargo lose overboard in that surf a i ve see ship to europe one constantly wonder how the coaster find it good enough how since when the portuguese begin trade it have be possible to find men will to fill the place of those who die but in spite of the early massacre by the native in spite of attack by wild beast in spite of pirate raid of desolate plague and epidemic of war with other white men of damp heat and sudden sickness there be men who patiently rebuild the fort and factory fight the surf with great breakwater clear breathe space in the jungle and with the aid of quinine for themselves and bad gin for the native have hold their own except for the trade good it never would be hold it be a country where the pay be cruelly inadequate where but few horse sheep or cattle can exist where the native be unbelievably lazy and insolent and where while there be no society of congenial spirit there be a superabundance of animal and insect pest still so great be gold ivory and rubber and so many be the men who will take big chance for little pay that every foot of the west coast be preëmpted a the ship roll along for hour from the rail you see mile and mile of steam yellow sand and misty swamp where a yet no white man have set his foot but in the real estate office of europe some power claim the right to protect that swamp some treaty be file a a title deed a the power finally arrange it the map of the west coast be like a mosaic like the edge of a badly construct patchwork quilt in trade along the west coast a man can find use for five european language and he can use a new one at each port of call to the north the west coast begin with cape verde which be spanish it be follow by senegal which be french but into senegal be tuck a thin red line of british territory call gambia senegal close in again around gambia and be at once block to the south by the three corner patch which belong to portugal this be follow by french guinea down to another british red spot sierra leone which meet liberia the republic of negro emigrant from the unite state south of liberia be the french ivory coast then the english gold coast togo which be german dahomey which be french lagos and southern nigeria which again be english fernando po which be spanish and the german cameroon the coast line of these protectorate and colony give no idea of the extent of their hinterland which spread back into the sahara the niger basin and the soudan sierra leone one of the small of them be a large a maine liberia where the emigrant still keep up the tradition of the unite state by talk like end men be a large a the state of new york two other colony senegal and nigeria together be square mile large than the combine square mile of all of our atlantic state from maine to florida and include both to partition finally among the power this strip of death and disease of uncountable wealth of unnamed horror

be a the politician say in the hand of my friend entirely too much in the hand of my friend she repeat a she turn away this be the twelfth time during that same winter that she and mr king have be place next to one another at dinner and it have pass beyond the point when she could say that it do not matter what people think a long a she and he understand it have now reach that stage when she be not quite sure that she understand either him or herself they have know each other for a very long time too long she sometimes think for them ever to grow to know each other any well but there be always the chance that he have another side one that have not disclose itself and which she could not discover in the strict social environment in which they both live and she be the sure of this because she have once see him when he do not know that she be near and he have be so different that it have puzzle her and make her wonder if she know the real reggie king at all it be at a dance at a studio and some french pantomimist give a little play when it be over king sit in the corner talk to one of the frenchwoman and while he wait on her he be laugh at her and at her effort to speak english he be tell her how to say certain phrase and not tell her correctly and she suspect this and be accuse him of it and they be rhapsodize and exclaim over certain delightful place and dish of which they both know in paris with the enthusiasm of two child miss langham saw him off his guard for the first time and instead of a somewhat bore and clever man of the world he appear a sincere and interest a a boy when he join her late the same evening he be a entertain a usual and a polite and attentive a he have be to the frenchwoman but he be not greatly interest and his laugh be modulate and not spontaneous she have wonder that night and frequently since then if in the event of his ask her to marry him which be possible and of her accept him which be also possible whether she would find him in the close knowledge of marry life a keen and lighthearted with her a he have be with the french dancer if he would but treat her more like a comrade and equal and less like a prime minister confer with his queen she want something more intimate than the deference that he show her and she do not like his take it a an accept fact that she be a worldly wise a himself even though it be true she be a woman and want to be love in spite of the fact that she have be love by many men at least it be so suppose and have reject them each have offer her position or have want her because she be fit to match his own great state or because he be ambitious or because she be rich the man who could love her a she once believe men could love and who could give her something else besides approval of her beauty and her mind have not disclose himself she have begin to think that he never would that he do not exist that he be an imagination of the playhouse and the novel the men whom she know be careful to show her that they appreciate how distinguish be her position and how inaccessible she be to them they seem to think that by so humble themselves and by emphasize her position they please her best when it be what she want them to forget each of them would draw away backward bow and protest that he be unworthy to raise his eye to such a prize but that if she would only stoop to him how happy his life would be sometimes they mean it sincerely sometimes they be gentlemanly adventurer of title from whom it be a business proposition and in either case she turn restlessly away and ask herself how long it would be before the man would come who would pick her up on his saddle and gallop off with her with his arm around her waist and his horse s hoof clatter beneath them and echo the tumult in their heart she have know too many great people in the world to feel impress with her own position at home in america but she sometimes compare herself to the queen in in a balcony and repeat to herself with mock seriousness and you the marble statue all the time they praise and point at a prefer to life yet leave for the first breathe woman s cheek first dancer s gypsy s or street balladine s and if it be true she ask herself that the man she have imagine be only an ideal and an illusion be not king the best of the others the unideal and ever present others every one else seem to think so the society they know put them constantly together and approve her people approve her own mind approve and a her heart be not apparently ever to be consider who could say that it do not approve a well he be certainly a very charm fellow a manly clever companion and one who bore about him the evidence of distinction and thorough breeding a far a family go the king be a old a a young country could expect and reggie king be moreover in spite of his wealth a man of action and ability his yacht journey from continent to continent and not merely up the sound to newport and he be a well know and welcome to the consul along the coast of africa and south america a he be at cow or nice his book of voyage be recognize by geographical society and other serious body who have give him permission to put long disarrangement of the alphabet after his name she like him because she have grow to be at home with him because it be good to know that there be some one who would not misunderstand her and who should she so indulge herself would not take advantage of any appeal she might make to his sympathy who would always be sure to do the tactful thing and the courteous thing and who while he might never do a great thing could not do an unkind one miss langham have enter the porter draw room after the great number of the guest have arrive and she turn from her hostess to listen to an old gentleman with a passion for golf a passion in which he have for a long time be endeavor to interest her she answer him and his enthusiasm in kind and with a much apparent interest a she would have show in a matter of state it be her principle to be all thing to all men whether they be great artist great diplomat or great bore if a man have be plead with her to leave the conservatory and run away with him and another have come up innocently and announce that it be his dance she would have say oh be it with a much apparent delight a though his come have be the one bright hope in her life she be grow enthusiastic over the delight of golf and unconsciously make a very beautiful picture of herself in her interest and force vivacity when she become conscious for the first time of a strange young man who be stand alone before the fireplace look at her and frankly listen to all the nonsense she be talk she guess that he have be listen for some time and she also saw before he turn his eye quickly away that he be distinctly amuse miss langham stop gesticulate and lower her voice but continue to keep her eye on the face of the stranger whose own eye be wander around the room to give her so she guess the idea that he have not be listen but that she have catch him at it in the moment he have first look at her he be a tall broad shoulder youth with a handsome face tan and dye either by the sun or by exposure to the wind to a deep ruddy brown which contrast strangely with his yellow hair and mustache and with the pallor of the other face about him he be a stranger apparently to every one present and his bear suggest in consequence that ease of manner which come to a person who be not only sure of himself but who have no knowledge of the claim and pretension to social distinction of those about him his most attractive feature be his eye which seem to observe all that be go on not only what be on the surface but beneath the surface and that not rudely or covertly but with the frank quick look of the train observer miss langham find it an interest face to watch and she do not look away from it she be acquaint with every one else in the room and hence she know this must be the cowboy of whom mr porter have speak and she wonder how any one who have live the rough life of the west could still retain the look when in formal clothe of one who be in the habit of do informal thing in them mr porter present her cowboy simply a mr clay of whom i speak to you with a significant raise of the eyebrow and the cowboy make way for king who take miss langham in he look frankly please however when he find himself next to her again but do not take advantage of it throughout the first part of the dinner during which time he talk to the young marry woman on his right and miss langham and king continue where they have leave off at their last meet they know each other well enough to joke of the way in which they be throw into each other s society and a she say they try to make the best of it but while she speak miss langham be continually conscious of the presence of her neighbor who pique her interest and her curiosity in different way he seem to be at his ease and yet from the manner in which he glance up and down the table and listen to snatch of talk on either side of him he have the appearance of one to whom it be all new and who be see it for the first time there be a jolly group at one end of the long table and they wish to emphasize the fact by laugh a little more hysterically at their remark than the humor of those witticism seem to justify a daughter in law of mr porter be their leader in this and at one point she stop in the middle of a story and wave her hand at the double row of face turn in her direction which have be attract by the loudness of her voice cry gayly don t listen this be for private circulation it be not a jeune fille story the debutante at the table continue talk again in steady even tone a though they have not hear the remark or the first of the story and the men next to them appear equally unconscious but the cowboy miss langham note out of the corner of her eye after a look of polite surprise beam with amusement and continue to stare up and down the table a though he have discover a new trait in a peculiar and interest animal for some reason she could not tell why she felt annoy with herself and with her friend and resent the attitude which the new comer assume toward them mr porter tell me that you know her son george she say he do not answer her at once but bow his head in assent with a look of interrogation a though so it seem to her he have expect her when she do speak to say something less conventional yes he reply after a pause he join u at ayutla it be the terminus of the jalisco and mexican railroad then he come out over the road and go in from there with an outfit after mountain lion i believe he have very good sport that be a very wonderful road i be tell say king bend forward and introduce himself into the conversation with a nod of the head toward clay quite a remarkable feat of engineering it will open up the country i believe assent the other indifferently i know something of it continue king because i meet the men who be put it through at pariqua when we touch there in the yacht they ship most of their plant to that port and we saw a good deal of them they be a very jolly lot and they give me a most interest account of their work and it difficulty clay be look at the other closely a though he be try to find something back of what he be say but a his glance seem only to embarrass king he smile freely again in assent and give him his full attention there be no men to day miss langham king exclaim suddenly turn toward her to my mind who lead a picturesque life a do civil engineer and there be no men whose work be a little appreciate really say miss langham encouragingly now those men i meet continue king settle himself with his side to the table be all young fellow of thirty or thereabouts but they be lead the life of pioneer and martyr at least that s what i d call it they be march through an almost unknown part of mexico fight nature at every step and carry civilization with them they be do well work than soldier because soldier destroy thing and these chap be create and make the way straight they have no banner either nor brass band they fight mountain and river and they be attack on every side by fever and the lack of food and severe exposure they have to sit down around a camp fire at night and calculate whether they be to tunnel a mountain or turn the bed of a river or bridge it and they know all the time that whatever they decide to do out there in the wilderness mean thousand of dollar to the stockholder somewhere up in god s country who would some day hold them to account for them they drag their chain through mile and mile of jungle and over flat alkali bed and cactus and they rear bridge across roar canon we know nothing about them and we care less when their work be do we ride over the road in an observation car and look down thousand and thousand of foot into the depth they have bridge and we never give them a think they be the brave soldier of the present day and they be the least recognize i have forget their name and you never hear them but it seem to me the civil engineer for all that be the chief civilizer of our century miss langham be

chapter i so it be in him then an inherit fight instinct a drive intensity to kill he be the last of the duanes that old fight stock of texas but not the memory of his dead father nor the plead of his soft voice mother nor the warn of this uncle who stand before him now have bring to buck duane so much realization of the dark passionate strain in his blood it be the recurrence a hundred fold increase in power of a strange emotion that for the last three year have arise in him “ yes cal bain s in town full of bad whisky an huntin for you ” repeat the elder man gravely “ it s the second time ” mutter duane a if to himself “ son you can t avoid a meetin leave town till cal sober up he ain t get it in for you when he s not drinkin ” “ but what s he want me for ” demand duane “ to

afraid you re a chip off the old block can t you hold in keep your temper run away from trouble because it ll only result in you gettin the worst of it in the end your father be kill in a street fight an it be tell of him that he shoot twice after a bullet have pass through his heart think of the terrible nature of a man to be able to do that if you have any such blood in you never give it a chance ” “ what you say be all very well uncle ” return duane “ but the only way out for me be to run and i win t do it cal bain and his outfit have already make me look like a coward he say i m afraid to

alive and here ” say duane “ what do you think what could you expect of a man who never wear a glove on his right hand for twenty year ” “ well he d hardly have say much dad never talk but he would have do a lot and i guess i ll go down town and let cal bain find me ” then follow a long silence during which duane sit with downcast eye and the uncle appear lose in sad think of the future presently he turn to duane with an expression that denote resignation and yet a spirit which show wherein they be of the same blood “ you ve get a fast horse the fast i know of in this country after you meet bain hurry back home i ll have a saddle bag pack for you and the horse ready ” with that he turn on his heel and go into the house leave duane to revolve in his mind his singular speech buck wonder presently if he share his uncle s opinion of the result of a meet between himself and bain his thought be vague but on the instant of final decision when he have settle with himself that he would meet bain such a storm of passion assail him that he felt a if he be be shake with ague yet it be all internal inside his breast for his hand be like a rock and for all he could see not a muscle about him quiver he have no fear of bain or of any other man but a vague fear of himself of this strange force in him make him ponder and shake his head it be a if he have not all to say in this matter there appear to have be in him a reluctance to let himself go and some voice some spirit from a distance something he be not accountable for have compel him that hour of duane s life be like year of actual live and in it he become a thoughtful man he go into the house and buckle on his belt and gun the gun be a colt six shoot and heavy with an ivory handle he have pack it on and off for five year before that it have be use by his father there be a number of notch file in the bulge of the ivory handle this gun be the one his father have fire twice after be shoot through the heart and

51,zaneGrey_toLastMan,zane_grey,98457,﻿ to the last man by zane grey foreword it be inevitable that in my effort to write romantic history of the great west i should at length come to the story of a feud for long i have steer clear of this rock but at last i have reach it and must go over it drive by my desire to chronicle the stir event of pioneer day even to day it be not possible to travel into the remote corner of the west without see the life of people still affect by a fight past how can the truth be tell about the pioneer of the west if the struggle the fight the blood be leave out it can not be do how can a novel be stir and thrill a be those time unless it be full of sensation my long labor have be devote to make story resemble the time they depict i have love the west for it vastness it contrast it beauty and color and life for it wildness and violence and for the fact that i have see how it develop great men and woman who die unknown and unsung in this materialistic age this hard practical swift greedy age of realism it seem there be no place for writer of romance no place for romance itself for many year all the event lead up to the great war be realistic and the war itself be horribly realistic and the aftermath be likewise romance be only another name for idealism and i contend that life without ideal be not worth live never in the history of the world be ideal need so terribly a now walter scott write romance so do victor hugo and likewise kipling hawthorne stevenson it be stevenson particularly who wield a bludgeon against the realist people live for the dream in their heart and i have yet to know anyone who have not some secret dream some hope however dim some storied wall to look at in the dusk some paint window lead to the soul how strange indeed to find that the realist have ideal and dream to read them one would think their life hold nothing significant but they love they hope they dream they sacrifice they struggle on with that dream in their heart just the same a others we all be dreamer if not in the heavy lidded waste of time then in the mean of life that make u work on it be wordsworth who write the world be too much with u and if i could give the secret of my ambition a a novelist in a few word it would be contain in that quotation my inspiration to write have always come from nature character and action be subordinate to set in all that i have do i have try to make people see how the world be too much with them get and spend they lay waste their power with never a breath of the free and wonderful life of the open so i come back to the main point of this foreword in which i be try to tell why and how i come to write the story of a feud notorious in arizona a the pleasant valley war some year ago mr harry adam a cattleman of vermajo park new mexico tell me he have be in the tonto basin of arizona and think i might find interest material there concern this pleasant valley war his version of the war between cattleman and sheepman certainly determine me to look over the grind my old guide al doyle of flagstaff have lead me over half of arizona but never down into that wonderful wild and rugged basin between the mogollon mesa and the mazatzal mountain doyle have long live on the frontier and his version of the pleasant valley war differ markedly from that of mr adam i ask other old timer about it and their remark far excite my curiosity once down there doyle and i find the wild most rugged rough and most remarkable country either of u have visit and the few inhabitant be like the country i go in ostensibly to hunt bear and lion and turkey but what i really be hunt for be the story of that pleasant valley war i engage the service of a bear hunter who have three strap son a reserve and strange and aloof a he be no wheel track of any kind have ever come within mile of their cabin i spend two wonderful month hunt game and revel in the beauty and grandeur of that rim rock country but i come out know no more about the pleasant valley war these texan and their few neighbor likewise from texas do not talk but all i saw and felt only inspire me the more this trip be in the fall of the next year i go again with the best horse outfit and men the doyles could provide and this time i do not ask any question but i ride horse some of them too wild for me and pack a rifle many a hundred mile rid sometimes thirty and forty mile a day and i climb in and out of the deep canyon desperately stay at the heel of one of those long legged texan i learn the life of those backwoodsman but i do not get the story of the pleasant valley war i have however win the friendship of that hardy people in i go back with a still large outfit equip to stay a long a i like and this time without my ask it different native of the tonto come to tell me about the pleasant valley war no two of them agree on anything concern it except that only one of the active participant survive the fight whence come my title to the last man thus i be swamp in a mass of material out of which i could only flounder to my own conclusion some of the story tell me be singularly tempt to a novelist but though i believe them myself i can not risk their improbability to those who have no idea of the wildness of wild men at a wild time there really be a terrible and bloody feud perhaps the most deadly and least know in all the annals of the west i saw the grind the cabin the graf all so darkly suggestive of what must have happen i never learn the truth of the cause of the pleasant valley war or if i do hear it i have no mean of recognize it all the give cause be plausible and convince strange to state there be still secrecy and reticence all over the tonto basin a to the fact of this feud many descendent of those kill be live there now but no one like to talk about it assuredly many of the incident tell me really occur a for example the terrible one of the two woman in the face of relentless enemy save the body of their dead husband from be devour by wild hog suffice it to say that this romance be true to my conception of the war and i base it upon the set i learn to know and love so well upon the strange passion of primitive people and upon my instinctive reaction to the fact and rumor that i gather zane grey avalon california april chapter i at the end of a dry uphill ride over barren country

this history have business the dover road lay a to him beyond the dover mail a it lumber up shooter ’ s hill he walk up hill in the mire by the side of the mail a the rest of the passenger do not because they have the least relish for walk exercise under the circumstance but because the hill and the harness and the mud and the mail be all so heavy that the horse have three time already come to a stop besides once draw the coach across the road with the mutinous intent of take it back to blackheath rein and whip and coachman and guard however in combination have read that article of war which forbid a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument that some brute animal be endue with reason and the team have capitulate and return to their duty with droop head and tremulous tail they mash their way through the thick mud flounder and stumble between while a if they be fall to piece at the large joint a often a the driver rest them and bring them to a stand with a wary “ wo ho

passenger start a a nervous passenger might and be disturb in mind there be a steam mist in all the hollow and it have roam in it forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seek rest and find none a clammy and intensely cold mist it make it slow way through the air in ripple that visibly follow and overspread one another a the wave of an unwholesome sea might do it be dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach lamp but these it own work and a few yard of road and the reek of the labour horse steam into it a if they have make it all two other passenger besides the one be plodding up the hill by the side of the mail all three be wrap to the cheekbone and over the ear and wear jack boot not one of the three could have say from anything he saw what either of the other

notice for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robber a to the latter when every post house and ale house could produce somebody in “ the captain ’ s ” pay range from the landlord to the low stable non descript it be the likeliest thing upon the card so the guard of the dover mail think to himself that friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and seventy five lumber up shooter ’ s hill a he stand on his own particular perch behind the mail beat his foot and keep an eye and a hand on the arm chest before him where a load blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight load horse pistol deposit on a substratum of cutlas the dover mail be in it usual genial position that the guard suspect the passenger the passenger suspect one another and the guard they all suspect everybody else and the coachman be sure of nothing but the horse a to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have take his oath on the two testament that they be not fit for the journey “ wo ho ” say the coachman “ so then one more pull and you ’ re at the top and be damned to you for i have have trouble enough to get you to it joe ” “ halloa ” the guard reply “ what o ’ clock do you make it joe ” “ ten minute good past eleven ” “ my blood ” ejaculate the vex coachman “ and not atop of shooter ’ s yet tst yah get on with you ” the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decide negative make a decide scramble for it and the three other horse follow suit once more the dover mail struggle on with the jack boot of it passenger squash along by it side they have stop when the coach stop and they keep close company with it if any one of the three have have the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way of get shoot instantly a a highwayman the last burst carry the mail to the summit of the hill the horse stop to breathe again and the guard get down to skid the wheel for the descent and open the coach door to let the passenger in “ tst joe ” cry the coachman in a warn voice look down from his box “ what do you say tom ” they both listen “ i say a horse at a canter come up joe ” “ i say a horse at a gallop tom ” return the guard leave his hold of the door and mount nimbly to his place “ gentleman in the king ’ s name all of you ” with this hurry adjuration he cock his blunderbuss and stand on the offensive the passenger book by this history be on the coach step get in the two other passenger be close behind him and about to follow he remain on the step half in the coach and half out of they remain in the road below him they all look from the coachman to the guard and from the guard to the coachman and listen the coachman look back and the guard look back and even the emphatic leader prick up his ear and look back without contradict the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumble and labour of the coach add to the stillness of the night make it very quiet indeed the panting of the horse communicate a tremulous motion to the coach a if it be in a state of agitation the heart of the passenger beat loud enough perhaps to be hear but at any rate the quiet pause be audibly expressive of people out of breath and hold the breath and have the pulse quicken by expectation the sound of a horse at a gallop come fast and furiously up the hill “ so ho ” the guard sing out a loud a he could roar “ yo there stand i shall fire ” the pace be suddenly check and with much splash and flounder a man ’ s voice call from the mist “ be that the dover mail ” “ never you mind what it be ” the guard retort “ what be you ” “ be that the dover mail ” “ why do you want to know ” “ i want a passenger if it be ” “ what passenger ” “ mr jarvis lorry ” our book passenger show in a moment that it be his name the guard the coachman and the two other passenger eye him distrustfully “ keep where you be ” the guard call to the voice in the mist “ because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right in your lifetime gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight ” “ what be the matter ” ask the passenger then with mildly quaver speech “ who want me be it jerry ” “ i don ’ t like jerry ’ s voice if it be jerry ” growl the guard to himself “ he ’ s hoarser than suit me be jerry ” “ yes mr lorry ” “ what be the matter ” “ a despatch send after you from over yonder t and co ” “ i know this messenger guard ” say mr lorry get down into the road assist from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passenger who immediately scramble into the coach shut the door and pull up the window “ he may come close there ’ s nothing wrong ” “ i hope there ain ’ t but i can ’ t make so ‘ nation sure of that ” say the guard in gruff soliloquy “ hallo you ” “ well and hallo you ” say jerry more hoarsely than before “ come on at a footpace d ’ ye mind me and if you ’ ve get holster to that saddle o ’ yourn don ’ t let me see your hand go nigh ‘ em for i ’ m a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it take the form of lead so now let ’ s look at you ” the figure of a horse and rider come slowly through the eddy mist and come to the side of the mail where the passenger stand the rider stoop and cast up his eye at the guard hand the passenger a small fold paper the rider ’ s horse be blow and both horse and rider be cover with mud from the hoof of the horse to the hat of the man “ guard ” say the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raise blunderbuss his leave at the barrel and his eye on the horseman answer curtly “ sir ” “ there be nothing to apprehend i belong to tellson ’ s bank you must know tellson ’ s bank in london i be go to paris on business a crown to drink i may read this ” “ if so be a you ’ re quick sir ” he open it in the light of the coach lamp on that side and read first to himself and then aloud “ ‘ wait at dover for mam ’ selle ’ it ’ s not long you see guard jerry say that my answer be recall to life ” jerry start in his saddle “ that ’ s a blaze strange answer too ” say he at his hoarsest “ take that message back and they will know that i receive this a well a if i write make the best of your way good night ” with those word the passenger open the coach door and get in not at all assist by his fellow passenger who have expeditiously secrete their watch and purse in their boot and be now make a general pretence of be asleep with no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originate any other kind of action the coach lumber on again with heavy wreath of mist close round it a it begin the descent the guard soon replace his blunderbuss in his arm chest and have look to the rest of it content and have look to the supplementary pistol that he wear in his belt look to a small chest beneath his seat in which there be a few smith ’ s tool a couple of torch and a tinder box for he be furnish with that completeness

57,charlesDickens_americanNotes,charles_dickens,105304,﻿ chapter i go away i shall never forget the one fourth serious and three fourth comical astonishment with which on the morning of the third of january eighteen hundred and forty two i open the door of and put my head into a ‘ state room ’ on board the britannia steam packet twelve hundred ton burthen per register bind for halifax and boston and carry her majesty ’ s mail that this state room have be specially engage for ‘ charles dickens esquire and lady ’ be render sufficiently clear even to my scar intellect by a very small manuscript announce the fact which be pin on a very flat quilt cover a very thin mattress spread like a surgical plaster on a most inaccessible shelf but that this be the state room concern which charles dickens esquire and lady have hold daily and nightly conference for at least four month precede that this could by any possibility be that small snug chamber of the imagination which charles dickens esquire with the spirit of prophecy strong upon him have always foretell would contain at least one little sofa and which his lady with a modest yet most magnificent sense of it limit dimension have from the first opine would not hold more than two enormous portmanteau in some odd corner out of sight portmanteau which could now no more be get in at the door not to say stow away than a giraffe could be persuade or force into a flower pot that this utterly impracticable thoroughly hopeless and profoundly preposterous box have the remote reference to or connection with those chaste and pretty not to say gorgeous little bower sketch by a masterly hand in the highly varnish lithographic plan hang up in the agent ’ s count house in the city of london that this room of state in short could be anything but a pleasant fiction and cheerful jest of the captain ’ s invent and put in practice for the well relish and enjoyment of the real state room presently to be disclose —these be truth which i really could not for the moment bring my mind at all to bear upon or comprehend and i sit down upon a kind of horsehair slab or perch of which there be two within and look without any expression of countenance whatever at some friend who have come on board with u and who be crush their face into all manner of shape by endeavour to squeeze them through the small doorway we have experience a pretty smart shock before come below which but that we be the most sanguine people live might have prepare u for the worst the imaginative artist to whom i have already make allusion have depict in the same great work a chamber of almost interminable perspective furnish a mr robin would say in a style of more than eastern splendour and fill but not inconveniently so with group of lady and gentleman in the very high state of enjoyment and vivacity before descend into the bowel of the ship we have pass from the deck into a long narrow apartment not unlike a gigantic hearse with window in the side have at the upper end a melancholy stove at which three or four chilly steward be warming their hand while on either side extend down it whole dreary length be a long long table over each of which a rack fix to the low roof and stick full of drink glass and cruet stand hint dismally at roll sea and heavy weather i have not at that time see the ideal presentment of this chamber which have since gratify me so much but i observe that one of our friend who have make the arrangement for our voyage turn pale on enter retreat on the friend behind him smite his forehead involuntarily and say below his breath ‘ impossible it can not be ’ or word to that effect he recover himself however by a great effort and after a preparatory cough or two cry with a ghastly smile which be still before me look at the same time round the wall ‘ ha the breakfast room steward—eh ’ we all foresee what the answer must be we know the agony he suffer he have often speak of the saloon have take in and live upon the pictorial idea have usually give u to understand at home that to form a just conception of it it would be necessary to multiply the size and furniture of an ordinary draw room by seven and then fall short of the reality when the man in reply avow the truth the blunt remorseless naked truth ‘ this be the saloon sir ’ —he actually reel beneath the blow in person who be so soon to part and interpose between their else daily communication the formidable barrier of many thousand mile of stormy space and who be for that reason anxious to cast no other cloud not even the pass shadow of a moment ’ s disappointment or discomfiture upon the short interval of happy companionship that yet remain to them—in person so situate the natural transition from these first surprise be obviously into peal of hearty laughter and i can report that i for one be still seat upon the slab or perch before mention roar outright until the vessel ring again thus in less than two minute after come upon it for the first time we all by common consent agree that this state room be the pleasant and most facetious and capital contrivance possible and that to have have it one inch large would have be quite a disagreeable and deplorable state of thing and with this and with show how —by very nearly close the door and twin in and out like serpent and by count the little wash slab a stand room —we could manage to insinuate four people into it all at one time and entreat each other to observe how very airy it be in dock and how there be a beautiful port hole which could be keep open all day weather permit and how there be quite a large bull ’ s eye just over the look glass which would render shave a perfectly easy and delightful process when the ship didn ’ t roll too much we arrive at last at the unanimous conclusion that it be rather spacious than otherwise though i do verily believe that deduct the two berth one above the other than which nothing small for sleeping in be ever make except coffin it be no big than one of those hackney cabriolet which have the door behind and shoot their fare out like sack of coal upon the pavement have settle this point to the perfect satisfaction of all party concern and unconcerned we sit down round the fire in the lady ’ cabin—just to try the effect it be rather dark certainly but somebody say ‘ of course it would be light at sea ’ a proposition to which we all assent echo ‘ of course of course ’ though it would be exceedingly difficult to say why we think so i remember too when we have discover and exhaust another topic of consolation in the circumstance of this lady ’ cabin adjoin our state room and the consequently immense feasibility of sit there at all time and season and have fall into a momentary silence lean our face on our hand and look at the fire one of our party say with the solemn air of a man who have make a discovery ‘ what a relish mull claret will have down here ’ which appear to strike u all most forcibly a though there be something spicy and high flavour in cabin which essentially improve that composition and render it quite incapable of perfection anywhere else there be a stewardess too actively engage in produce clean sheet and table cloth from the very entrails of the sofa and from unexpected locker of such artful mechanism that it make one ’ s head ache to see them open one after another and render it quite a distract circumstance to follow her proceed and to find that every nook and corner and individual piece of furniture be something else besides what it pretend to be and be a mere trap and deception and place of secret stowage whose ostensible purpose be it least useful one god bless that stewardess for her piously fraudulent account of january voyage god bless her for her clear recollection of the companion passage of last year when nobody be ill and everybody dance from morning to night and it be ‘ a run ’ of twelve day and a piece of the pure frolic and delight and jollity all happiness be with her for her bright face and her pleasant scotch tongue which have sound of old home in it for my fellow traveller and for her prediction of fair wind and fine weather all wrong or i shouldn ’ t be half so fond of her and for the ten thousand small fragment of genuine womanly tact by which without piece them elaborately together and patch them up into shape and form and case and point application she nevertheless do plainly show that all young mother on one side of the atlantic be near and close at hand to their little child leave upon the other and that what seem to the uninitiated a serious journey be to those who be in the secret a mere frolic to be sing about and whistle at light be her heart and gay her merry eye for year the state room have grow pretty fast but by this time it have expand into something quite bulky and almost boast a bay window to view the sea from so we go upon deck again in high spirit and there everything be in such a state of bustle and active preparation that the blood quicken it pace and whirl through one ’ s vein on that clear frosty morning with involuntary mirthfulness for every gallant ship be rid slowly up and down and every little boat be splash noisily in the water and knot of people stand upon the wharf gaze with a kind of ‘ dread delight ’ on the far famed fast american steamer and one party of men be ‘ take in the milk ’ or in other word get the cow on board and another be fill the icehouse to the very throat with fresh provision with butcher ’ meat and garden stuff pale suck pig calf ’ head in score beef veal and pork and poultry out of all proportion and others be coil rope and busy with oakum yarn and others be lower heavy package into the hold and the purser ’ s head be barely visible a it loom in a state of exquisite perplexity from the midst of a vast pile of passenger ’ luggage and there seem to be nothing go on anywhere or uppermost in the mind of anybody but preparation for this mighty voyage this with the bright cold sun the brace air the crisply curl water the thin white crust of morning ice upon the deck which crackle with a sharp and cheerful sound beneath the light tread be irresistible and when again upon the shore we turn and saw from the vessel ’ s mast her name signal in flag of joyous colour and flutter by their side the beautiful american banner with it star and strip —the long three thousand mile and more and long still the six whole month of absence so dwindle and fade that the ship have go out and come home again and it be broad spring already in the coburg dock at liverpool i have not inquire among my medical acquaintance whether turtle and cold punch with hock champagne and claret and all the slight et cetera usually include in an unlimited order for a good dinner—especially when it be leave to the liberal construction of my faultless friend mr radley of the adelphi hotel—are peculiarly calculate to suffer a sea change or whether a plain mutton chop and a glass or two of sherry would be less likely of conversion into foreign and disconcert material my own opinion be that whether one be discreet or indiscreet in these particular on the eve of a sea voyage be a matter of little consequence and that to use a common phrase ‘ it come to very much the same thing in the end ’ be this a it may i know that the dinner of that day be undeniably perfect that it comprehend all these item and a great many more and that we all do ample justice to it and i know too that bat a certain tacit avoidance of any allusion to to morrow such a may be suppose to prevail between delicate mind turnkey and a sensitive prisoner who be to be hang next morning we get on very well and all thing consider be merry enough when the morning— the morning—came and we meet at breakfast it be curious to see how eager we all be to prevent a moment ’ s pause in the conversation and how astoundingly gay everybody be the force spirit of each member of the little party have a much likeness to his natural mirth a hot house pea at five guinea the quart resemble in flavour the growth of the dew and air and rain of heaven but a one o ’ clock the hour for go aboard draw near this volubility dwindle away by little and little despite the most persevere effort to the contrary until at last the matter be now quite desperate we throw off all disguise openly speculate upon where we should be this time to morrow this time next day and so forth and entrust a vast number of message to those who intend return to town that night which be to be deliver at home and elsewhere without fail within the very short possible space of time after the arrival of the railway train at euston square and commission and remembrance do so crowd upon one at such a

he be ‘ go across ’ —as if it be a ferry—even he condescend to look that way and nod his head a who should say ‘ no mistake about that ’ and not even the sage lord burleigh in his nod include half so

madly bend upon opening lock door and on force a passage into all kind of out of the way place where there be no thoroughfare send wild steward with elfin hair to and fro upon the breezy deck on unintelligible errand impossible of execution and in short create the most extraordinary and bewilder tumult in the midst of all this the lazy gentleman who seem to have no luggage of any kind—not so much a a friend even—lounges up and down the hurricane deck coolly puff a cigar and a this unconcerned demeanour again exalt him in the opinion of those who have leisure to observe his proceed

lazy man would care to count on a sunny day huge zig zag chimney out of which it seem a though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shape impart to it in it tortuous progress and vast stable gloomy ruinous and empty the place be say to have be build in the day of king henry the eighth and there be a legend not only that queen elizabeth have sleep there one night while upon a hunt excursion to wit in a certain oak panel room with a deep bay window but that next morning while stand on a mount block before the door with one foot in the stirrup the virgin monarch have then and there box and cuff an unlucky page for some neglect of duty the matter of fact and doubtful folk of whom there be a few among the maypole customer a unluckily there always be in every little community be incline to look upon this tradition a rather apocryphal but whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appeal to the mount block itself a evidence and triumphantly point out that there it stand in the same place to that very day the doubter never fail to be put down by a large majority and all true believer exult a in a victory whether these and many other story of the like nature be true or untrue the maypole be really an old house a very old house perhaps a old a it claim to be and perhaps old which will sometimes happen with house of an uncertain a with lady of a certain age it window be old diamond pane lattice it floor be sink and uneven it ceiling blacken by the hand of time and heavy with massive beam over the doorway be an ancient porch quaintly and grotesquely carve and here on summer evening the more favour customer smoke and drink ay and sing many a good song too sometimes repose on two grim look high back settle which like the twin dragon of

lull it to rest with it overhang story drowsy little pane of glass and front bulge out and project over the pathway the old house look a if it be nod in it sleep indeed it need no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblance to humanity the brick of which it be build have originally be a deep dark red but have grow yellow and discolour like an old man ’ s skin the sturdy timber have decay like teeth and here and there the ivy like a warm garment to comfort it in it age wrapt it green leave closely round the time wear wall it be a hale and hearty age though still and in the summer or autumn evening when the glow of the set sun fell upon the oak and chestnut tree of the adjacent forest the old house partake of it lustre seem their fit companion and to have many good year of life in him yet the evening with which we have to do be neither a summer nor an autumn one but the twilight of a day in march when the wind howl dismally among the bare branch of the tree and rumble in the wide chimney and drive the rain against the window of the maypole inn give such of it frequenter a chance to be there at the moment an undeniable reason for prolong their stay and cause the landlord to prophesy that the night would certainly clear at eleven o ’ clock precisely which by a remarkable coincidence be the hour at which he always close his house the name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy thus descend be john willet a burly large head man with a fat face which betoken profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehension combine with a very strong reliance upon his own merit it be john willet ’ s ordinary boast in his more placid mood that if he be slow he be sure which assertion could in one sense at least be by no mean gainsay see that he be in everything unquestionably the reverse of fast and withal one of the most dog and positive fellow in existence always sure that what he think or say or do be right and hold it a a thing quite settle and ordain by the law of nature and providence that anybody who say or do or think otherwise must be inevitably and of necessity wrong mr willet walk slowly up to the window flatten his fat nose against the cold glass and shade his eye that his sight might not be affect by the ruddy glow of the fire look abroad then he walk slowly back to his old seat in the chimney corner and compose himself in it with a slight shiver such a a man might give way to and so acquire an additional relish for the warm blaze say look round upon his guest ‘ it ’ ll clear at eleven o ’ clock no sooner and no late not before and not arterwards ’ ‘ how do you make out that ’ say a little man in the opposite corner ‘ the moon be past the full and she rise at nine ’ john look sedately and solemnly at his questioner until he have bring his mind to bear upon the whole of his observation and then make answer in a tone which seem to imply that the moon be peculiarly his business and nobody else ’ s ‘ never you mind about the moon don ’ t you trouble yourself about her you let the moon alone and i ’ ll let you alone ’ ‘ no offence i hope ’ say the little man again john wait leisurely until the observation have thoroughly penetrate to his brain and then reply ‘ no offence a yet ’ apply a light to his pipe and smoke in placid silence now and then cast a sidelong look at a man wrap in a loose rid coat with huge cuff ornament with tarnish silver lace and large metal button who sit apart from the regular frequenter of the house and wear a hat flap over his face which be still far shade by the hand on which his forehead rest look unsociable enough there be another guest who sit boot and spur at some distance from the fire also and whose thought to judge from his fold arm and knit brow and from the untasted liquor before him be occupy with other matter than the topic under discussion or the person who discuss them this be a young man of about eight and twenty rather above the middle height and though of somewhat slight figure gracefully and strongly make he wear his own dark hair and be accoutre in a rid dress which together with his large boot resemble in shape and fashion those wear by our life guardsman at the present day show indisputable trace of the bad condition of the road but travel stain though he be he be well and even richly attire and without be overdress look a gallant gentleman lie upon the table beside him a he have carelessly throw them down be a heavy rid whip and a slouch hat the latter wear no doubt a be best suit to the inclemency of the weather there too be a pair of pistol in a holster case and a short rid cloak little of his face be visible except the long dark lash which conceal his downcast eye but an air of careless ease and natural gracefulness of demeanour pervade the figure and seem to comprehend even those slight accessory which be all handsome and in good keep towards this young gentleman the eye of mr willet wander but once and then a if in mute inquiry whether he have observe his silent neighbour it be plain that john and the young gentleman have often meet before find that his look be not return or indeed observe by the person to whom it be address john gradually concentrate the whole power of his eye into one focus and bring it to bear upon the man in the flap hat at whom he come to stare in course of time with an intensity so remarkable that it affect his fireside crony who all a with one accord take their pip from their lip and star with open mouth at the stranger likewise

audience do not seem surprise it be possible that life always prolific of incident in a great city like new york might some day produce an occasion which mr faucitt would feel that he could allow to pass without say a few word but nothing of the sort have happen a yet and they have give up hope right from the start of the meal they have felt that it would be optimism run mad to expect the old gentleman to abstain from speech on the night of sally nicholas ’ farewell dinner party and partly because they have brace themselves to it but principally because miss nicholas ’ hospitality have leave them with a genial feel of repletion they settle themselves to listen with something resemble equanimity a movement on the part of the marvellous murphy new arrival who have be play the bushwick

nicholas ” the gentleman refer to who sit at the speaker ’ s end of the table acknowledge the tribute with a brief nod of the head it be a nod of condescension the nod of one who conscious of be hedge about by social inferior nevertheless do his best to be not unkindly and sally see it debate in her mind for an instant the advisability of throw an orange at her brother there be one lie ready to her

riverside drive and revisit the board house for this special occasion and when he have come he have enter wear such faultless evening dress that he have make the rest of the party look like a gather of tramp cyclist his white waistcoat alone be a silent reproach to honest poverty and have cause an awkward constraint right through the soup and fish course most of those present have know fillmore nicholas a an impecunious young man who could make a tweed suit last long than one would have believe possible they have call him “ fill ” and help him in more than usually lean time with small loan but to night they have eye the waistcoat dumbly and shrink back abash “ speak ” say mr faucitt “ a an englishman for though i have long since take out what be technically know a my ‘ paper ’ it be a a subject of the island kingdom that i first visit this great country i may say that the two factor in american life which have always make the profound impression upon me have be the lavishness of american hospitality and the charm of the american girl to night we have be privilege to witness the american girl in the capacity of hostess and i think i be right in say in asseverate in commit myself to the statement that this have be a night which none of u present here will ever forget miss nicholas have give u lady and gentleman a banquet i repeat a banquet there have be alcoholic

listen indefinitely “ miss nicholas ” resume mr faucitt lower his cigar “ but why ” he demand abruptly “ do i call her miss nicholas ” “ because it ’ s her name ” hazard the tall murphy mr faucitt eye him with disfavour he disapprove of the marvellous brother on general ground because himself a resident of year stand he consider that these transient from the vaudeville stage lower the tone of the board house but particularly because the one who have just speak have on his first evening in the place address him a “ grandpa ” “ yes sir ” he say severely “ it be her name but she have another name sweet to those who love her those who worship her those who have watch her with the eye of sedulous affection through the three year she have spend beneath this roof though that name ” say mr faucitt

delightful thing about her and she have mistrust her ability to make a fit reply and it be imperative that a fit reply should proceed from someone she know mr faucitt so well he look on these occasion rather in the light of scene from some play and sustain his own part in them with such polish grace be certain to be pain by anything in the nature of an anti climax after he should have cease to take

practical age all round u we see foreign competition make itself unpleasant and we spend our time play golf what do we get out of it be golf any use that s what i m ask you can you name me a single case where devotion to this pestilential pastime have do a man any practical good the sage smile gently i could name a thousand one will do i will select say the sage from the innumerable memory that rush to my mind the story of cuthbert bank never hear of him be of good cheer say the old member you be go to hear of him now it be in the picturesque little settlement of wood hill say the old member that the incident occur which i be about to relate even if you have never be in wood hill that suburban paradise be probably familiar to you by name situate at a convenient distance from the city it combine in a notable manner the advantage of town life with the pleasant surround and healthful air of the country it inhabitant live in commodious house stand in their own ground and enjoy so many luxury such a gravel soil main drainage electric light telephone bath h and c and company s own water that you might be pardon for imagine life to be so ideal for them that no possible improvement could be add to their lot mr willoughby smethurst be under no such delusion what wood hill need to make it perfect she realize be culture material comfort be all very well but if the summum bonum be to be achieve the soul also demand a look in and it be mr smethurst s unfaltering resolve that never while she have her strength should the soul be hand the loser s end it be her intention to make wood hill a centre of all that be most cultivate and refine and golly how she have succeed under her presidency the wood hill literary and debate society have triple it membership but there be always a fly in the ointment a caterpillar in the salad the local golf club an institution to which mr smethurst strongly object have also triple it membership and the division of the community into two rival camp the golfer and the culture have become more mark than ever this division always acute have attain now to the dimension of a schism the rival sect treat one another with a cold hostility unfortunate episode come to widen the breach mr smethurst s house adjoin the link stand to the right of the fourth tee and a the literary society be in the habit of entertain visit lecturer many a golfer have foozled his drive owe to sudden loud outburst of applause coincide with his down swing and not long before this story open a slice ball whiz in at the open window have come within an ace of incapacitate raymond parsloe devine the rise young novelist who rise at that moment a clear foot and a half from any far exercise of his art two inch indeed to the right and raymond must inevitably have hand in his dinner pail to make matter bad a ring at the front door bell follow almost immediately and the maid usher in a young man of please appearance in a sweater and baggy knickerbockers who apologetically but firmly insist on play his ball where it lay and what with the shock of the lecturer s narrow escape and the spectacle of the intruder stand on the table and work away with a niblick the afternoon s session have to be class a a complete frost mr devine s determination from which no argument could swerve him to deliver the rest of his lecture in the coal cellar give the meet a jolt from which it never recover i have dwell upon this incident because it be the mean of introduce cuthbert bank to mr smethurst s niece adeline a cuthbert for it be he who have so nearly reduce the muster roll of rise novelist by one hop down from the table after his stroke he be suddenly aware that a beautiful girl be look at him intently a a matter of fact everyone in the room be look at him intently none more so than raymond parsloe devine but none of the others be beautiful girl long a the member of wood hill literary society be on brain they be short on look and to cuthbert s excite eye adeline smethurst stand out like a jewel in a pile of coke he have never see her before for she have only arrive at her aunt s house on the previous day but he be perfectly certain that life even when live in the midst of gravel soil main drainage and company s own water be go to be a pretty poor affair if he do not see her again yes cuthbert be in love and it be interest to record a show the effect of the tender emotion on a man s game that twenty minute after he have meet adeline he do the short eleventh in one and a near a a toucher get a three on the four hundred yard twelfth i will skip lightly over the intermediate stage of cuthbert s courtship and come to the moment when at the annual ball in aid of the local cottage hospital the only occasion during the year on which the lion so to speak lay down with the lamb and the golfer and the culture meet on term of easy comradeship their difference temporarily lay aside he propose to adeline and be badly stymie that fair soulful girl could not see him with a spy glass mr bank she say i will speak frankly charge right ahead assent cuthbert deeply sensible a i be of i know of the honour and the compliment and all that but pass lightly over all that guff what seem to be the trouble i love you to distraction love be not everything you re wrong say cuthbert earnestly you re right off it love and he be about to dilate on the theme when she interrupt him i be a girl of ambition and very nice too say cuthbert i be a girl of ambition repeat adeline and i realize that the fulfilment of my ambition must come through my husband i be very ordinary myself what cry cuthbert you ordinary why you be a pearl among woman the queen of your sex you can t have be look in a glass lately you stand alone simply alone you make the rest look like batter repaint well say adeline soften a trifle i believe i be fairly good look anybody who be content to call you fairly good look would describe the taj mahal a a pretty nifty tomb but that be not the point what i mean be if i marry a nonentity i shall be a nonentity myself for ever and i would sooner die than be a nonentity and if i follow your reason you think that that let me out well really mr bank have you do anything or be you likely ever to do anything worth while cuthbert hesitate it s true he say i didn t finish in the first ten in the open and i be knock out in the semi final of the amateur but i win the french open last year the what the french open championship golf you know golf you waste all your time play golf i admire a man who be more spiritual more intellectual a pang of jealousy rent cuthbert s bosom like what s his name devine he say sullenly mr devine reply adeline blush faintly be go to be a great man already he have achieve much the critic say that he be more russian than any other young english writer and be that good of course it s good i should have think the wheeze would be to be more english than any other young english writer nonsense who want an english writer to be english you ve get to be russian or spanish or something to be a real success the mantle of the great russian have descend on mr devine from what i ve hear of russian i should hate to have that happen to me there be no danger of that say adeline scornfully oh well let me tell you that there be a lot more in me than you think that might easily be so you think i m not spiritual and intellectual say cuthbert deeply move very well tomorrow i join the literary society even a he speak the word his leg be itch to kick himself for be such a chump but the sudden expression of pleasure on adeline s face soothe him and he go home that night with the feel that he have take on something rather attractive it be only in the cold grey light of the morning that he realize what he have let himself in for i do not know if you have have any experience of suburban literary society but the one that flourish under the eye of mr willoughby smethurst at wood hill be rather more so than the average with my feeble power of narrative i can not hope to make clear to you all that cuthbert bank endure in the next few week and even if i could i doubt if i should do so it be all very well to excite pity and terror a aristotle recommend but there be limit in the ancient greek tragedy it be an ironclad rule that all the real rough stuff should take place off stage and i shall follow this admirable principle it will suffice if i say merely that j cuthbert bank have a thin time after attend eleven debate and fourteen lecture on vers libre poetry the seventeenth century essayist the neo scandinavian movement in portuguese literature and other subject of a similar nature he grow so enfeeble that on the rare occasion when he have time for a visit to the link he have to take a full iron for his mashie shot it be not simply the oppressive nature of the debate and lecture that sap his vitality what really get right in amongst him be the torture of see adeline s adoration of raymond parsloe devine the man seem to have make the deep possible impression upon her plastic emotion when he speak she lean forward with part lip and look at him when he be not speak which be seldom she lean back and look at him and when he happen to take the next seat to her she lean sideways and look at him one glance at mr devine would have be more than enough for cuthbert but adeline find him a spectacle that never pal she could not have gaze at him with a more rapturous intensity if she have be a small child and he a saucer of ice cream all this cuthbert have to witness while still endeavour to retain the possession of his faculty sufficiently to enable him to duck and back away if somebody suddenly ask him what he think of the sombre realism of vladimir brusiloff it be little wonder that he toss in bed pick at the coverlet through sleepless night and have to have all his waistcoat take in three inch to keep them from sag this vladimir brusiloff to whom i have refer be the famous russian novelist and owe to the fact of his be in the country on a lecture tour at the moment there have be something of a boom in his work the wood hill literary society have be study them for week and never since his first entrance into intellectual circle have cuthbert bank come near to throw in the towel vladimir specialize in grey study of hopeless misery where nothing happen till page three hundred and eighty when the moujik decide to commit suicide it be tough go for a man whose deep read hitherto have be vardon on the push shoot and there can be no great proof of the magic of love than the fact that cuthbert stick it without a cry but the strain be terrible and i be incline to think that he must have crack have it not be for the daily report in the paper of the internecine strife which be proceed so briskly in russia cuthbert be an optimist at heart and it seem to him that at the rate at which the inhabitant of that interest country be murder one another the supply of russian novelist must eventually give out one morning a he totter down the road for the short walk which be now almost the only exercise to which he be equal cuthbert meet adeline a spasm of anguish flit through all his nerve centre a he saw that she be accompany by raymond parsloe devine good morning mr bank say adeline good morning say cuthbert hollowly such good news about vladimir brusiloff dead say cuthbert with a touch of hope dead of course not why should he be no aunt emily meet his manager after his lecture at queen s hall yesterday and he have promise that mr brusiloff shall come to her next wednesday reception oh ah say cuthbert dully i don t know how she manage it i think she must have tell him that mr devine would be there to meet him but you say he be come argue cuthbert i shall be very glad say raymond devine of the opportunity of meet brusiloff i m sure say adeline he will be very glad of the opportunity of meet you possibly say mr devine possibly competent critic have say that my work closely resemble that of the great russian master your psychology be so deep yes yes and your atmosphere quite cuthbert in a perfect agony of spirit prepare to withdraw from this love feast the sun be shin brightly but the world be black to him bird sing in the tree top but he do not hear them he might have be a moujik for all the pleasure he find in life you will be there mr bank say adeline a he turn away oh all right say cuthbert when cuthbert have enter the draw room on the follow wednesday and have take his usual place in a distant corner where while able to feast his gaze on adeline he have a sport chance of be overlook or mistake for a piece of furniture he perceive the great russian thinker seat in the midst of a circle of admire female raymond parsloe devine have not yet arrive his first glance at the novelist surprise cuthbert doubtless with the best motif vladimir brusiloff have permit his face to become almost entirely conceal behind a dense zareba of hair but his eye be visible through the undergrowth and it seem to cuthbert that there be an expression in them not unlike that of a cat in a strange backyard surround by small boy the man look forlorn and hopeless and cuthbert wonder whether he have have bad news from home this be not the case the late news which vladimir brusiloff have have from russia have be particularly cheer three of his principal creditor have perish in the last massacre of the bourgeoisie and a man whom he owe for five year for a samovar and a pair of overshoe have flee the country and have not be hear of since it be not bad news from home that be depress vladimir what be wrong with him be the fact that this be the eighty second suburban literary reception he have be compel to attend since he have land in the country on his lecture tour and he be sick to death of it when his agent have first suggest the trip he have sign on the dot line without an instant s hesitation work out in rouble the fee offer have seem just about right but now a he peer through the brushwood at the face round him and realize that eight out of ten of those present have manuscript of some sort conceal on their person and be only wait for an opportunity to whip them out and start read he wish that he have stay

henry early to avoid disappointment if i simply say he wa a detective and let it go at that i should be obtain the reader s interest under false pretence he wa really only a sort of detective a specie of sleuth at stafford s international investigation bureau in the strand where he wa employ they do not require him to solve mystery which have baffle the police he have never measure a footprint in

usually when he tell girl his profession squeak of amaze admiration greet him now he wa chagrin to perceive in the brown eye that meet his distinct disapproval what s the matter he say a little anxiously for even at this early stage in their acquaintance he wa conscious of a strong desire to win her approval don t you like detective i don t know somehow i shouldn t have think you be one this restore henry s equanimity somewhat naturally a detective doe not want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right at the start i think you win t be offend go on i ve always look on it a rather a sneaky job sneaky moan henry well creep about spy on people henry wa appal she have define his own trade to a nicety there might be detective whose work wa above this reproach but he wa a confirm creeper and he know it it wasn t his fault the bos tell him to creep and he creep if he decline to creep he would be sack instanter it wa hard and yet he felt the sting of her word and in his bosom the first seed of dissatisfaction with his occupation take root you might have think that this frankness on the girl s part would have keep henry from fall in love with her certainly the dignify thing would have be to change his seat at table and take his meal next to someone who appreciate the romance of detective work a little more but no he remain where he wa and presently cupid who never shoot with a sure aim than through the steam of board house hash snip him where he sit he propose to alice weston she refuse him it s not because i m not fond of you i think you re the nice man i ever meet a good deal of assiduous attention have enable henry to win this place in her affection he have work patiently and well before actually put his fortune to the test i d marry you tomorrow if thing be different but i m on the stage and i mean to stick there most of the girl want to get off it but not me and one thing i ll never do be marry someone who isn t in the profession my sister genevieve do and look what happen to her she marry a commercial traveller and take it from me he travel she never saw him for more than five minute in the year except when he wa sell gent s hosiery in the same town where she wa do her refine speciality and then he d just wave his hand and whiz by and start travel again my husband ha get to be close by where i can see him i m sorry henry but i know i m right it seem final but henry do not wholly despair he wa a resolute young man you have to be to wait outside restaurant in the rain for any length of time he have an inspiration he seek out a dramatic agent i want to go on the stage in musical comedy let s see you dance i can t dance sing say the agent stop sing add the agent hastily you go away and have a nice cup of hot tea

wa talk into the telephone he replace the receiver a henry enter oh rice here s a woman want her husband shadow while he s on the road he s an actor i m send you go to this address and get photograph and all particular you ll have to catch the eleven o clock train on friday yes sir he s in the girl from brighton company they open at bristol it sometimes seem to henry a if fate do it on purpose if the commission have have to do with any other company it would have be well enough for professionally speak it wa the most important with which he have ever be entrust if he have never meet alice weston and hear her view upon detective work he would have be please and flat thing be a they be it wa henry s consider opinion that fate have slip one over on him in the first place what torture to be always near her unable to reveal himself to watch her while she disport herself in the company of other men he would be disguise and she would not recognize him but he would recognize her and his suffer would be dreadful in the second place to have to do his creep about and spy practically in her presence still business wa business at five minute to eleven on the morning name he wa at the station a false beard and spectacle shielding his identity from the public eye if you have ask him he would have say that he wa a scotch business man a a matter of fact he look far more like a motor car come through a haystack the platform wa crowd friend of the company have come to see the company off henry look on discreetly from behind a stout porter whose bulk form a capital screen in spite of himself he wa impress the stage at close quarter always thrill him he recognize celebrity the fat man in the brown suit wa walter jelliffe the comedian and star of the company he star keenly at him through the spectacle others of the famous be scatter about he saw alice she wa talk to a man with a face like a hatchet and smile too a if she enjoy it behind the mat foliage which he have inflict on his face henry s teeth come together with a snap in the week that follow a he dog the girl from brighton company from town to town it would be difficult to say whether henry wa happy or unhappy on the one hand to realize that alice wa so near and yet so inaccessible wa a constant source of misery yet on the other he could not but admit that he wa have the very dickens of a time loaf round the country like this he wa make for this sort of life he consider fate have place him in a london office but what he really enjoy wa this unfettered travel some gipsy strain in him render even the obvious discomfort of theatrical tour agreeable he like catch train he like invade strange hotel above all he revel in the artistic pleasure of watch unsuspecting fellow men a if they be so many ant that wa really the best part of the whole thing it wa all very well for alice to talk about creep and spy but if you consider it without bias there wa nothing degrade about it at all it wa an art it take brain and a genius for disguise to make a man a successful creeper and spyer you couldn t simply say to yourself i will creep if you attempt to do it in your own person you would be detect instantly you have to be an adept at mask your personality you have to be one man at bristol and another quite different man at hull especially if like henry you be of a gregarious disposition and like the society of actor the stage have always fascinate henry to meet even minor member of the profession off the board give him a thrill there wa a rest juvenile of fit up calibre at his board house who could always get a shilling out of him simply by talk about how he have jump in and save the show at the hamlet which he have visit in the course of his wander and on this girl from brighton tour he wa in constant touch with men who really amount to something walter jelliffe have be a celebrity when henry wa go to school and sidney crane the baritone and others of the lengthy cast be all player not unknown in london henry court them assiduously it have not be hard to scrape acquaintance with them the principal of the company always put up at the best hotel and his expense be pay by his employer so do henry it wa the easy thing possible to bridge with a well time whisky and soda the gulf between non acquaintance and warm friendship walter jelliffe in particular wa peculiarly accessible every time henry accost him a a different individual of course and renew in a fresh disguise the friendship which he have enjoy at the last town walter jelliffe meet him more than half way it wa in the sixth week of the tour that the comedian promote him from mere casual acquaintanceship invite him to come up to his room and smoke a cigar henry wa please and flat jelliffe wa a personage always surround by admirer and the compliment wa consequently of a high order he light his cigar among his friend at the green room club it wa unanimously hold that walter jelliffe s cigar bring him within the scope of the law forbid the carry of conceal weapon but henry would have smoke the gift of such a man if it have be a cabbage leaf he puff away contentedly he wa make up a an old indian colonel that week and he compliment his host on the aroma with a fine old world courtesy walter jelliffe seem gratify quite comfortable he ask quite i thank you say henry fondling his silver moustache that s right and now tell me old man which of u be it you re trail henry nearly swallow his cigar what do you mean oh come protest jelliffe there s no need to keep it up with me i know you re a detective the question be who s the man you re after that s what we ve all be wonder all this time all they have all be wonder it wa bad than henry could have imagine till now he have picture his position with regard to the girl from brighton company rather a that of some scientist who see but unseen keep a watchful eye on the denizen of a drop of water under his microscope and they have all detect him every one of them it wa a stun blow if there wa one thing on which henry pride himself it wa the impenetrability of his disguise he might be slow he might be on the stupid side but he could disguise himself he have a variety of disguise each design to befog the public more hopelessly than the last go down the street you would meet a typical commercial traveller dapper and alert anon you encounter a heavily beard australian late maybe it wa a courteous old retire colonel who stop you and inquire the way to trafalgar square still late a rather flashy individual of the sport type ask you for a match for his cigar would you have suspect for one instant that each of these widely differ personality wa in reality one man certainly you would henry do not know it but he have achieve in the eye of the small servant who answer the front door bell at his board house a well establish reputation a a humorist of the more practical kind it wa his habit to try his disguise on her he would ring the bell inquire for the landlady and when bella have go leap up the stair to his room here he would remove the disguise resume his normal appearance and come downstairs again hum a careless air bella meanwhile in the kitchen would be confide to her ally the cook that mr rice have jest come in lookin sort o funny again he sit and gap at walter jelliffe the comedian regard him curiously you look at least a hundred year old he say what be you make up a a piece of gorgonzola henry glance hastily at the mirror yes he do look rather old he must have overdo some of the line on his forehead he look something between a youngish centenarian and a nonagenarian who have see a good deal of trouble if you know how you be demoralize the company jelliffe go on you would drop it a steady and quiet a lot of boy a ever you meet till you come along now they do nothing but bet on what disguise you re go to choose for the next town i don t see why you need to change so often you be all right a the scotchman at bristol we be all say how nice you look you should have stick to that but what do you do at hull but roll in in a scrubby moustache and a tweed suit look rotten however all that be beside the point it s a free country if you like to spoil your beauty i suppose there s no law against it what i want to know be who s the man whose track be you sniff on bill you ll pardon my call you bill you re know a bill the bloodhound in the company who s the man never mind say henry he wa aware a he make it that it wa not a very able retort but he wa feel too limp for satisfactory repartee criticism in the bureau deal with his allege solidity of skull he do not resent he attribute them to man s natural desire to chaff his fellow man but to be unmask by the general public in this way wa another matter it strike at the root of all thing but i do mind object jelliffe it s most important a lot of money hang on it we ve get a sweepstake on in the company the holder of the win name to take the entire receipt come on who be he henry rise and make for the door his feel be too deep for word even a minor detective ha his professional pride and the knowledge that his espionage be be make the basis of sweepstakes by his quarry cut this to the quick here don t go where be you go back to london say henry bitterly it s a lot of good my stay here now isn t it i should say it wa to me don t be in a hurry you re think that now we know all about you your utility a a sleuth ha wan to some extent be that it well well why worry what doe it matter to you you don t get pay by result do you your bos say trail along well do it then i should hate to lose you i don t suppose you know it but you ve be the best mascot this tour that i ve ever come across right from the start we ve be play to enormous business i d rather kill a black cat than lose you drop the disguise and stay with u come behind all you want and be sociable a detective be only human the le of a detective the more human he be henry wa not much of a detective and his human trait be consequently highly develop from a boy he have never be able to resist curiosity if a crowd collect in the street he always add himself to it and he would have stop to gape at a window with watch this window write on it if

up the note carefully and then if i have time i shall have a look at the history of the period i should advise you to do that too oh don t be a goat say pillingshot and he retire brood a before that afternoon he spend industriously copy out the fourth book of the aeneid at the begin of the week he have have a slight disagreement with m gerard the french master pillingshot s view on behaviour and deportment during french lesson do not coincide with those of m gerard pillingshot s idea of a french lesson wa something between a pantomime rally and a scrum at football to him there wa something wonderfully entertain in the process of barge the end man off the edge of the form into space and upset his book over him m gerard however have a very undeveloped sense of humour he warn the humorist twice and on the thing happen a third time suggest that he should go into extra lesson on the ensue wednesday so pillingshot go and copy out virgil he emerge from the room of detention at a quarter past four a he come out into the grind he espy in the middle distance somebody be carry on a stretcher in the direction of the school house at the same moment parker loom in sight walk swiftly towards the school shop his mobile feature shin with the rapt expression of one who see much ginger beer in the near future hullo parker say pillingshot who s the corpse what haven t you hear say parker oh no of course you be in extra it s young brown he s stun or something how do it happen that rotter babington in dacre s simply slam about you know get his eye in before go in and brown walk slap into one of his drive get him on the side of the head much hurt oh no i don t think so keep him out of school for about a week lucky beast wish somebody would come and hit me on the head come and hit me on the head parker come and have an ice say parker right ho say pillingshot it wa one of his peculiarity that whatever the hour or the state of the weather he wa always equal to consume an ice this wa probably due to genius he have an infinite capacity for take pain scarcely wa he outside the promise ice when another misfortune come upon him scott of the first eleven enter the shop pillingshot like scott but he wa not blind to certain flaw in the latter s character for one thing he wa too energetic for another he could not keep his energy to himself he wa always make pillingshot do thing and pillingshot s notion of the ideal life wa complete dolce far niente ginger beer please say scott with parch lip he have be bowling at the net and the day wa hot hullo pillingshot you young slacker why aren t you change be bunk half holiday game you d well reform young man i ve be in extra say pillingshot with dignity how many time doe that make this term you re go for the record aren t you jolly sport of you bit slow in there wasn t it nother ginger beer please just a bit say pillingshot i think so and now you re die for some excitement of course you be well cut over to the house and change and then come back and field at the net the man yorke be go to bowl me some of his celebrate slow tosh and i m go to show him exactly how jessop doe it when he s in form scott wa the big hitter in the school mr yorke wa one of the master he bowl slow leg break mostly half volley and long hop pillingshot have a sort of instinctive idea that field out in the deep with mr yorke bowling and scott bat would not contribute largely to the gaiety of his afternoon field deep at the net mean that you stand in the middle of the football field where there wa no tell what a ball would do if it come at you along the grind if you be lucky you escape without injury generally however the ball bump and deprive you of wind or teeth accord to the height to which it rise he begin politely but firmly to excuse himself don t talk rot say scott complainingly you must have some exercise or you ll go get fat think what a blow it would be to your family pillingshot if you lose your figure buck up if you re back here in a quarter of an hour you shall have another ice a large ice pillingshot price sixpence think of it the word ice a ha be remark before touch chord in pillingshot s nature to which he never turn a deaf ear within the prescribe quarter of an hour he wa back again change here s the ice say scott i ve be keep it warm for you shovel it down i want to be start for the net quicker man quicker don t roll it round your tongue a if it wa port go for it finish that s right come on pillingshot have not finish but scott so evidently believe that he have that it would have be unkind to have mention the fact he follow the smiter to the net if pillingshot have pass the early part of the afternoon in a sedentary fashion he make up for it now scott wa in rare form and pillingshot notice with no small interest that while he invariably hit mr yorke s delivery a quarter of a mile or so he never hit two ball in succession in the same direction a soon a the panting fieldsman have sprint to one side of the football grind and return the ball there wa a beautiful musical plonk and the ball soar to the very opposite quarter of the field it wa a fine exhibition of hit but pillingshot felt that he would have enjoy it more if he could have watch it from a deck chair you re come on a a deep field young pillingshot say scott a he take off his pad you ve get a knack of stop them with your stomach which the best first class field never have you ought to give lesson at it now we ll go and have some tea if pillingshot have have a more intimate acquaintance with the classic he would have observe at this point timeo danaos and make a last dash for liberty in the direction of the shop but he wa deceive by the specious nature of scott s remark vision rise before his eye of sit back in one of scott s armchair watch a fag toast muffin which he would eventually dispatch with languid enjoyment so he follow scott to his study the classical parallel to his situation be the well know case of the oyster they too be eager for the treat they have reach the study and pillingshot wa about to fling himself with a sigh of relief into the most comfortable chair when scott unmask his battery oh by the way he say with a coolness which to pillingshot appear simply brazen i m afraid my fag win t be here today the young crock s go and get mumps or the plague or something so would you mind just light that stove it ll be rather warm but that win t matter there be some muffin in the cupboard you might weigh in with them you ll find the toast fork on the wall somewhere it s hang up get it good man fire away and scott collect five cushion two chair and a tin of mix biscuit and make himself comfortable pillingshot with feel too deep for word in the then limit state of his vocabulary do a he wa request there wa something remarkable about the way scott could always get people to do thing for him he seem to take everything for grant if he have have occasion to hire an assassin to make away with the german emperor he would have say oh i say you might run over to germany and kill the kaiser will you there s a good chap don t be long and he would have take a seat and wait without the least doubt in his mind that the thing would be carry through a desire pillingshot have just finish toast the muffin when the door open and venables of merevale s come in i think i hear you say something about tea this afternoon scott say venables i just look in on the chance good heaven man fancy muffin at this time of year do you happen to know what the thermometer be in the shade take a seat say scott i attribute my entire success in life to the fact that i never find it too hot to eat muffin do you know pillingshot one of the hot fieldsman in the school at least he wa just now he s probably cool off since then venables pillingshot and vice versa buck up with the tea pillingshot what ready good man now we might almost begin beastly thing that accident of young brown s wasn t it say scott chap oughtn t to go slam about like that with the field full of fellow i suppose he win t be right by next saturday not a chance why oh yes i forget he wa to have score for the team at windybury wasn t he who be you go to get now venables wa captain of the st austin s team the match next saturday wa at windybury on the latter s grind i haven t settle say venables but it s easy to get somebody score isn t one of those thing which only one chap in a hundred understand then pillingshot have an idea a great luminous idea may i score he ask and wait trembling with apprehension lest the request be refuse all right say venables i don t see any reason why you shouldn t we have to catch the at the station don t you go miss it or anything rather not say pillingshot not much on saturday morning at exactly mr mellish distribute the livy paper when he arrive at pillingshot s seat and find it empty an expression pass over his face like unto that of the baffle villain in transpontine melodrama where be pillingshot he demand tragically where be he he s go with the team to windybury sir say parker struggle to conceal a large size in grin he s go to score no say mr mellish sadly to himself he ha score the odd trick the attitude of philip st h harrison of merevale s house towards his fellow man wa outwardly one of genial and even sympathetic toleration do his form master intimate that his conduct wa not his idea of what young england s conduct should be p st h harrison agree cheerfully with every word he say warmly approve his intention of lay the matter before the headmaster and accept his punishment with the air of a waiter book an order for a chump chop and fry potato but the next day there would be a squeak desk in the form room just to show the master that he have not be forget or again do the captain of his side at football speak rudely to him on the subject of kick the ball through in the scrum harrison would smile gently and at the early opportunity tread heavily on the captain s toe in short he wa a youth who make a practice of take very good care of himself yet he have his failure the affair of graham s mackintosh wa one of them and it afford an excellent example of the truth of the proverb that a cobbler should stick to his last harrison s forte wa diplomacy when he forsake the art of the diplomatist for those of the brigand he naturally go wrong and the manner of these thing wa thus tony graham wa a prefect in merevale s and part of his duty wa to look after the dormitory of which harrison wa one of the ornament it wa a dormitory that require a good deal of keep in order such choice spirit a braithwaite of the upper fourth and mace who wa rapidly drive the master of the lower fifth into a premature grave need a firm hand indeed they generally need not only a firm hand but a firm hand grasping a serviceable walk stick add to these harrison himself and others of a similar calibre and it will be see that graham s post wa no sinecure it wa harrison s custom to throw off his mask at night with his other garment and appear in his true character of an abandon villain will to stick at nothing a long a he could do it strictly incog in this capacity he have come into constant contact with graham even in the dark it be occasionally possible for a prefect to tell where a noise come from and if the say prefect ha be harass six day in the week by a noise and locate it suddenly on the seventh it be wont to be bad for the producer and patentee of same and so it come about that harrison enjoy himself one night after the manner of his kind wa suddenly drop upon with violence he have construct an ingenious machine consist of a biscuit tin some pebble and some string he put the pebble in the tin tie the string to it and place it under a chest of drawer then he take the other end of the string to bed with him and settle down to make a night of it at first all go well repeat inquiry from tony fail to produce the author of the disturbance and when finally the question cease and the prefect appear to have give the matter up a a bad job p st h harrison begin to feel that under certain circumstance life wa worth live it wa while he wa in this happy frame of mind that the string with which he have just produce a triumphant rattle from beneath the chest of drawer wa seize and the next instant it owner wa enjoy the warm minute of a chequer career tony like brer rabbit have lay low until he wa certain of the direction from which the sound proceed he have then slip out of bed crawl across the floor in a snake
64,pgWodehouse_myManJeeves,pelham_grenville,52841,my man jeeves leave it to jeeves jeeves my man you know be really a most extraordinary chap so capable honestly i shouldn t know what to do without him on broad line he s like those chappies who sit peer sadly over the marble battlement at the pennsylvania station in the place mark inquiry you know the johnny i mean you go up to them and say when s the next train for melonsquashville tennessee and they reply without stop to think two forty three track ten change at san francisco and they re right every time well jeeves give you just the same impression of omniscience a an instance of what i mean i remember meet monty byng in bond street one morning look the last word in a grey check suit and i felt i should never be happy till i have one like it i dig the address of the tailor out of him and have them work on the thing inside the hour jeeves i say that evening i m get a check suit like that one of mr byng s injudicious sir he say firmly it will not become you what absolute rot it s the sound thing i ve strike for year unsuitable for you sir well the long and the short of it wa that the confound thing come home and i put it on and when i catch sight of myself in the glass i nearly swoon jeeves wa perfectly right i look a cross between a music hall comedian and a cheap bookie yet monty have look fine in absolutely the same stuff these thing be just life s mystery and that s all there be to it but it isn t only that jeeves s judgment about clothe be infallible though of course that s really the main thing the man know everything there wa the matter of that tip on the lincolnshire i forget now how i get it but it have the aspect of be the real red hot tabasco jeeves i say for i m fond of the man and like to do him a good turn when i can if you want to make a bit of money have something on wonderchild for the lincolnshire he shake his head i d rather not sir but it s the straight good i m go to put my shirt on him i do not recommend it sir the animal be not intend to win second place be what the stable be after perfect piffle i think of course how the deuce could jeeves know anything about it still you know what happen wonderchild lead till he wa breathe on the wire and then banana fritter come along and nose him out i go straight home and ring for jeeves after this i say not another step for me without your advice from now on consider yourself the brain of the establishment very good sir i shall endeavour to give satisfaction and he ha by jove i m a bit short on brain myself the old bean would appear to have be construct more for ornament than for use don t you know but give me five minute to talk the thing over with jeeves and i m game to advise any one about anything and that s why when bruce corcoran come to me with his trouble my first act wa to ring the bell and put it up to the lad with the bulge forehead leave it to jeeves i say i first get to know corky when i come to new york he wa a pal of my cousin gussie who wa in with a lot of people down washington square way i don t know if i ever tell you about it but the reason why i leave england wa because i wa send over by my aunt agatha to try to stop young gussie marry a girl on the vaudeville stage and i get the whole thing so mix up that i decide that it would be a sound scheme for me to stop on in america for a bit instead of go back and have long cosy chat about the thing with aunt so i send jeeves out to find a decent apartment and settle down for a bit of exile i m bind to say that new york s a top place to be exile in everybody wa awfully good to me and there seem to be plenty of thing go on and i m a wealthy bird so everything wa fine chappies introduce me to other chappies and so on and so forth and it wasn t long before i know squad of the right sort some who roll in dollar in house up by the park and others who live with the gas turn down mostly around washington square artist and writer and so forth brainy cove corky wa one of the artist a portrait painter he call himself but he hadn t paint any portrait he wa sit on the side line with a blanket over his shoulder wait for a chance to get into the game you see the catch about portrait painting i ve look into the thing a bit be that you can t start painting portrait till people come along and ask you to and they win t come and ask you to until you ve paint a lot first this make it kind of difficult for a chappie corky manage to get along by draw an occasional picture for the comic paper he have rather a gift for funny stuff when he get a good idea and do bedstead and chair and thing for the advertisement his principal source of income however wa derive from bite the ear of a rich uncle one alexander worple who wa in the jute business i m a bit foggy a to what jute be but it s apparently something the populace be pretty keen on for mr worple have make quite an indecently large stack out of it now a great many fellow think that have a rich uncle be a pretty soft snap but accord to corky such be not the case corky s uncle wa a robust sort of cove who look like live for ever he wa fifty one and it seem a if he might go to par it wa not this however that distress poor old corky for he wa not bigoted and have no objection to the man go on live what corky kick at wa the way the above worple use to harry him corky s uncle you see didn t want him to be an artist he didn t think he have any talent in that direction he wa always urging him to chuck art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom and work his way up jute have apparently become a sort of obsession with him he seem to attach almost a spiritual importance to it and what corky say wa that while he didn t know what they do at the bottom of the jute business instinct tell him that it wa something too beastly for word corky moreover believe in his future a an artist some day he say he wa go to make a hit meanwhile by use the utmost tact and persuasiveness he wa induce his uncle to cough up very grudgingly a small quarterly allowance he wouldn t have get this if his uncle hadn t have a hobby mr worple wa peculiar in this respect a a rule from what i ve observe the american captain of industry doesn t do anything out of business hour when he ha put the cat out and lock up the office for the night he just relapse into a state of coma from which he emerge only to start be a captain of industry again but mr worple in his spare time wa what be know a an ornithologist he have write a book call american bird and wa write another to be call more american bird when he have finish that the presumption wa that he would begin a third and keep on till the supply of american bird give out corky use to go to him about once every three month and let him talk about american bird apparently you could do what you like with old worple if you give him his head first on his pet subject so these little chat use to make corky s allowance all right for the time be but it wa pretty rotten for the poor chap there wa the frightful suspense you see and apart from that bird except when broil and in the society of a cold bottle bore him stiff to complete the character study of mr worple he wa a man of extremely uncertain temper and his general tendency wa to think that corky wa a poor chump and that whatever step he take in any direction on his own account wa just another proof of his innate idiocy i should imagine jeeves feel very much the same about me so when corky trickle into my apartment one afternoon shoo a girl in front of him and say bertie i want you to meet my fiancée miss singer the aspect of the matter which hit me first wa precisely the one which he have come to consult me about the very first word i speak be corky how about your uncle the poor chap give one of those mirthless laugh he wa look anxious and worry like a man who ha do the murder all right but can t think what the deuce to do with the body we re so scar mr wooster say the girl we be hop that you might suggest a way of break it to him muriel singer wa one of those very quiet appeal girl who have a way of look at you with their big eye a if they think you be the greatest thing on earth and wonder that you hadn t get on to it yet yourself she sit there in a sort of shrink way look at me a if she be say to herself oh i do hope this great strong man isn t go to hurt me she give a fellow a protective kind of feel make him want to stroke her hand and say there there little one or word to that effect she make me feel that there wa nothing i wouldn t do for her she wa rather like one of those innocent taste american drink which creep imperceptibly into your system so that before you know what you re do you re start out to reform the world by force if necessary and pause on your way to tell the large man in the corner that if he look at you like that you will knock his head off what i mean be she make me feel alert and dash like a jolly old knight errant or something of that kind i felt that i wa with her in this thing to the limit i don t see why your uncle shouldn t be most awfully buck i say to corky he will think miss singer the ideal wife for you corky decline to cheer up you don t know him even if he do like muriel he wouldn t admit it that s the sort of pig head guy he be it would be a matter of principle with him to kick all he would consider would be that i have go and take an important step without ask his advice and he would raise cain automatically he s always do it i strain the old bean to meet this emergency you want to work it so that he make miss singer s acquaintance without know that you know her then you come along but how can i work it that way i saw his point that wa the catch there s only one thing to do i say what s that leave it to jeeves and i ring the bell sir say jeeves kind of manifest himself one of the rummy thing about jeeves be that unless you watch like a hawk you very seldom see him come into a room he s like one of those weird chappies in india who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembody way and assemble the part again just where they want them i ve get a cousin who s what they call a theosophist and he say he s often nearly work the thing himself but couldn t quite bring it off probably owe to have fee in his boyhood on the flesh of animal slain in anger and pie the moment i saw the man stand there register respectful attention a weight seem to roll off my mind i felt like a lose child who spot his father in the offing there wa something about him that give me confidence jeeves be a tallish man with one of those dark shrewd face his eye gleam with the light of pure intelligence jeeves we want your advice very good sir i boil down corky s painful case into a few well chosen word so you see what it amount to jeeves we want you to suggest some way by which mr worple can make miss singer s acquaintance without get on to the fact that mr corcoran already know her understand perfectly sir well try to think of something i have think of something already sir you have the scheme i would suggest can not fail of success but it ha what may seem to you a drawback sir in that it require a certain financial outlay he mean i translate to corky that he ha get a pippin of an idea but it s go to cost a bit naturally the poor chap s face drop for this seem to dish the whole thing but i wa still under the influence of the girl s melt gaze and i saw that this wa where i start in a a knight errant you can count on me for all that sort of thing corky i say only too glad carry on jeeves i would suggest sir that mr corcoran take advantage of mr worple s attachment to ornithology how on earth do you know that he wa fond of bird it be the way these new york apartment be construct sir quite unlike our london house the partition between the room be of the flimsy nature with no wish to overhear i have sometimes hear mr corcoran express himself with a generous strength on the subject i have mention oh well why should not the young lady write a small volume to be entitle let u say the child s book of american bird and dedicate it to mr worple a limit edition could be publish at your expense sir and a great deal of the book would of course be give over to eulogistic remark concern mr worple s own large treatise on the same subject i should recommend the dispatch of a presentation copy to mr worple immediately on publication accompany by a letter in which the young lady ask to be allow to make the acquaintance of one to whom she owe so much this would i fancy produce the desire result but a i say the expense involve would be considerable i felt like the proprietor of a perform dog on the vaudeville stage when the tyke ha just pull off his trick without a hitch i have bet on jeeves all along and i have know that he wouldn t let me down it beat me sometimes why a man with his genius be satisfy to hang around press my clothe and what not if i have half jeeves s brain i should have a stab at be prime minister or something jeeves i say that be absolutely rip one of your very best effort thank you sir the girl make an objection but i m sure i couldn t write a book about anything i can t even write good letter muriel s talent say corky with a little cough lie more in the direction of the drama bertie i didn t mention it before but one of our reason for be a trifle nervous a to how uncle alexander will receive the news be that muriel be in the chorus of that show choose your exit at the manhattan it s absurdly unreasonable but we both feel that that fact might increase uncle alexander s natural tendency to kick like a steer i saw what he mean goodness know there wa fuss enough in our family when i try to marry into musical comedy a few year ago and the recollection of my aunt agatha s attitude in the matter of gussie and the vaudeville girl wa still fresh in my mind i don t know why it be one of these psychology sharp could explain it i suppose but uncle and aunt a a class be always dead against the drama legitimate or otherwise they don t seem able to stick it at any price but jeeves have a solution of course i fancy it would be a simple matter sir to find some impecunious author who would be glad to do the actual composition of the volume for a small fee it be only necessary that the young lady s name should appear on the title page that s true say corky sam patterson would do it for a hundred dollar he write a novelette three short story and ten thousand word of a serial for one of the all fiction magazine under different name every month a little

68,andrewLang_yellowBook,andrew_lang,116470,﻿ the yellow fairy book by various edit by andrew lang dedication to joan toddle and tiny book yellow red and green and blue all true or just a good a true and here ’ s the yellow book for you hard be the path from a to z and puzzle to a curly head yet lead to book green blue and red for every child should understand that letter from the first be plan to guide u into fairy land so labour at your alphabet for by that learn shall you get to land where fairy may be meet and go where this pathway go you too at last may find who know the garden of the sing rise preface the editor think that child will readily forgive him for publish another fairy book we have have the blue the red the green and here be the yellow if child be please and they be so kind a to say that they be please the editor do not care very much for what other people may say now there be one gentleman who seem to think that it be not quite right to print so many fairy tale with picture and to publish them in red and blue cover he be name mr g laurence gomme and he be president of a learn body call the folk lore society once a year he make his address to his subject of whom the editor be one and mr joseph jacob who have publish many delightful fairy tale with pretty picture be another fancy then the dismay of mr jacob and of the editor when they hear their president say that he do not think it very nice in them to publish fairy book above all red green and blue fairy book they say that they do not see any harm in it and they be ready to ‘ put themselves on their country ’ and be try by a jury of child and indeed they still see no harm in what they have do nay like father william in the poem they be ready ‘ to do it again and again ’ you may buy them from mr nutt in the strand where be the harm the truth be that the folk lore society make up of the most clever learn and beautiful men and woman of the country be fond of study the history and geography of fairy land this be contain in very old tale such a country people tell and savage ‘ little sioux and little crow little frosty eskimo ’ these people be think to know most about fairyland and it inhabitant but in the yellow fairy book and the rest be many tale by person who be neither savage nor rustic such a madame d ’ aulnoy and herr han christian andersen the folk lore society or it president say that their tale be not so true a the rest and should not be publish with the rest but we say that all the story which be pleasant to read be quite true enough for u so here they be with picture by mr ford and we do not think that either the picture or the story be likely to mislead child a to whether there be really any fairy or not that be a difficult question professor huxley think there be none the editor never saw any himself but he know several people who have see them in the highland and hear their music if ever you be in nether lochaber go to the fairy hill and you may hear the music yourself a grow up people have do but you must goon a fine day again if there be really no fairy why do people believe in them all over the world the ancient greek believe so do the old egyptian and the hindoo and the red indian and be it likely if there be no fairy that so many different people would have see and hear them the rev mr bar gould saw several fairy when he be a boy and be travel in the land of the troubadour for these reason the editor think that there be certainly fairy but they never do anyone any harm and in england they have be frighten away by smoke and schoolmaster a to giant they have die out but real dwarf be common in the forest of africa probably a good many story not perfectly true have be tell about fairy but such story have also be tell about napoleon claverhouse julius caesar and joan of arc all of whom certainly exist a wise child will therefore remember that if he grow up and become a member of the folk lore society all the tale in this book be not offer to him a absolutely truthful but be print merely for his entertainment the exact fact he can learn late or he can leave them alone there be russian german french icelandic red indian and other story here they be translate by miss cheape miss alma and miss thyra alleyne miss sellar mr craigie he do the icelandic tale miss blackley mr dent and mr lang but the red indian story be copy from english version publish by the smithsonian bureau of ethnology in america mr ford do the picture and it be hop that child will find the book not less please than those which have already be

divide them into hermaphrodite monoecious dioecious and polygamous specie this fundamental distinction with the aid of several subdivision in each of the four class will serve my purpose but the classification be artificial and the group often pass into one another the hermaphrodite class contain two interest sub group namely heterostyled and cleistogamic plant but there be several other less important subdivision presently to be give in which flower differ in various way from one another be produce by the same specie some plant be describe by me several year ago in a series of paper read

condition in the specie of primula and on their remarkable sexual relation journal of the proceed of the linnean society volume page on the existence of two form and on their reciprocal sexual relation in several specie of the genus linum ibid volume page on the sexual relation of the three form of lythrum salicaria ibid volume page on the character and hybrid like nature of the offspring from the illegitimate union of dimorphic and trimorphic plant ibid volume page on the specific difference between primula veris brit fl var officinalis linn p vulgaris brit fl var acaulis linn and p elatior jacq and on the hybrid nature of the common oxlip with supplementary remark on naturally produce hybrid in the genus verbascum ibid volume page they be call by me dimorphic and trimorphic but have since be well name by hildebrand heterostyled introduction the term heterostyled do not express all the difference between the form but this be a failure common in many case a the term have be adopt by writer in various country i be unwilling to change it for that of heterogone or heterogonous though this have be propose by so high an authority a professor asa gray see the american naturalist january page a i have many still unpublished observation with respect to these plant it have seem to me advisable to republish my former paper in a connect and correct form together with the new matter it will be show that these heterostyled plant be adapt for reciprocal fertilisation so that the two or three form though all be hermaphrodite be relate to one another almost like the male and female of ordinary unisexual animal i will also give a full abstract of such observation a have be publish since the appearance of my paper but only those case will be notice with respect to which the evidence seem fairly satisfactory some plant have be suppose to be heterostyled merely from their pistil and stamen vary greatly in length and i have be myself more than once thus deceive with some specie the pistil continue grow for a long time so that if old and young flower be compare they might be think to be heterostyled again a specie tend to become dioecious with the stamen reduce in some individual and with the pistil in others often present a deceptive appearance unless it be prove that one form be fully fertile only when it be fertilise with pollen from another form we have not complete evidence that the specie be heterostyled but when the pistil and stamen differ in length in two or three set of individual and this be accompany by a difference in the size of the pollen grain or in the state of the stigma we may infer with much safety that the specie be heterostyled i have however occasionally trust to a difference between the two form in the length of the pistil alone or in the length of the stigma together with it more or less papillose condition and in one instance difference of this kind have be prove by trial make on the fertility of the two form to be sufficient evidence the second sub group above refer to consist of hermaphrodite plant which bear two kind of flower the one perfect and fully expand the other minute completely close with the petal rudimentary often with some of the anther abort and the remain one together with the stigma much reduce in size yet these flower be perfectly fertile they have be call by dr kuhn cleistogamic and they will be describe in the last chapter of this volume introduction botanische zeitung page several plant be know occasionally to produce flower destitute of a corolla but they belong to a different class of case from cleistogamic flower this deficiency seem to result from the condition to which the plant have be subject and partake of the nature of a monstrosity all the flower on the same plant be commonly affect in the same manner such case though they have sometimes be rank a cleistogamic do not come within our present scope see dr maxwell master vegetable teratology page they be manifestly adapt for self fertilisation which be effect at the cost of a wonderfully small expenditure of pollen whilst the perfect flower produce by the same plant be capable of cross fertilisation certain aquatic specie when they flower beneath the water keep their corolla close apparently to protect their pollen they might therefore be call cleistogamic but for reason assign in the proper place be not include in the present sub group several cleistogamic specie a we shall hereafter see bury their ovary or young capsule in the grind but some few other plant behave in the same manner and a they do not bury all their flower they might have form a small separate subdivision another interest subdivision consist of certain plant discover by h muller some individual of which bear conspicuous flower adapt for cross fertilisation by the aid of insect and others much small and less conspicuous flower which have often be slightly modify so a to ensure self fertilisation lysimachia vulgaris euphrasia officinalis rhinanthus crista galli and viola tricolor come under this head introduction h muller nature september volume page and november volume page also die befruchtung der blumen etc page the small and less conspicuous flower be not close but a far a the purpose which they serve be concern namely the assure propagation of the specie they approach in nature cleistogamic flower but they differ from them by the two kind be produce on distinct plant with many plant the flower towards the outside of the inflorescence be much large and more conspicuous than the central one a i shall not have occasion to refer to plant of this kind in the follow chapter i will here give a few detail respect them it be familiar to every one that the ray floret of the compositae often differ remarkably from the others and so it be with the out flower of many umbelliferae some cruciferae and a few other family several specie of hydrangea and viburnum offer strike instance of the same fact the rubiaceous genus mussaenda present a very curious appearance from some of the flower have the tip of one of the sepal develop into a large petal like expansion colour either white or purple the out flower in several acanthaceous genus be large and conspicuous but sterile the next in order be small open moderately fertile and capable of cross fertilisation whilst the central one be cleistogamic be still small close and highly fertile so that here the inflorescence consist of three kind of flower introduction j scott journal of botany london new series volume page from what we know in other case of the use of the corolla colour bracteae etc and from what h muller have observe on the frequency of the visit of insect to the flower head of the umbelliferae and compositae be largely determine by their conspicuousness there can be no doubt that the increase size of the corolla of the out flower the inner one be in all the above case small serve to attract insect introduction die befruchtung der blumen page the result be that cross fertilisation be thus favour most flower wither soon after be fertilise but hildebrand state that the ray floret of the compositae last for a long time until all those on the disc be impregnate and this clearly show the use of the former introduction see his interest memoir ueber die geschlechtsverhaltniss bei den compositen page the ray floret however be of service in another and very different manner namely by fold inwards at night and during cold rainy weather so a to protect the floret of the disc introduction kerner clearly show that this be the case die schutzmittel de pollen page moreover they often contain matter which be excessively poisonous to insect a may be see in the use of flea powder and in the case of pyrethrum m belhomme have show that the ray floret be more poisonous than the disc floret in the ratio of about three to two we may therefore believe that the ray floret be useful in protect the flower from be gnaw by insect introduction gardener s chronicle page lindley vegetable kingdom on chrysanthemum page kerner in his interest essay die schutzmittel der bluthen gegen unberufene gaste page insist that the petal of most plant contain matter which be offensive to insect so that they be seldom gnaw and thus the organ of fructification be protect my grandfather in love of the plant canto note to line remark that the flower or petal of plant be perhaps in general more acrid than their leave hence they be much seldomer eat by insect it be a well know yet remarkable fact that the circumferential flower of many of the forego plant have both their male and female reproductive organ abort a with the hydrangea viburnum and certain compositae or the male organ alone be abort a in many compositae between the sexless female and hermaphrodite state of these latter flower the fine gradation may be trace a hildebrand have show introduction ueber die geschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den compositen page he also show that there be a close relation between the size of the corolla in the ray floret and the degree of abortion in their reproductive organ a we have good reason to believe that these floret be highly serviceable to the plant which possess them more especially by render the flower head conspicuous to insect it be a natural inference that their corolla have be increase in size for this special purpose and that their development have subsequently lead through the principle of compensation or balancement to the more or less complete reduction of the reproductive organ but an opposite view may be maintain namely that the reproductive organ first begin to fail a often happen under cultivation and a a consequence the corolla become through compensation more highly develop introduction i have discuss this subject in my variation of animal and plant under domestication chapter nd edition volume page this view however be not probable for when hermaphrodite plant become dioecious or gyno dioecious that be be convert into hermaphrodite and female the corolla of the female seem to be almost invariably reduce in size in consequence of the abortion of the male organ the difference in the result in these two class of case may perhaps be account for by the matter save through the abortion of the male organ in the female of gyno dioecious and dioecious plant be direct a we shall see in a future chapter to the formation of an increase supply of seed whilst in the case of the exterior floret and flower of the plant which we be here consider such matter be expend in the development of a conspicuous corolla whether in the present class of case the corolla be first affect a seem to me the more probable view or the reproductive organ first fail their state of development be now firmly correlate we see this well illustrate in hydrangea and viburnum for when these plant be cultivate the corolla of both the interior and exterior flower become largely develop and their reproductive organ be abort there be a closely analogous subdivision of plant include the genus muscari or feather hyacinth and the allied bellevalia which bear both perfect flower and close bud like body that never expand the latter resemble in this respect cleistogamic flower but differ widely from them in be sterile and conspicuous not only the abort flower bud and their peduncle which be elongate apparently through the principle of compensation be brightly colour but so be the upper part of the spike all no doubt for the sake of guide insect to the inconspicuous perfect flower from such case a these we may pass on to certain labiatae for instance salvia horminum in which a i hear from mr thiselton dyer the upper bract be enlarge and brightly colour no doubt for the same purpose a before with the flower suppress in the carrot and some allied umbelliferae the central flower have it petal somewhat enlarge and these be of a dark purplish red tint but it can not be suppose that this one small flower make the large white umbel at all more conspicuous to insect the central flower be say to be neuter or sterile but
71,charlesDarwin_expressionOfEmotions,charles_darwin,108056,﻿ introduction many work have be write on expression but a great number on physiognomy that be on the recognition of character through the study of the permanent form of the feature with this latter subject i be not here concern the old treatise which i have consult have be of little or no service to me the famous conference of the painter le brun publish in be the best know ancient work and contain some good remark another somewhat old essay namely the discours deliver by the well know dutch anatomist camper can hardly be consider a have make any mark advance in the subject the follow work on the contrary deserve the full consideration sir charles bell so illustrious for his discovery in physiology publish in the first edition and in the third edition of his anatomy and philosophy of expression he may with justice be say not only to have lay the foundation of the subject a a branch of science but to have build up a noble structure his work be in every way deeply interest it include graphic description of the various emotion and be admirably illustrate it be generally admit that his service consist chiefly in have show the intimate relation which exist between the movement of expression and those of respiration one of the most important point small a it may at first appear be that the muscle round the eye be involuntarily contract during violent expiratory effort in order to protect these delicate organ from the pressure of the blood this fact which have be fully investigate for me with the greatest kindness by professor donders of utrecht throw a we shall hereafter see a flood of light on several of the most important expression of the human countenance the merit of sir c bell s work have be undervalue or quite ignore by several foreign writer but have be fully admit by some for instance by m lemoine who with great justice say le livre de ch bell devrait etre medite par quiconque essaye de faire parler le visage de l homme par le philosophes aussi bien que par le artiste car sou une apparence plus legere et sou le pretexte de l esthetique c est un de plus beau monument de la science de rapport du physique et du moral from reason which will presently be assign sir c bell do not attempt to follow out his view a far a they might have be carry he do not try to explain why different muscle be bring into action under different emotion why for instance the inner end of the eyebrow be raise and the corner of the mouth depress by a person suffer from grief or anxiety in m moreau edit an edition of lavater on physiognomy in which he incorporate several of his own essay contain excellent description of the movement of the facial muscle together with many valuable remark he throw however very little light on the philosophy of the subject for instance m moreau in speak of the act of frown that be of the contraction of the muscle call by french writer the soucilier corrigator supercilii remark with truth cette action de sourciliers est un de symptomes le plus tranche de l expression de affection penibles ou concentre he then add that these muscle from their attachment and position be fit a resserrer a concentrer le principaux trait de la face comme il convient dans tout ce passion vraiment oppressives ou profondes dans ce affection dont le sentiment semble porter l organisation a revenir sur elle meme a se contracter et a s amoindrir comme pour offrir moins de prise et de surface a de impression redoutables ou importune he who think that remark of this kind throw any light on the mean or origin of the different expression take a very different view of the subject to what i do the early edition of this work refer to in the preface to the edition of in ten volume a contain the observation of m moreau be say to have be publish in and i have no doubt that this be correct because the notice sur lavater at the commencement of volume i be date april in some bibliographical work however the date of be give but it seem impossible that can be correct dr duchenne remark mecanisme de la physionomie humaine vo edit p and archive general de medecine jan et fev that m moreau a compose pour son ouvrage un article important c in the year and i find in volume i of the edition of passage bear the date of december and another january besides that of april above refer to in consequence of some of these passage have thus be compose in dr duchenne assign to m moreau the priority over sir c bell whose work a we have see be publish in this be a very unusual manner of determine the priority of scientific work but such question be of extremely little importance in comparison with their relative merit the passage above quote from m moreau and from le brun be take in this and all other case from the edition of of lavater tom iv p and tom ix p in the above passage there be but a slight if any advance in the philosophy of the subject beyond that reach by the painter le brun who in in describe the expression of fright say le sourcil qui est abaisse d un cote et eleve de l autre fait voir que la partie elevee semble le vouloir joindre au cerveau pour le garantir du mal que l ame apercoit et le cote qui est abaisse et qui parait enfle nous fait trouver dans cet etat par le esprit qui viennent du cerveau en abondance comme polir couvrir l aine et la defendre du mal qu elle craint la bouche fort ouverte fait voir le saisissement du coeur par le sing qui se retire vers lui ce qui l oblige voulant respirer a faire un effort qui est cause que la bouche s ouvre extremement et qui lorsqu il passe par le organes de la voix forme un son qui n est point articule que si le muscle et le vein paraissent enfles ce n est que par le esprit que le cerveau envoie en ce party la i have think the forego sentence worth quote a specimen of the surprise nonsense which have be write on the subject the physiology or mechanism of blush by dr burgess appear in and to this work i shall frequently refer in my thirteenth chapter in dr duchenne publish two edition in folio and octavo of his mecanisme de la physionomie humaine in which he analysis by mean of electricity and illustrate by magnificent photograph the movement of the facial muscle he have generously permit me to copy a many of his photograph a i desire his work have be speak lightly of or quite pass over by some of his countryman it be possible that dr duchenne may have exaggerate the importance of the contraction of single muscle in give expression for owe to the intimate manner in which the muscle be connect a may be see in henle s anatomical draw the best i believe ever publish it be difficult to believe in their separate action nevertheless it be manifest that dr duchenne clearly apprehend this and other source of error and a it be know that he be eminently successful in elucidate the physiology of the muscle of the hand by the aid of electricity it be probable that he be generally in the right about the muscle of the face in my opinion dr duchenne have greatly advance the subject by his treatment of it no one have more carefully study the contraction of each separate muscle and the consequent furrow produce on the skin he have also and this be a very important service show which muscle be least under the separate control of the will he enter very little into theoretical consideration and seldom attempt to explain why certain muscle and not others contract under the influence of certain emotion a distinguish french anatomist pierre gratiolet give a course of lecture on expression at the sorbonne and his note be publish after his death under the title of de la physionomie et de mouvements d expression this be a very interest work full of valuable observation his theory be rather complex and a far a it can be give in a single sentence p be a follow il resulte de tous le faits que j ai rappel que le sen l imagination et la pensee ellememe si elevee si abstraite qu on la suppose ne peuvent s exercer sans eveiller un sentiment correlatif et que ce sentiment se traduit directement sympathiquement symboliquement ou metaphoriquement dans tout le sphere de organ exterieurs qui la racontent tous suivant leur mode d action propre comme si chacun d eux avait ete directement affecte gratiolet appear to overlook inherit habit and even to some extent habit in the individual and therefore he fail a it seem to me to give the right explanation or any explanation at all of many gesture and expression a an illustration of what he call symbolic movement i will quote his remark p take from m chevreul on a man play at billiards si une bille devie legerement de la direction que le joueur pretend zlui imprimer ne l avez vous pa vu cent fois la pousser du regard de la tete et meme de epaules comme si ce mouvements purement symboliques pouvaient rectifier son trajet de mouvements non moins significatifs se produisent quand la bille manque d une impulsion suffisante et cliez le joueurs novice il sont quelquefois accuse au point d eveiller le sourire sur le levres de spectateurs such movement a it appeirs to me may be attribute simply to habit a often a a man have wish to move an object to one side he have always push it to that side when forward he have push it forward and if he have wish to arrest it he have pull backwards therefore when a man see his ball travel in a wrong direction and he intensely wish it to go in another direction he can not avoid from long habit unconsciously perform movement which in other case he have find effectual a an instance of sympathetic movement gratiolet give p the follow case un jeune chien a oreilles droites auquel son maitre presente de loin quelque viande appetissante fixe avec ardeur s yeux sur cet objet dont il suit tous le mouvements et pendant que le yeux regardent le deux oreilles se portent en avant comme si cet objet pouvait etre entendu here instead of speak of sympathy between the ear and eye it appear to me more simple to believe that a dog during many generation have whilst intently look at any object prick their ear in order to perceive any sound and conversely have look intently in the direction of a sound to which they may have listen the movement of these organ have become firmly associate together through long continue habit dr piderit publish in an essay on expression which i have not see but in which a he state he forestall gratiolet in many of his view in he publish his wissenschaftliches system der mimik und physiognomik it be hardly possible to give in a few sentence a fair notion of his view perhaps the two follow sentence will tell a much a can be briefly tell the muscular movement of expression be in part relate to imaginary object and in part to imaginary sensorial impression in this proposition lie the key to the comprehension of all expressive muscular movement s again expressive movement manifest themselves chiefly in the numerous and mobile muscle of the face partly because the nerve by which they be set into motion originate in the most immediate vicinity of the mind organ but partly also because these muscle serve to support the organ of sense s if dr piderit have study sir c bell s work he would probably not have say s that violent laughter cause a frown from partake of the nature of pain or that with infant s the tear irritate the eye and thus excite the contraction of the surround in muscle many good remark be scatter throughout this volume to which i shall hereafter refer short discussion on expression may be find in various work which need not here be particularise mr bain however in two of his work have treat the subject at some length he say i look upon the expression so call a part and parcel of the feel i believe it to be a general law of the mind that along with the fact of inward feel or consciousness there be a diffusive action or excitement over the bodily member in another place he add a very considerable number of the fact may be bring under the follow principle namely that state of pleasure be connect with an increase and state of pain with an abatement of some or all of the vital function but the above law of the diffusive action of feel seem too general to throw much light on special expression mr herbert spencer in treat of the feel in his principle of psychology make the follow remark fear when strong express itself in cry in effort to hide or escape in palpitation and trembling and these be just the manifestation that would accompany an actual experience of the evil fear the destructive passion be show in a general tension of the muscular system in gnash of the teeth and protrusion of the claw in dilate eye and nostril in growl and these be weak form of the action that accompany the kill of prey here we have a i believe the true theory of a large number of expression but the chief interest and difficulty of the subject lie in follow out the wonderfully complex result i infer that some one but who he be i have not be able to ascertain formerly advance a nearly similar view for sir c bell say it have be maintain that what be call the external sign of passion be only the concomitant of those voluntary movement which the structure render necessary mr spencer have also publish a valuable essay on the physiology of laughter in which he insist on the general law that feel pass a certain pitch habitually vent itself in bodily action and that an overflow of nerve force undirected by any motive will manifestly take first the most habitual rout and if these do not suffice will next overflow into the less habitual one this law i believe to be of the high importance in throw light on our subject all the author who have write on expression with the exception of mr spencer the great expounder of the principle of evolution appear to have be firmly convince that specie man of course include come into existence in their present condition sir c bell be thus convince maintain that many of our facial muscle be purely instrumental in expression or be a special provision for this sole object but the simple fact that the anthropoid ape possess the same facial muscle a we do render it very improbable that these muscle in our case serve exclusively for expression for no one i presume would be incline to admit that monkey have be endow with special muscle solely for exhibit their hideous grimace distinct us independently of expression can indeed be assign with much probability for almost all the facial muscle sir c bell evidently wish to draw a broad a distinction a possible between man and the lower animal and he consequently assert that with the lower creature there be no expression but what may be refer more or less plainly to their act of volition or necessary instinct he far maintain that their face seem chiefly capable of express rage and fear but man himself can not express love and humility by external sign so plainly a do a dog when with droop ear hang lip flexuous body and wag tail he meet his beloved master nor can these movement in the dog be explain by act of volition or necessary instinct any more than the beam eye and smile cheek of a man when he meet an old friend if sir c bell have be question about the expression of affection in the dog he would no doubt have answer that this animal have be create with special instinct adapt him for association with man and that all far enquiry on the subject be superfluous although gratiolet emphatically deny that any muscle have be develop solely for the sake of expression he seem never to have reflect on the principle of evolution he apparently look at each specie a a separate creation so it be with the other writer on expression for instance dr duchenne after speak of the movement of the limb refer to those which give expression to the face and remark le createur n a donc pa eu a se preoccuper ici de besoins de la mecanique il a pu selon sa sagesse ou que l on me pardonne cette maniere de parler par une divine fantaisie mettre en action tel ou tel muscle un seul ou plusieurs muscle a la fois lorsqu il a voulu que le sign caracteristiques de passion meme le plus fugaces lussent ecrits passagerement sur la face de l homme ce langage de la physionomie une fois cree il lui a suffi pour le rendre universel et immuable de donner a tout etre humain la faculte instinctive d exprimer toujours s sendments par la contraction de meme muscle many writer consider the whole subject of expression a inexplicable thus the illustrious physiologist

72,charlesDarwin_coralReefs,charles_darwin,83615,﻿ introduction the object of this volume be to describe from my own observation and the work of others the principal kind of coral reef more especially those occur in the open ocean and to explain the origin of their peculiar form i do not here treat of the polypifers which construct these vast work except so far a relate to their distribution and to the condition favourable to their vigorous growth without any distinct intention to classify coral reef most voyager have speak of them under the follow head lagoon island or atoll barrier or encircle reef and fringe or shore reef the lagoon island have receive much the most attention and it be not surprise for every one must be strike with astonishment when he first behold one of these vast ring of coral rock often many league in diameter here and there surmount by a low verdant island with dazzle white shore bath on the outside by the foam breaker of the ocean and on the inside surround a calm expanse of water which from reflection be of a bright but pale green colour the naturalist will feel this astonishment more deeply after have examine the soft and almost gelatinous body of these apparently insignificant creature and when he know that the solid reef increase only on the out edge which day and night be lash by the breaker of an ocean never at rest well do francois pyrard de laval in the year exclaim c est une merueille de voir chacun de ce atollons enuironne d un grand banc de pierre tout autour n y ayant point d artifice humain the accompany sketch of whitsunday island in the south pacific take from captain beechey s admirable voyage although excellent of it kind give but a faint idea of the singular aspect of one of these lagoon island plate untitled woodcut whitsunday atoll whitsunday island be of small size and the whole circle have be convert into land which be a comparatively rare circumstance a the reef of a lagoon island generally support many separate small island the word island apply to the whole be often the cause of confusion hence i have invariably use in this volume the term atoll which be the name give to these circular group of coral islet by their inhabitant in the indian ocean and be synonymous with lagoon island plate untitled woodcut reef at bolabola island barrier reef when encircle small island have be comparatively little notice by voyager but they well deserve attention in their structure they be little less marvellous than atoll and they give a singular and most picturesque character to the scenery of the island they surround in the accompany sketch take from the voyage of the coquille the reef be see from within from one of the high peak of the island of bolabola i have take the liberty of simplify the foreground and leave out a mountainous island in the far distance here a in whitsunday island the whole of that part of the reef which be visible be convert into land this be a circumstance of rare occurrence more usually a snow white line of great breaker with here and there an islet crown by cocoa nut tree separate the smooth water of the lagoon like channel from the wave of the open sea the barrier reef of australia and of new caledonia owe to their enormous dimension have excite much attention in structure and form they resemble those encircle many of the small island in the pacific ocean with respect to fringe or shore reef there be little in their structure which need explanation and their name express their comparatively small extension they differ from barrier reef in not lie so far from the shore and in not have within a broad channel of deep water reef also occur around submerge bank of sediment and of wear down rock and others be scatter quite irregularly where the sea be very shallow these in most respect be allied to those of the fringe class but they be of comparatively little interest i have give a separate chapter to each of the above class and have describe some one reef or island on which i possess most information a typical and have afterwards compare it with others of a like kind although this classification be useful from be obvious and from include most of the coral reef exist in the open sea it admit of a more fundamental division into barrier and atoll form reef on the one hand where there be a great apparent difficulty with respect to the foundation on which they must first have grow and into fringe reef on the other where owe to the nature of the slope of the adjoin land there be no such difficulty the two blue tint and the red colour replace by number in this edition on the map plate iii represent this main division a explain in the begin of the last chapter in the appendix every exist coral reef except some on the coast of brazil not include in the map be briefly describe in geographical order a far a i possess information and any particular spot may be find by consult the index several theory have be advance to explain the origin of atoll or lagoon island but scarcely one to account for barrier reef from the limit depth at which reef build polypifers can flourish take into consideration with certain other circumstance we be compel to conclude a it will be see that both in atoll and barrier reef the foundation on which the coral be primarily attach have subside and that during this downward movement the reef have grow upwards this conclusion it will be far see explain most satisfactorily the outline and general form of atoll and barrier reef and likewise certain peculiarity in their structure the distribution also of the different kind of coral reef and their position with relation to the area of recent elevation and to the point subject to volcanic eruption fully accord with this theory of their origin a brief account of my view on coral formation now publish in my journal of research be read may st before the geological society and an abstract have appear in the proceed description of the plate plate

or more high island form an encircle barrier reef have a nearly uniform structure the reef in some of the original survey be represent merely by a single line with cross so that their breadth be not

the officer of h m s beagle be give in plate i figure the greatest width of this atoll be nine mile and a half it structure be in most respect characteristic of the class to which it belong with the exception of the shallowness of the lagoon the accompany woodcut represent a vertical section suppose to be draw at low water from the out coast across one of the low islet one be take of average dimension to within the lagoon the section be true to the scale in a horizontal line but it could not be make so in a vertical one a the average greatest height of the land be only between six and twelve foot above high water mark i will describe the section commence with the out margin i must first observe that the reef build polypifers not be tidal animal require to be constantly submerge or wash by the breaker i be assure by mr liesk a very intelligent resident on these island a well a by some chief at tahiti otaheite that an exposure to the ray of the sun for a very short time invariably cause their destruction hence it be possible only under the most favourable circumstance afford by an unusually low tide and smooth water to reach the out margin where the coral be alive i succeed only twice in gain this part and find it almost entirely compose of a live porites which form great irregularly round mass like those of an astraea but large from four to eight foot broad and little less in thickness these mound be separate from each other by narrow crooked channel about six foot deep most of which intersect the line of reef at right angle on the furthest mound which i be able to reach by the aid of a leap pole and over which the sea break with some violence although the day be quite calm and the tide low the polypifers in the uppermost cell be all dead but between three and four inch lower down on it side they be live and form a project border round the upper and dead surface the coral be thus check in it upward growth extend laterally and hence most of the mass especially those a little far inwards have broad flat dead summit on the other hand i could see during the recoil of the breaker that a few yard far seaward the whole convex surface of the porites be alive so that the point where we be stand be almost on the exact upward and shoreward limit of existence of those coral which form the out margin of the reef we shall presently see that there be other organic production fit to bear a somewhat long exposure to the air and sun next but much inferior in importance to the porites be the millepora complanata this millepora palmipora of blainville a well a the m alcicornis possess the singular property of sting the skin where it be delicate a on the face and arm it grow in thick vertical plate intersect each other at various angle and form an exceedingly strong honeycomb mass which generally affect a circular form the marginal plate alone be alive between these plate and in the protect crevice on the reef a multitude of branch zoophyte and other production flourish but the porites and millepora alone seem able to resist the fury of the breaker on it upper and out edge at the depth of a few fathom other kind of stony coral live mr liesk who be intimately acquaint with every part of this reef and likewise with that of north keel atoll assure me that these coral invariably compose the out margin the lagoon be inhabit by quite a distinct set of coral generally brittle and thinly branch but a porites apparently of the same specie with that on the outside be find there although it do not seem to thrive and certainly do not attain the thousandth part in bulk of the mass oppose to the breaker the woodcut show the form of the bottom off the reef the water deepen for a space between one and two hundred yard wide very gradually to twenty five fathom a in section beyond which the side plunge into the unfathomable ocean at an angle of deg the sound from which this section be lay down be take with great care by captain fitzroy himself he use a bell shape lead have a diameter of four inch and the arm each time be cut off and bring on board for me to examine the arm be a preparation of tallow place in the concavity at the bottom of the lead sand and even small fragment of rock will adhere to it and if the bottom be of rock it bring up an exact impression of it surface to the depth of ten or twelve

73,charlesDarwin_volcanicIslands,charles_darwin,57533,﻿critical introduction the preparation of the series of work publish under the general title geology of the voyage of the beagle occupy a great part of darwin s time during the ten year that follow his return to england the second volume of the series entitle geological observation on volcanic island with brief notice on the geology of australia and the cape of good hope make it appearance in the material for this volume be collect in part during the outward voyage when the beagle call at st jago in the cape de verde island and st paul s rock and at fernando noronha but mainly during the homeward cruise then it be that the galapagos island be survey the low archipelago pass through and tahiti visit after make call at the bay of island in new zealand and also at sydney hobart town and king george s sound in australia the beagle sail across the indian ocean to the little group of the keel or coco island which darwin have render famous by his observation and thence to mauritius call at the cape of good hope on her way the ship then proceed successively to st helena and ascension and revisit the cape de verde island before finally reach england although darwin be thus able to gratify his curiosity by visit to a great number of very interest volcanic district the voyage open for him with a bitter disappointment he have be read humboldt s personal narrative during his last year s residence in cambridge and have copy out from it long passage about teneriffe he be actually make inquiry a to the best mean of visit that island when the offer be make to him to accompany captain fitzroy in the beagle his friend henslow too on part with him have give him the advice to procure and read the recently publish first volume of the principle of geology though he warn him against accept the view advocate by it author during the time the beagle be beat backwards and forward when the voyage commence darwin although hardly ever able to leave his berth be employ all the opportunity which the terrible sea sickness leave him in study humboldt and lyell we may therefore form an idea of his feel when on the ship reach santa cruz and the peak of teneriffe make it appearance among the cloud they be suddenly inform that an outbreak of cholera would prevent any land ample compensation for this disappointment be find however when the ship reach porta praya in st jago the large of the cape de verde island here he spend three most delightful week and really commence his work a a geologist and naturalist write to his father he say geologising in a volcanic country be most delightful besides the interest attach to itself it lead you into most beautiful and retire spot nobody but a person fond of natural history can imagine the pleasure of stroll under cocoa nut in a thicket of banana and coffee plant and an endless number of wild flower and this island that have give me so much instruction and delight be reckon the most uninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage it certainly be generally very barren but the valley be more exquisitely beautiful from the very contrast it be utterly useless to say anything about the scenery it would be a profitable to explain to a blind man colour a to a person who have not be out of europe the total dissimilarity of a tropical view whenever i enjoy anything i always look forward to write it down either in my log book which increase in bulk or in a letter so you must excuse rapture and those rapture badly express i find my collection be increase wonderfully and from rio i think i shall be oblige to send a cargo home the indelible impression make on darwin s mind by this first visit to a volcanic island be bear witness to by a remarkable passage in the autobiography write by him in the geology of st jago be very strike yet simple a stream of lava formerly flow over the bed of the sea form of triturated recent shell and coral which it have bake into a hard white rock since then the whole island have be upheave but the line of white rock reveal to me a new and important fact namely that there have be afterwards subsidence round the crater which have since be in action and have pour forth lava it then first dawn on me that i might perhaps write a book on the geology of the various country visit and this make me thrill with delight that be a memorable hour to me and how distinctly i can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which i rest with the sun glare hot a few strange desert plant grow near and with live coral in the tidal pool at my foot only five year before when listen to poor professor jameson s lecture on the effete wernerianism which at that time do duty for geological teaching darwin have find them incredibly dull and he declare that the sole effect they produce on me be a determination never so long a i live to read a book on geology or in any way to study the science what a contrast we find in the expression which he make use of in refer to geological science in his letter write home from the beagle after allude to the delight of collect and study marine animal he exclaim but geology carry the day write to henslow he say i be quite charm with geology but like the wise animal between two bundle of hay i do not know which to like best the old crystalline group of rock or the soft and more fossiliferous bed and just a the long voyage be about to come to a close he again write i find in geology a never fail interest a it have be remark it create the same grand idea respect this world which astronomy do for the universe in this passage darwin doubtless refer to a remark of sir john herschel s in his admirable preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy a book which exercise a most remarkable and beneficial influence on the mind of the young naturalist if there can not be any doubt a to the strong predilection in darwin s mind for geological study both during and after the memorable voyage there be equally little difficulty in perceive the school of geological think which in spite of the warn of sedgwick and henslow have obtain complete ascendancy over his mind he write in the very first place which i examine namely st jago in the cape de verde island show me clearly the wonderful superiority of lyell s manner of treat geology compare with that of any other author whose work i have with me or ever afterwards read and again the science of geology be enormously indebted to lyell more so a i believe than to any other man who ever live i be proud to remember that the first place namely st jago in the cape de verde archipelago in which i geologised convince me of the infinite superiority of lyell s view over those advocate in any other work know to me the passage i have cite will serve to show the spirit in which darwin enter upon his geological study and the perusal of the follow page will furnish abundant proof of the enthusiasm acumen and caution with which his research be pursue large collection of rock and mineral be make by darwin during his research and send home to cambridge to be keep under the care of his faithful friend henslow after visit his relation and friend darwin s first care on his return to england be to unpack and examine these collection he accordingly at the end of take lodging for three month in fitzwilliam street cambridge so a to be near henslow and in study and determine his geological specimen receive much valuable aid from the eminent crystallographer and mineralogist professor william hallow miller the actual write of the volume upon volcanic island be not commence till when darwin have settle in the spot which become his home for the rest of his life the famous house at down in kent write to his friend mr fox on march th he say i be very slowly progress with a volume or rather pamphlet on the volcanic island which we visit i manage only a couple of hour per day and that not very regularly it be uphill work write book which cost money in publish and which be not read even by geologist the work occupy darwin during the whole of the year and be issue in the spring of the follow year the actual time engage in prepare it be record in his diary a from the summer of to january but the author do not appear to have be by any mean satisfy with the result when the book be finish he write to lyell you have please me much by say that you intend look through my volcanic island it cost me eighteen month and i have hear of very few who have read it now i shall feel whatever little and little it be there be confirmatory of old work or new will work it effect and not be lose to sir joseph hooker he write i have just finish a little volume on the volcanic island which we visit i do not know how far you care for dry simple geology but i hope you will let me send you a copy every geologist know how full of interest and suggestiveness be this book of darwin s on volcanic island probably the scant satisfaction which it author seem to find in it may be trace to the effect of a contrast which he felt between the memory of glow delight he have experience when hammer in hand he roam over new and interest scene and the slow laborious and less congenial task of re write and arrange his note in book form in in write an account of the ancient volcano of the hebrides i have frequent occasion to quote mr darwin s observation on the atlantic volcano in illustration of the phenomenon exhibit by the relic of still old volcano in our own island darwin in write to his old friend sir charles lyell upon the subject say i be not a little please to see my volcanic book quote for i think it be completely dead and forget two year late the original publisher of this book and of that on south america propose to re issue them darwin at first hesitate for he seem to think there could be little of abide interest in them he consult me upon the subject in one of the conversation which i use to have with him at that time and i strongly urge upon him the reprint of the work i be much gratify when he give way upon the point and consent to their appear just a originally issue in his preface he say owe to the great progress which geology have make in recent time my view on some few point may be somewhat antiquate but i have think it best to leave them a they originally appear it may be interest to indicate a briefly a possible the chief geological problem upon which the publication of darwin s volcanic island throw new and important light the merit of the work consist in supply interest observation which in some case have prove of crucial value in explode prevalent fallacy in call attention to phenomenon and consideration that have be quite overlook by geologist but have since exercise an important influence in moulding geological speculation and lastly in show the importance which attach to small and seemingly insignificant cause some of which afford a key to the explanation of very curious geological problem visit a he do the district in which von buch and others have find what they think to be evidence of the truth of elevation crater darwin be able to show that the fact be capable of a totally different interpretation the view originally put forward by the old german geologist and traveller and almost universally accept by his countryman have meet with much support from elie de beaumont and dufrenoy the leader of geological think in france they be however stoutly oppose by scrope and lyell in this country and by constant prevost and virlet on the other side of the channel darwin in the work before u show how little grind there be for the assumption that the great ring crater of the atlantic island have originate in gigantic blister of the earth s surface which opening at the top have give origin to the crater admit the influence of the injection of lava into the structure of the volcanic cone in increase their bulk and elevation he show that in the main the volcano be build up by repeat ejection cause an accumulation of material around the vent while however agree on the whole with scrope and lyell a to the explosive origin of ordinary volcanic crater darwin clearly saw that in some case great crater might be form or enlarge by the subsidence of the floor after eruption the importance of this agency to which too little attention have be direct by geologist have recently be show by professor dana in his admirable work on kilauea and the other great volcano of the hawaiian archipelago the effect of subsidence at a volcanic centre in produce a downward dip of the stratum around it be first point out by darwin a the result of his early work in the cape de verde island strike illustration of the same principle have since be point out by m robert and others in iceland by mr heaphy in new zealand and by myself in the western isle of scotland darwin again and again call attention to the evidence that volcanic vent exhibit relation to one another which can only be explain by assume the existence of line of fissure in the earth s crust along which the lava have make their way to the surface but he at the same time clearly saw that there be no evidence of the occurrence of great deluge of lava along such fissure he show how the most remarkable plateau compose of successive lava sheet might be build up by repeat and moderate ejection from numerous isolate vent and he expressly insist upon the rapidity with which the cinder cone around the orifice of ejection and the evidence of successive outflow of lava would be obliterate by denudation one of the most strike part of the book be that in which he deal with the effect of denudation in produce basal wreck or wear down stump of volcano he be enable to examine a series of case in which could be trace every gradation from perfect volcanic cone down to the solidify plug which have consolidate in the vent from which ejection have take place darwin s observation on these point have be of the greatest value and assistance to all who have essay to study the effect of volcanic action during early period of the earth s history like lyell he be firmly persuade of the continuity of geological history and ever delight in find indication in the present order of nature that the phenomenon of the past could be account for by mean of cause which be still in operation lyell s last work in the field be carry on about his home in forfarshire and only a few month before his death he write to darwin all the work which i have do have confirm me in the belief that the only difference between palaeozoic and recent volcanic rock be no more than we must allow for by the enormous time to which the product of the old volcano have be subject to chemical change darwin be greatly impress a the result of his study of volcanic phenomenon follow by an examination of the great granite mass of the andes with the relation between the so call plutonic rock and those of undoubtedly volcanic origin it be indeed a fortunate circumstance that after study some excellent example of recent volcanic rock he proceed to examine in south america many fine illustration of the old igneous rock mass and especially of the most highly crystalline type of the same and then on his way home have opportunity of revive the impression make upon him by the fresh and unaltered volcanic rock some of the general consideration suggest by these observation be discuss in a paper read by him before the geological society on march th under the title on the connection of certain volcanic phenomenon and on the formation of mountain chain and the effect of continental elevation the exact bear of these two class of fact upon one another be more fully discuss in his book on south american geology the proof of recent elevation around many of the volcanic island lead darwin to conclude that volcanic area be a a rule region in which upward movement be take place and he be naturally lead to contrast them with the area in which a he show the occurrence of atoll encircle reef and barrier reef afford indication of subsidence in this way he be able to map out the oceanic area in different zone along which opposite kind of movement be take place his conclusion on this subject be full of novelty and suggestiveness very clearly do darwin recognise the importance of the fact that most of the oceanic island appear to be of
74,charlesDarwin_geologicalObservationsAmerica,charles_darwin,135135,﻿critical introduction of the remarkable trilogy constitute by darwin s write which deal with the geology of the beagle the member which have perhaps attract least attention up to the present time be that which treat of the geology of south america the actual write of this book appear to have occupy darwin a short period than either of the other volume of the series his diary record that the work be accomplish within ten month namely between july and april but the book be not actually issue till late in the year follow the preface bear the date september altogether a darwin inform u in his autobiography the geological book consume four and a half year steady work most of the remainder of the ten year that elapse between the return of the beagle and the completion of his geological book be it be sad to relate lose through illness concern the geological observation on south america darwin write to his friend lyell a follow my volume will be about page dreadfully dull yet much condense i think whenever you have time to look through it you will think the collection of fact on the elevation of the land and on the formation of terrace pretty good much condense be the verdict that everyone must endorse on rise from the perusal of this remarkable book but by no mean dull the three and a half year from april to september be spend by darwin in south america and be devote to continuous scientific work the problem he deal with be either purely geological or those which constitute the borderland between the geological and biological science it be impossible to read the journal which he keep during this time without be impress by the conviction that it contain all the germ of think which afterwards develop into the origin of specie but it be equally evident that after his return to england biological speculation gradually begin to exercise a more exclusive sway over darwin s mind and tend to dispossess geology which during the actual period of the voyage certainly engross most of his time and attention the wonderful series of observation make during those three and a half year in south america could scarcely be do justice to in the page devote to their exposition that he execute the work of prepare the book on south america in somewhat the manner of a task be show by many reference in his letter write to sir joseph hooker in he say i hope this next summer to finish my south american geology then to get out a little zoology and hurrah for my specie work it would seem that the feel of disappointment which darwin so often experience in compare a book when complete with the observation and speculation which have inspire it be more keenly felt in the case of his volume on south america than any other to one friend he write i have of late be slave extra hard to the great discomfiture of wretched digestive organ at south america and thank all the fate i have do three fourth of it write plain english grow with me more and more difficult and never attainable a for your pretend that you will read anything so dull a my pure geological description lay not such a flatter unction on my soul for it be incredible to another friend he write you do not know what you threaten when you propose to read it it be purely geological i say to my brother you will of course read it and his answer be upon my life i would sooner even buy it in spite of these disparage remark however we be strongly incline to believe that this book despise by it author and neglect by his contemporary will in the end be admit to be one of darwin s chief title to fame it be perhaps an unfortunate circumstance that the great success which he attain in biology by the publication of the origin of specie have to some extent overshadow the fact that darwin s claim a a geologist be of the very high order it be not too much to say that have darwin not be a geologist the origin of specie could never have be write by him but apart from those geological question which have an important bear on biological think and speculation such a the proof of imperfection in the geological record the relation of the late tertiary fauna to the recent one in the same area and the apparent intermingle of type belong to distant geological epoch when we study the palaeontology of remote district there be other purely geological problem upon which the contribution make by darwin be of the very high value i believe that the verdict of the historian of science will be that if darwin have not take a foremost place among the biologist of this century his position a a geologist would have be an almost equally command one but in the case of darwin s principal geological work that relate to the origin of the crystalline schist geologist be not at the time prepare to receive his revolutionary teaching the influence of powerful authority be long exercise indeed to stifle his teaching and only now when this unfortunate opposition have disappear be the true nature and importance of darwin s purely geological work begin to be recognise the two first chapter of the geological observation on south america deal with the proof which exist of great but frequently interrupt movement of elevation during very recent geological time in connection with this subject darwin s particular attention be direct to the relation between the great earthquake of south america of some of which he have impressive experience and the permanent change of elevation which be take place he be much strike by the rapidity with which the evidence of such great earth movement be frequently obliterate and especially with the remarkable way in which the action of rain water percolate through deposit on the earth s surface remove all trace of shell and other calcareous organism it be these consideration which be the parent of the generalisation that a palaeontological record can only be preserve during those period in which long continue slow subsidence be go on this in turn lead to the still wide and more suggestive conclusion that the geological record a a whole be and never can be more than a series of more or less isolate fragment the recognition of this important fact constitute the keystone to any theory of evolution which seek to find a basis in the actual study of the type of life that have formerly inhabit our globe in his third chapter darwin give a number of interest fact collect during his visit to the plain and valley of chili which bear on the question of the origin of saliferous deposit the accumulation of salt gypsum and nitrate of soda this be a problem that have excite much discussion among geologist and which in spite of many valuable observation still remain to a great extent very obscure among the important consideration insist upon by darwin be that relate to the absence of marine shell in bed associate with such deposit he justly argue that if the stratum be form in shallow water and then expose by upheaval to subaerial action all shell and other calcareous organism would be remove by solution follow lyell s method darwin proceed from the study of deposit now be accumulate on the earth s surface to those which have be form during the more recent period of the geological history his account of the great pampean formation with it wonderful mammalian remain mastodon toxodon scelidotherium macrauchenia megatherium megalonyx mylodon and glyptodon this full of interest his discovery of the remain of a true equus afford a remarkable confirmation of the fact already make out in north america that specie of horse have exist and become extinct in the new world before their introduction by the spaniard in the sixteenth century fully perceive the importance of the microscope in study the nature and origin of such deposit a those of the pampas darwin submit many of his specimen both to dr carpenter in this country and to professor ehrenberg in berlin many very important note on the microscopic organism contain in the formation will be find scatter through the chapter darwin s study of the old tertiary formation with their abundant shell and their relic of vegetable life bury under great sheet of basalt lead him to consider carefully the question of climate during these early period in opposition to prevalent view on this subject darwin point out that his observation be oppose to the conclusion that a high temperature prevail universally over the globe during early geological period he argue that the cause which give to the old tertiary production of the quite temperate zone of europe a tropical character be of a local character and do not affect the whole globe in this a in many similar instance we see the beneficial influence of extensive travel in free darwin s mind from prevail prejudice it be this widen of experience which render him so especially qualify to deal with the great problem of the origin of specie and in do so to emancipate himself from idea which be receive with unquestioning faith by geologist whose study have be circumscribe within the limit of western europe in the cordilleras of northern and central chili darwin when study still old formation clearly recognise that they contain an admixture of the form of life which in europe be distinctive of the cretaceous and jurassic period respectively he be thus lead to conclude that the classification of geological period which fairly well express the fact that have be discover in the area where the science be first study be no long capable of be apply when we come to the study of widely distant region this important conclusion lead up to the far generalisation that each great geological period have exhibit a geographical distribution of the form of animal and vegetable life comparable to that which prevail in the exist fauna and flora to those who be familiar with the extent to which the doctrine of universal formation have affect geological think and speculation both long before and since the time that darwin write the importance of this new standpoint to which he be able to attain will be sufficiently apparent like the idea of the extreme imperfection of the geological record the doctrine of local geological formation be find permeate and moulding all the palaeontological reason of his great work in one of darwin s letter write while he be in south america there be a passage we have already quote in which he express his inability to decide between the rival claim upon his attention of the old crystalline group of rock and the soft fossiliferous bed respectively the sixth chapter of the work before u entitle plutonic and metamorphic rock cleavage and foliation contain a brief summary of a series of observation and reason upon these crystalline rock which be we believe calculate to effect a revolution in geological science and though their value and importance have long be overlook be likely to entitle darwin in the future to a position among geologist scarcely if at all inferior to that which he already occupy among biologist darwin s study of the great rock mass of the andes convince him of the close relation between the granitic or plutonic rock and those which be undoubtedly pour forth a lava upon his return he set to work with the aid of professor miller to make a careful study of the mineral compose the granite and those which occur in the lava and he be able to show that in all essential respect they be identical he be far able to prove that there be a complete gradation between the highly crystalline or granitic rock mass and those contain more or less glassy matter between their crystal which constitute ordinary lava the importance of this conclusion will be realise when we remember that it be then the common creed of geologist and still continue to be so on the continent that all highly crystalline rock be of great geological antiquity and that the igneous ejection which have take place since the begin of the tertiary period differ essentially in their composition their structure and their mode of occurrence from those which have make their appearance at early period of the world s history very completely have the conclusion of darwin upon these subject be justify by recent research in england the unite state and italy example of the gradual passage of rock of truly granitic structure into ordinary lava have be describe and the reality of the transition have be demonstrate by the most careful study with the microscope recent research carry on in south america by professor stelzner have also show the existence of a class of highly crystalline rock the andengranites which combine in themselves many of the characteristic which be once think to be distinctive of the so call plutonic and volcanic rock no one familiar with recent geological literature even in germany and france where the old view concern the distinction of igneous product of different age have be most stoutly maintain can fail to recognise the fact that the principle contend for by darwin bid fair at no distant period to win universal acceptance among geologist all over the globe still more important be the conclusion at which darwin arrive with respect to the origin of the schist and gneiss which cover so large an area in south america carefully note by the aid of his compass and clinometer at every point which he visit the direction and amount of inclination of the parallel division in these rock he be lead to a very important generalisation namely that over very wide area the direction strike of the plan of cleavage in slat and of foliation in schist and gneiss remain constant though the amount of their inclination dip often vary within wide limit far than this it appear that there be always a close correspondence between the strike of the cleavage and foliation and the direction of the great ax along which elevation have take place in the district in tierra del fuego darwin find strike evidence that the cleavage intersect great mass of slate rock be quite independent of their original stratification and could often indeed be see cut across it at right angle he be also able to verify sedgwick s observation that in some slat glossy surface on the plan of cleavage arise from the development of new mineral chlorite epidote or mica and that in this way a complete graduation from slat to true schist may be trace darwin far show that in highly schistose rock the folium bend around and encircle any foreign body in the mass and that in some case they exhibit the most tortuous form and complicate pucker he clearly saw that in all case the force by which these strike phenomenon must have be produce be persistent over wide area and be connect with the great movement by which the rock have be upheave and fold that the distinct folium of quartz feldspar mica and other mineral compose the metamorphic schist could not have be separately deposit a sediment be strongly insist upon by darwin and in do so he oppose the view generally prevalent among geologist at that time he be thus drive to the conclusion that foliation like cleavage be not an original but a superinduced structure in rock mass and that it be the result of re crystallisation under the control influence of great pressure of the material of which the rock be compose in study the lava of ascension a we have already see darwin be lead to recognise the circumstance that when igneous rock be subject to great differential movement during the period of their consolidation they acquire a foliate structure closely analogous to that of the crystalline schist like his predecessor in this field of inquiry mr poulett scrope charles darwin seem to have be greatly impress by these fact and he argue from them that the rock exhibit the foliate structure must have be in a state of plasticity like that of a cool mass of lava at that time the suggestive experiment of tresca daubree and others show that solid mass under the influence of enormous pressure become actually plastic have not be publish have darwin be aware of these fact he would have see that it be not necessary to assume a state of imperfect solidity in rock mass in order to account for their have yield to pressure and tension and in do so acquire the new character which distinguish the crystalline schist the view put forward by darwin on the origin of the crystalline schist find an able advocate in mr daniel sharpe who in and publish two paper deal with the geology of the scottish highland and of the alp respectively in which he show that the principle arrive at by darwin when study the south american rock afford a complete explanation of the structure of the two district in question but on the other hand the conclusion of darwin and sharpe be meet with the strong opposition by sir roderick murchison and dr a geikie who in read a paper before the geological society on the coincidence between stratification and foliation in the crystalline rock of the scottish highland in which they insist that their observation in scotland tend to entirely disprove the conclusion of darwin that foliation in rock be a secondary structure and entirely independent of the original stratification of the rock mass now it be a most significant circumstance that no sooner do the officer of the geological survey commence the careful

brandy from the normandy coast and the letter have find it way by the same hand my dear nephew louis say the letter now that your father be dead and that you be alone in the world i be sure that you will not wish to carry on the feud which have exist between the two half of the family at the time of the trouble your father be draw towards the side of the king and i towards that of the people and it end a you know by his have to fly from the country and by my become the possessor of the estate of grosbois no doubt it be very hard that you should find yourself in a different position to your ancestor but i be sure that you would rather that the land should be hold by a bernac than by a stranger from the brother of your mother you will at least always meet with sympathy and consideration and now i have some advice for you you know that i have always be a republican but it have become evident to me that there be no use in fight against fate and that napoleon s power be far too great to be shake this be so i have try to serve him for it be well to howl when you be among wolf i have be able to do so much for him that he have become my very good friend so that i may ask him what i like in return he be now a you be probably aware with the army at boulogne within a few mile of grosbois if you will come over at once he will certainly forget the hostility of your father in consideration of the service of your uncle it be true that your name be still proscribe but my influence with the emperor will set that matter right come to me then come at once and come with confidence your uncle c bernac so much for the letter but it be the outside which have puzzle me most a seal of red wax have be affix at either end and my uncle have apparently use his thumb a a signet one could see the little ripple edge of a coarse skin imprint upon the wax and then above one of the seal there be write in english the two word don t come it be hastily scrawl and whether by a man or a woman it be impossible to say but there it star me in the face that sinister addition to an invitation don t come have it be add by this unknown uncle of mine on account of some sudden change in his plan surely that be inconceivable for why in that case should he send the invitation at all or be it place there by some one else who wish to warn me from accept this offer of hospitality the letter be in french the warn be in english could it have be add in england but the seal be unbroken and how could any one in england know what be the content of the letter and then a i sit there with the big sail hum like a shell above my head and the green water hiss beside me i think over all that i have hear of this uncle of mine my father the descendant of one of the proud and old family in france have chosen beauty and virtue rather than rank in his wife never for an hour have she give him cause to regret it but this lawyer brother of hers have a i understand offend my father by his slavish obsequiousness in day of prosperity and his venomous enmity in the day of trouble he have hound on the peasant until my family have be compel to fly from the country and have afterwards aid robespierre in his worst excess receive a a reward the castle and estate of grosbois which be our own at the fall of robespierre he have succeed in conciliate barras and through every successive change he still manage to gain a fresh tenure of the property now it appear from his letter that the new emperor of france have also take his part though why he should befriend a man with such a history and what service my republican uncle could possibly render to him be matter upon which i could form no opinion and now you will ask me no doubt why i should accept the invitation of such a man a man whom my father have always stigmatise a a usurper and a traitor it be easy to speak of it now than then but the fact be that we of the new generation felt it very irksome and difficult to carry on the bitter quarrel of the last to the old emigre the clock of time seem to have stop in the year and they remain for ever with the love and the hatred of that era fix indelibly upon their soul they have be burn into them by the fiery furnace through which they have pass but we who have grow up upon a strange soil understand that the world have move and that new issue have arise we be incline to forget these feud of the last generation france to u be no long the murderous land of the sans culotte and the guillotine basket it be rather the glorious queen of war attack by all and conquer all but still so hard press that her scatter son could hear her call to arm for ever sound in their ear it be that call more than my uncle s letter which be take me over the water of the channel for long my heart have be with my country in her struggle and yet while my father live i have never dare to say so for to him who have serve under conde and fight at quiberon it would have seem the black treason but after his death there be no reason why i should not return to the land of my birth and my desire be the strong because eugenie the same eugenie who have be thirty year my wife be of the same way of think a myself her parent be a branch of the de choiseuls and their prejudice be even strong than those of my father little do they think what be pass in the mind of their child many a time when they be mourning a french victory in the parlour we be both caper with joy in the garden there be a little window all choke round with laurel bush in the corner of the bare brick house and there we use to meet at night the dearer to each other from our difference with all who surround u i would tell her my ambition she would strengthen them by her enthusiasm and so all be ready when the time come but there be another reason besides the death of my father and the receipt of this letter from my uncle ashford be become too hot to hold me i will say this for the english that they be very generous host to the french emigrant there be not one of u who do not carry away a kindly remembrance of the land and it people but in every country there be overbear swagger folk and even in quiet sleepy ashford we be plague by them there be one young kentish squire farley be his name who have earn a reputation in the town a a bully and a roisterer he could not meet one of u without utter insult not merely against the present french government which might have be excusable in an english patriot but against france itself and all frenchman often we be force to be deaf in his presence but at last his conduct become so intolerable that i determine to teach him a lesson there be several of u in the coffee room at the green man one evening and he full of wine and malice be heap insult upon the french his eye creep round to me every moment to see how i be take it now monsieur de laval he cry put his rude hand upon my shoulder here be a toast for you to drink this be to the arm of nelson which strike down the french he stand leer at me to see if i would drink it well sir say i i will drink your toast if you will drink mine in return come on then say he so we drink now monsieur let u have your toast say he fill your glass then say i it be full now well then here s to the cannon ball which carry off that arm in an instant i have a glass of port wine run down my face and within an hour a meet have be arrange i shoot him through the shoulder and that night when i come to the little window eugenie pluck off some of the laurel leave and stick them in my hair there be no legal proceed about the duel but it make my position a little difficult in the town and it will explain with other thing why i have no hesitation in accept my unknown uncle s invitation in spite of the singular addition which i find upon the cover if he have indeed sufficient influence with the emperor to remove the proscription which be attach to our name then the only barrier which shut me off from my country would be demolish you must picture me all this time a sit upon the side of the lugger and turn my prospect and my position over in my head my reverie be interrupt by the heavy hand of the english skipper drop abruptly upon my arm now then master say he it s time you be step into the dingey i do not inherit the politics of the aristocrat but i have never lose their sense of personal dignity i gently push away his pollute hand and i remark that we be still a long way from the shore well you can do a you please say he roughly i m go no near so you can take your choice of get into the dingey or of swim for it it be in vain that i plead that he have be pay his price i do not add that that price mean that the watch which have belong to three generation of de lavals be now lie in the shop of a dover goldsmith little enough too he cry harshly down sail jim and bring her to now master you can step over the side or you can come back to dover but i don t take the vixen a cable s length near to ambleteuse beef with this gale come up from the sou west in that case i shall go say i you can lay your life on that he answer and laugh in so irritate a fashion that i half turn upon him with the intention of chastise him one be very helpless with these fellow however for a serious affair be of course out of the question while if one us a cane upon them they have a vile habit of strike with their hand which give them an advantage the marquis de chamfort tell me that when he first settle in sutton at the time of the emigration he lose a tooth when reprove an unruly peasant i make the best of a necessity therefore and shrug my shoulder i pass over the side of the lugger into the little boat my bundle be drop in after me conceive to yourself the heir of all the de lavals travel with a single bundle for his baggage and two seaman push her off pull with long slow stroke towards the low lie shore there be certainly every promise of a wild night for the dark cloud which have roll up over the set sun be now fray and rag at the edge extend a good third of the way across the heaven it have split low down near the horizon and the crimson glare of the sunset beat through the gap so that there be the appearance of fire with a monstrous reek of smoke a red dance belt of light lay across the broad slate colour ocean and in the centre of it the little black craft be wallow and tumble the two seaman keep look up at the heaven and then over their shoulder at the land and i fear every moment that they would put back before the gale burst i be fill with apprehension every time when the end of their pull turn their face skyward and it be to draw their attention away from the storm drift that i ask them what the light be which have begin to twinkle through the dusk both to the right and to the leave of u that s boulogne to the north and etaples upon the south say one of the seaman civilly boulogne etaples how the word come back to me it be to boulogne that in my boyhood we have go down for the summer bath could i not remember a a little lad trot along by my father s side a he pace the beach and wonder why every fisherman s cap fly off at our approach and a to etaples it be thence that we have flee for england when the folk come rave to the pier head a we pass and i join my thin voice to my father s a he shriek back at them for a stone have break my mother s knee and we be all frenzied with our fear and our hatred and here they be these place of my childhood twinkle to the north and south of me while there in the darkness between them and only ten mile off at the furthest lay my own castle my own land of grosbois where the men of my blood have live and die long before some of u have go across with duke william to conquer the proud island over the water how i strain my eager eye through the darkness a i think that the distant black keep of our fortalice might even now be visible yes sir say the seaman ti a fine stretch of lonesome coast and many be the cock of your hackle that i have help ashore there what do you take me for then i ask well ti no business of mine sir he answer there be some trade that have best not even be speak about you think that i be a conspirator well master since you have put a name to it lor love you sir we re use to it i give you my word that i be none an escape prisoner then no nor that either the man lean upon his oar and i could see in the gloom that his face be thrust forward and that it be wrinkle with suspicion if you re one of boney s spy he cry i a spy the tone of my voice be enough to convince him well say he i m darn if i know what you be but if you d be a spy i d ha have no hand in land you whatever the skipper might say mind you i ve no word to say against boney say the other seaman speak in a very thick rumble voice he s be a rare good friend to the poor mariner it surprise me to hear him speak so for the virulence of feel against the new french emperor in england exceed all belief and high and low be unite in their hatred of him but the sailor soon give me a clue to his politics if the poor mariner can run in his little bit of coffee and sugar and run out his silk and his brandy he have boney to thank for it say he the merchant have have their spell and now it s the turn of the poor mariner i remember then that buonaparte be personally very popular amongst the smuggler a well he might be see that he have make over into their hand all the trade of the channel the seaman continue to pull with his leave hand but he point with his right over the slate colour dance water there s boney himself say he you who live in a quiet age can not conceive the thrill which these
76,arthurDoyle_valleyOfFear,arthur_doyle,58900,﻿part the tragedy of birlstone chapter the warn i be incline to think say i i should do so sherlock holmes remark impatiently i believe that i be one of the most long suffer of mortal but i ll admit that i be annoy at the sardonic interruption really holmes say i severely you be a little try at time he be too much absorb with his own thought to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance he lean upon his hand with his untasted breakfast before him and he star at the slip of paper which he have just draw from it envelope then he take the envelope itself hold it up to the light and very carefully study both the exterior and the flap it be porlock s write say he thoughtfully i can hardly doubt that it be porlock s write though i have see it only twice before the greek e with the peculiar top flourish be distinctive but if it be porlock then it must be something of the very first importance he be speak to himself rather than to me but my vexation disappear in the interest which the word awaken who then be porlock i ask porlock watson be a nom de plume a mere identification mark but behind it lie a shifty and evasive personality in a former letter he frankly inform me that the name be not his own and defy me ever to trace him among the teem million of this great city porlock be important not for himself but for the great man with whom he be in touch picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lion anything that be insignificant in companionship with what be formidable not only formidable watson but sinister in the high degree sinister that be where he come within my purview you have hear me speak of professor moriarty the famous scientific criminal a famous among crook a my blush watson holmes murmur in a deprecate voice i be about to say a he be unknown to the public a touch a distinct touch cry holmes you be develop a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which i must learn to guard myself but in call moriarty a criminal you be utter libel in the eye of the law and there lie the glory and the wonder of it the greatest schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the control brain of the underworld a brain which might have make or mar the destiny of nation that s the man but so aloof be he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and self effacement that for those very word that you have utter he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year s pension a a solatium for his wound character be he not the celebrate author of the dynamic of an asteroid a book which ascend to such rarefy height of pure mathematics that it be say that there be no man in the scientific press capable of criticize it be this a man to traduce foul mouth doctor and slander professor such would be your respective role that s genius watson but if i be spar by less men our day will surely come may i be there to see i exclaim devoutly but you be speak of this man porlock ah yes the so call porlock be a link in the chain some little way from it great attachment porlock be not quite a sound link between ourselves he be the only flaw in that chain so far a i have be able to test it but no chain be strong than it weak link exactly my dear watson hence the extreme importance of porlock lead on by some rudimentary aspiration towards right and encourage by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten pound note send to him by devious method he have once or twice give me advance information which have be of value that high value which anticipate and prevent rather than avenge crime i can not doubt that if we have the cipher we should find that this communication be of the nature that i indicate again holmes flatten out the paper upon his unused plate i rise and lean over him star down at the curious inscription which run a follow c douglas birlstone birlstone what do you make of it holmes it be obviously an attempt to convey secret information but what be the use of a cipher message without the cipher in this instance none at all why do you say in this instance because there be many cipher which i would read a easily a i do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude device amuse the intelligence without fatigue it but this be different it be clearly a reference to the word in a page of some book until i be tell which page and which book i be powerless but why douglas and birlstone clearly because those be word which be not contain in the page in question then why have he not indicate the book your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which be the delight of your friend would surely prevent you from inclose cipher and message in the same envelope should it miscarry you be undo a it be both have to go wrong before any harm come from it our second post be now overdue and i shall be surprise if it do not bring u either a far letter of explanation or a be more probable the very volume to which these figure refer holmes s calculation be fulfil within a very few minute by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we be expect the same write remark holmes a he open the envelope and actually sign he add in an exultant voice a he unfold the epistle come we be get on watson his brow cloud however a he glance over the content dear me this be very disappoint i fear watson that all our expectation come to nothing i trust that the man porlock will come to no harm dear mr holmes he say i will go no far in this matter it be too dangerous he suspect me i can see that he suspect me he come to me quite unexpectedly after i have actually address this envelope with the intention of send you the key to the cipher i be able to cover it up if he have see it it would have go hard with me but i read suspicion in his eye please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you fred porlock holmes sit for some little time twist this letter between his finger and frown a he star into the fire after all he say at last there may be nothing in it it may be only his guilty conscience know himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the other s eye the other be i presume professor moriarty no less when any of that party talk about he you know whom they mean there be one predominant he for all of them but what can he do hum that s a large question when you have one of the first brain of europe up against you and all the power of darkness at his back there be infinite possibility anyhow friend porlock be evidently scar out of his sens kindly compare the write in the note to that upon it envelope which be do he tell u before this ill omen visit the one be clear and firm the other hardly legible why do he write at all why do he not simply drop it because he fear i would make some inquiry after him in that case and possibly bring trouble on him no doubt say i of course i have pick up the original cipher message and be bend my brow over it it s pretty madden to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it be beyond human power to penetrate it sherlock holmes have push away his untasted breakfast and light the unsavoury pipe which be the companion of his deep meditation i wonder say he lean back and star at the ceiling perhaps there be point which have escape your machiavellian intellect let u consider the problem in the light of pure reason this man s reference be to a book that be our point of departure a somewhat vague one let u see then if we can narrow it down a i focus my mind upon it it seem rather less impenetrable what indication have we a to this book none well well it be surely not quite so bad a that the cipher message begin with a large do it not we may take it a a work hypothesis that be the particular page to which the cipher refer so our book have already become a large book which be surely something gain what other indication have we a to the nature of this large book the next sign be c what do you make of that watson chapter the second no doubt hardly that watson you will i be sure agree with me that if the page be give the number of the chapter be immaterial also that if page find u only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have be really intolerable column i cry brilliant watson you be scintillate this morning if it be not column then i be very much deceive so now you see we begin to visualize a large book print in double column which be each of a considerable length since one of the word be number in the document a the two hundred and ninety third have we reach the limit of what reason can supply i fear that we have surely you do yourself an injustice one more coruscation my dear watson yet another brain wave have the volume be an unusual one he would have send it to me instead of that he have intend before his plan be nip to send me the clue in this envelope he say so in his note this would seem to indicate that the book be one which he think i would have no difficulty in find for myself he have it and he imagine that i would have it too in short watson it be a very common book what you say certainly sound plausible so we have contract our field of search to a large book print in double column and in common use the bible i cry triumphantly good watson good but not if i may say so quite good enough even if i accept the compliment for myself i could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of moriarty s associate besides the edition of holy writ be so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copy would have the same pagination this be clearly a book which be standardize he know for certain that his page will exactly agree with my page but very few book would correspond with that exactly therein lie our salvation our search be narrow down to standardize book which anyone may be suppose to possess bradshaw there be difficulty watson the vocabulary of bradshaw be nervous and terse but limit the selection of word would hardly lend itself to the send of general message we will eliminate bradshaw the dictionary be i fear inadmissible for the same reason what then be leave an almanac excellent watson i be very much mistake if you have not touch the spot an almanac let u consider the claim of whitaker s almanac it be in common use it have the requisite number of page it be in double column though reserve in it early vocabulary it become if i remember right quite garrulous towards the end he pick the volume from his desk here be page column two a substantial block of print deal i perceive with the trade and resource of british india jot down the word watson number thirteen be mahratta not i fear a very auspicious begin number one hundred and twenty seven be government which at least make sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty now let u try again what do the mahratta government do ala the next word be pig s bristle we be undo my good watson it be finish he have speak in jest vein but the twitch of his bushy eyebrow bespeak his disappointment and irritation i sit helpless and unhappy star into the fire a long silence be break by a sudden exclamation from holmes who dash at a cupboard from which he emerge with a second yellow cover volume in his hand we pay the price watson for be too up to date he cry we be before our time and suffer the usual penalty be the seventh of january we have very properly lay in the new almanac it be more than likely that porlock take his message from the old one no doubt he would have tell u so have his letter of explanation be write now let u see what page have in store for u number thirteen be there which be much more promise number one hundred and twenty seven be be there be holmes s eye be gleam with excitement and his thin nervous finger twitch a he count the word danger ha ha capital put that down watson there be danger may come very soon one then we have the name douglas rich country now at birlstone house birlstone confidence be press there watson what do you think of pure reason and it fruit if the greengrocer have such a thing a a laurel wreath i should send billy round for it i be star at the strange message which i have scrawl a he decipher it upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee what a queer scramble way of express his mean say i on the contrary he have do quite remarkably well say holmes when you search a single column for word with which to express your mean you can hardly expect to get everything you want you be bind to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent the purport be perfectly clear some deviltry be intend against one douglas whoever he may be reside a state a rich country gentleman he be sure confidence be a near a he could get to confident that it be press there be our result and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it be holmes have the impersonal joy of the true artist in his well work even a he mourn darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspire he be still chuckle over his success when billy swing open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard be usher into the room those be the early day at the end of the s when alec macdonald be far from have attain the national fame which he have now achieve he be a young but trust member of the detective force who have distinguish himself in several case which have be entrust to him his tall bony figure give promise of exceptional physical strength while his great cranium and deep set lustrous eye speak no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkle out from behind his bushy eyebrow he be a silent precise man with a dour nature and a hard aberdonian accent twice already in his career have holmes help him to attain success his own sole reward be the intellectual joy of the problem for this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his amateur colleague be profound and he show them by the frankness with which he consult holmes in every difficulty mediocrity know nothing high than itself but talent instantly recognize genius and macdonald have talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there be no humiliation in seek the assistance of one who already stand alone in europe both in his gift and in his experience holmes be not prone to friendship but he be tolerant of the big scotchman and smile at the sight of him you be an early bird mr mac say he i wish you luck with your worm i fear this mean that there be some mischief afoot if you say hope instead of fear it would be near the truth i m think mr holmes the inspector answer with a know grin well maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill no i win t smoke i thank you i ll have to be push on my way for the early hour of a case be the precious one a no man know well than your own self but but the inspector have stop suddenly and be star with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table it be the sheet upon which i have scrawl the enigmatic message douglas he stammer birlstone what s this mr holmes man it s witchcraft where in the name of all that be wonderful do you get those name it be a cipher that dr watson and i have have occasion to solve but why what s amiss with the name the inspector look from one to the other of u in daze astonishment just this say he that mr douglas of birlstone manor house be horribly murder last night chapter sherlock holmes discourse it be one of those dramatic moment for which my friend exist

away from it an admirable if somewhat old fashion literary and historical education night be effect by work through every book which be allude to in the essay i should be curious however to know the exact age of the youth when he come to the end of his study i wish macaulay have write a historical novel i be convince that it would have be a great one i do not know if he have the power of draw an imaginary character but he certainly have the gift of reconstruct a dead celebrity to a remarkable degree look at the simple half paragraph in which he give u johnson and his atmosphere be ever a more definite picture give in a short space a we close it the club room be before u and the table on which stand the omelet for nugent and the lemon for johnson there be assemble those head which live for ever on the canvas of reynolds there be the spectacle of burke and the tall thin form of langton the courtly sneer of beauclerk and the beam smile of garrick gibbon tap his snuff box and sir joshua with his trumpet in his ear in the foreground be that strange figure which be a familiar to u a the figure of those among whom we have be bring up the gigantic body the huge massy face seam with the scar of disease the brown coat the black worsted stock the grey wig with the scorch foretop the dirty hand the nail bite and par to the quick we see the eye and mouth move with convulsive twitch we see the heavy form roll we hear it puff and then come the why sir and the what then sir and the no sir and the you don t see your way through the question sir it be etch into your memory for ever i can remember that when i visit london at the age of sixteen the first thing i do after housing my luggage be to make a pilgrimage to macaulay s grave where he lie in westminster abbey just under the shadow of addison and amid the dust of the poet whom he have love so well it be the one great object of interest which london hold for me and so it might well be when i think of all i owe him it be not merely the knowledge and the stimulation of fresh interest but it be the charm gentlemanly tone the broad liberal outlook the general absence of bigotry and of prejudice my judgment now confirm all that i felt for him then my four volume edition of the history stand a you see to the right of the essay do you recollect the third chapter of that work the one which reconstruct the england of the seventeenth century it have always seem to me the very high water mark of macaulay s power with it marvellous mixture of precise fact and romantic phrasing the population of town the statistic of commerce the prosaic fact of life be all transmute into wonder and interest by the handle of the master you feel that he could have cast a glamour over the multiplication table have he set himself to do so take a single concrete example of what i mean the fact that a londoner in the country or a countryman in london felt equally out of place in those day of difficult travel would seem to hardly require state and to afford no opportunity of leave a strong impression upon the reader s mind see what macaulay make of it though it be no more than a hundred other paragraph which discus a hundred various point a cockney in a rural village be star at a much a if he have intrude into a kraal of hottentot on the other hand when the lord of a lincolnshire or shropshire manor appear in fleet street he be a easily distinguish from the resident population a a turk or a lascar his dress his gait his accent the manner in which he gaze at the shop stumble into gutter run against the porter and stand under the waterspout mark him out a an excellent subject for the operation of swindler and banterers bully jostle him into the kennel hackney coachman splash him from head to foot thief explore with perfect security the huge pocket of his horseman s coat while he stand entrance by the splendour of the lord mayor s show money dropper sore from the cart s tail introduce themselves to him and appear to him the most honest friendly gentleman that he have ever see paint woman the refuse of lewkner lane and whetstone park pass themselves on him for count and maid of honour if he ask his way to st james his informant send him to mile end if he go into a shop he be instantly discern to be a fit purchaser of everything that nobody else would buy of second hand embroidery copper ring and watch that would not go if he ramble into any fashionable coffee house he become a mark for the insolent derision of fop and the grave waggery of templar enrage and mortify he soon return to his mansion and there in the homage of his tenant and the conversation of his boon companion find consolation for the vexation and humiliation which he have undergo there he be once more a great man and saw nothing above himself except when at the assize he take his seat on the bench near the judge or when at the muster of the militia he salute the lord lieutenant on the whole i should put this detach chapter of description at the very head of his essay though it happen to occur in another volume the history a a whole do not a it seem to me reach the same level a the short article one can not but feel that it be a brilliant piece of special plead from a fervid whig and that there must be more to be say for the other side than be there set forth some of the essay be ting also no doubt by his own political and religious limitation the best be those which get right away into the broad field of literature and philosophy johnson walpole madame d arblay addison and the two great indian one clive and warren hastings be my own favourite frederick the great too must surely stand in the first rank only one would i wish to eliminate it be the diabolically clever criticism upon montgomery one would have wish to think that macaulay s heart be too kind and his soul too gentle to pen so bitter an attack bad work will sink of it own weight it be not necessary to souse the author a well one would think more highly of the man if he have not do that savage bit of work i don t know why talk of macaulay always make me think of scott whose book in a fade olive back line have a shelf you see of their own perhaps it be that they both have so great an influence and wake such admiration in me or perhaps it be the real similarity in the mind and character of the two men you don t see it you say well just think of scott s border ballad and then of macaulay s lay the machine must be alike when the product be so similar each be the only man who could possibly have write the poem of the other what swing and dash in both of them what a love of all that be and noble and martial so simple and yet so strong but there be mind on which strength and simplicity be throw away they think that unless a thing be obscure it must be superficial whereas it be often the shallow stream which be turbid and the deep which be clear do you remember the fatuous criticism of matthew arnold upon the glorious lay where he call out be this poetry after quote and how can man die well than face fearful odds for the ash of his father and the temple of his god in try to show that macaulay have not the poetic sense he be really show that he himself have not the dramatic sense the baldness of the idea and of the language have evidently offend him but this be exactly where the true merit lie macaulay be give the rough blunt word with which a simple mind soldier appeal to two comrade to help him in a deed of valour any high fly sentiment would have be absolutely out of character the line be i think take with their context admirable ballad poetry and have just the dramatic quality and sense which a ballad poet must have that opinion of arnold s shake my faith in his
78,arthurDoyle_warInSouthAfrica,arthur_doyle,59125,﻿ chapter i the boer people it be impossible to appreciate the south african problem and the cause which have lead up to the present war between the british empire and the boer republic without some knowledge however superficial of the past history of south africa to tell the tale one must go back to the begin for there have be complete continuity of history in south africa and every stage have depend upon that which have precede it no one can know or appreciate the boer who do not know his past for he be what his past have make him it be about the time when oliver cromwell be at his zenith in to be pedantically accurate that the dutch make their first lodgment at the cape of good hope the portuguese have be there before them but repel by the evil weather and lure forward by rumour of gold they have pass the true seat of empire and have voyage far to settle along the eastern coast but the dutchman at the cape prosper and grow strong in that robust climate they do not penetrate far inland for they be few in number and all they want be to be find close at hand but they build themselves house and they supply the dutch east india company with food and water gradually bud off little townlets wynberg stellenbosch and push their settlement up the long slop which lead to that great central plateau which extend for mile from the edge of the karoo to the valley of the zambesi for a hundred more year the history of the colony be a record of the gradual spread of the africander over the huge expanse of veldt which lay to the north of them cattle raise become an industry but in a country where six acre can hardly support a sheep large farm be necessary for even small herd six thousand acre be the usual size and l a year the rent payable to government the disease which follow the white man have in africa a in america and australia be fatal to the native and an epidemic of smallpox clear the country for the new comer far and far north they push found little town here and there such a graaf reinet and swellendam where a dutch reform church and a store for the sale of the bare necessary of life form a nucleus for a few scatter dwell already the settler be show that independence of control and that detachment from europe which have be their most prominent characteristic even the mild sway of the dutch company have cause them to revolt the local rise however be hardly notice in the universal cataclysm which follow the french revolution after twenty year during which the world be shake by the titanic struggle in the final count up of the game and pay of the stake the cape colony be add in to the british empire in all the vast collection of british state there be probably not one the title deed to which be more incontestable than to this britain have it by two right the right of conquest and the right of purchase in troop land defeat the local force and take possession of cape town in britain pay the large sum of six million pound to the stadtholder for the transference of this and some south american land it be a bargain which be probably make rapidly and carelessly in that general redistribution which be go on a a house of call upon the way to india the place be see to be of value but the country itself be look upon a unprofitable and desert what would castlereagh or liverpool have think could they have see the item which they be buy for six million pound the inventory would have be a mix one of good and of evil nine fierce kaffir war the greatest diamond mine in the world the wealthiest gold mine two costly and humiliate campaign with men whom we respect even when we fight with them and now at last we hope a south africa of peace and prosperity with equal right and equal duty for all men the title deed to the estate be a i have say good one but there be one singular and ominous flaw in their provision the ocean have mark three boundary to it but the fourth be undefined there be no word of the hinterland for neither the term nor the idea have then be think of have great britain buy those vast region which extend beyond the settlement or be the discontent dutch at liberty to pass onwards and find fresh nation to bar the path of the anglo celtic colonist in that question lay the germ of all the trouble to come an american would realise the point at issue if he could conceive that after the found of the unite state the dutch inhabitant of the state of new york have trek to the westward and establish fresh community under a new flag then when the american population overtake these western state they would be face to face with the problem which this country have have to solve if they find these new state fiercely anti american and extremely unprogressive they would experience that aggravation of their difficulty with which british statesman have have to deal at the time of their transference to the british flag the colonist dutch french and german number some thirty thousand they be slaveholder and the slave be about a numerous a themselves the prospect of complete amalgamation between the british and the original settler would have seem to be a good one since they be of much the same stock and their creed could only be distinguish by their vary degree of bigotry and intolerance five thousand british emigrant be land in settle on the eastern border of the colony and from that time onwards there be a slow but steady influx of english speak colonist the government have the historical fault and the historical virtue of british rule it be mild clean honest tactless and inconsistent on the whole it might have do very well have it be content to leave thing a it find them but to change the habit of the most conservative of teutonic race be a dangerous venture and one which have lead to a long series of complication make up the trouble history of south africa the imperial government have always take an honourable and philanthropic view of the right of the native and the claim which he have to the protection of the law we hold and rightly that british justice if not blind should at least be colour blind the view be irreproachable in theory and incontestable in argument but it be apt to be irritate when urge by a boston moralist or a london philanthropist upon men whose whole society have be build upon the assumption that the black be the inferior race such a people like to find the high morality for themselves not to have it impose upon them by those who live under entirely different condition the british government in south africa have always play the unpopular part of the friend and protector of the native servant it be upon this very point that the first friction appear between the old settler and the new administration a rise with bloodshed follow the arrest of a dutch farmer who have maltreat his slave it be suppress and five of the participant be hang this punishment be unduly severe and exceedingly injudicious a brave race can forget the victim of the field of battle but never those of the scaffold the make of political martyr be the last insanity of statesmanship however the thing be do and it be typical of the endure resentment which be leave behind that when after the jameson raid it seem that the leader of that ill fat venture might be hang the beam be actually bring from a farmhouse at cookhouse drift to pretoria that the englishman might die a the dutchman have die in slagter s nek mark the divide of the way between the british government and the africander and the separation soon become more mark with vicarious generosity the english government give very lenient term to the kaffir tribe who in have raid the border farmer and then finally in this same year there come the emancipation of the slave throughout the british empire which fan all smoulder discontent into an active flame it must be confess that on this occasion the british philanthropist be will to pay for what he think be right it be a noble national action and one the morality of which be in advance of it time that the british parliament should vote the enormous sum of twenty million pound to pay compensation to the slaveholder and so to remove an evil with which the mother country have no immediate connection it be a well that the thing should have be do when it be for have we wait till the colony affect have government of their own it could never have be do by constitutional method with many a grumble the good british householder draw his purse from his fob and pay for what he think to be right if any special grace attend the virtuous action which bring nothing but tribulation in this world then we may hope for it over this emancipation we spend our money we ruin our west indian colony and we start a disaffection in south africa the end of which we have not see but the detail of the measure be less honourable than the principle it be carry out suddenly so that the country have no time to adjust itself to the new condition three million pound be ear mark for south africa which give a price per slave of from l to l a sum considerably below the current local rat finally the compensation be make payable in london so that the farmer sell their claim at reduce price to middleman indignation meet be hold in every little townlet and cattle camp on the karoo the old dutch spirit be up the spirit of the men who cut the dyke rebellion be useless but a vast untenanted land stretch to the north of them the nomad life be congenial to them and in their huge ox draw wagon like those bullock cart in which some of their old kinsman come to gaul they have vehicle and home and fort all in one one by one they be load up the huge team be inspan the woman be seat inside the men with their long barrel gun walk alongside and the great exodus be begin their herd and flock accompany the migration and the child help to round them in and drive them one tattered little boy of ten crack his sjambok whip behind the bullock he be a small item in that singular crowd but he be of interest to u for his name be paul stephanus kruger it be a strange exodus only comparable in modern time to the sallying forth of the mormon from nauvoo upon their search for the promise land of utah the country be know and sparsely settle a far north a the orange river but beyond there be a great region which have never be penetrate save by some dare hunter or adventurous pioneer it chance if there be indeed such an element a chance in the graver affair of man that a zulu conqueror have sweep over this land and leave it untenanted save by the dwarf bushman the hideous aborigine low of the human race there be fine graze and good soil for the emigrant they travel in small detach party but their total number be considerable from six to ten thousand accord to their historian or nearly a quarter of the whole population of the colony some of the early band perish miserably a large number make a trysting place at a high peak to the east of bloemfontein in what be lately the orange free state one party of the emigrant be cut off by the formidable matabeli a branch of the great zulu nation the final victory of the voortrekkers clear all the country between the orange river and the limpopo the sit of what have be know a the transvaal and the orange free state in the meantime another body of the emigrant have descend into natal and have defeat dingaan the great chief of the zulu and now at the end of their great journey after overcome the difficulty of distance of nature and of savage enemy the boer saw at the end of their travel the very thing which they desire least that which they have come so far to avoid the flag of great britain the boer have occupy natal from within but england have previously do the same by sea and a small colony of englishman have settle at port natal now know a durban the home government however have act in a vacillate way and it be only the conquest of natal by the boer which cause them to claim it a a british colony at the same time they assert the unwelcome doctrine that a british subject could not at will throw off his allegiance and that go where they might the wander farmer be still only the pioneer of british colony to emphasise the fact three company of soldier be send in to what be now durban the usual corporal s guard with which great britain start a new empire this handful of men be waylay by the boer and cut up a their successor have be so often since the survivor however fortify themselves and hold a defensive position a also their successor have do so many time since until reinforcement arrive and the farmer disperse natal from this time onward become a british colony and the majority of the boer trek north and east with bitter heart to tell their wrong to their brother of the orange free state and of the transvaal have they any wrong to tell it be difficult to reach that height of philosophic detachment which enable the historian to deal absolutely impartially where his own country be a party to the quarrel but at least we may allow that there be a case for our adversary our annexation of natal have be by no mean definite and it be they and not we who first break that bloodthirsty zulu power which throw it shadow across the country it be hard after such trial and such exploit to turn their back upon the fertile land which they have conquer and to return to the bare pasture of the upland veldt they carry out of natal a heavy sense of injury which have help to poison our relation with them ever since it be in a way a momentous episode this little skirmish of soldier and emigrant for it be the head off of the boer from the sea and the confinement of his ambition to the land have it go the other way a new and possibly formidable flag would have be add to the maritime nation the emigrant who have settle in the huge tract of country between the orange river in the south and the limpopo in the north have be recruit by new comer from the cape colony until they number some fifteen thousand soul this population be scatter over a space a large a germany and large than pennsylvania new york and new england their form of government be individualistic and democratic to the last degree compatible with any sort of cohesion their war with the kaffir and their fear and dislike of the british government appear to have be the only tie which hold them together they divide and subdivide within their own border like a germinate egg the transvaal be full of lusty little high mettled community who quarrel among themselves a fiercely a they have do with the authority at the cape lydenburg zoutpansberg and potchefstroom be on the point of turn their rifle against each other in the south between the orange river and the vaal there be no form of government at all but a welter of dutch farmer basuto hottentot and half breed live in a chronic state of turbulence recognise neither the british authority to the south of them nor the transvaal republic to the north the chaos become at last unendurable and in a garrison be place in bloemfontein and the district incorporate in the british empire the emigrant make a futile resistance at boomplaats and after a single defeat allow themselves to be draw into the settle order of civilise rule at this period the transvaal where most of the boer have settle desire a formal acknowledgment of their independence which the british authority determine once and for all to give them the great barren country which produce little save marksman have no attraction for a colonial office which be bend upon the limitation of it liability a convention be conclude between the two party know a the sand river convention which be one of the fix point in south african history by it the british government guarantee to the boer farmer the right to manage their own affair and to govern themselves by their own law without any interference upon the part of the british it stipulate that there should be no slavery and with that single reservation wash it hand finally a it imagine of the whole question so the transvaal republic come formally into existence in the very year after the sand river convention a second republic the orange free state be create by the deliberate withdrawal of great britain from the territory which she have for eight year occupy the eastern question be already

in petersburg under bolshevik rule passenger aeroplane in flight a peaceful garden in england i the world in space the story of our world be a story that be still very imperfectly know a couple of hundred year ago men possess the history of little more than the last three thousand year what happen before that time be a matter of legend and speculation over a large part of the civilize world it be believe and teach that the world have be create suddenly in b c though authority differ a to whether this have occur in the spring or autumn of that year this fantastically precise misconception be base upon a too literal interpretation of the hebrew bible and upon rather arbitrary theological assumption connect therewith such idea have long since be abandon by religious teacher and it be universally recognize that the universe in which we live have to all appearance exist for an enormous period of time and possibly for endless time of course there may be deception in these appearance a a room may be make to seem endless by put mirror face each other at either end but that the universe in which we live have exist only for six or seven thousand year may be regard a an altogether explode idea the earth a everybody know nowadays be a spheroid a sphere slightly compress orange fashion with a diameter of nearly mile it spherical shape have be know at least to a limit number of intelligent people for nearly year but before that time it be suppose to be flat and various idea which now seem fantastic be entertain about it relation to the sky and the star and planet we know now that it rotate upon it axis which be about mile short than it equatorial diameter every twenty four hour and that this be the cause of the alternation of day and night that it circle about the sun in a slightly distort and slowly variable oval path in a year it distance from the sun vary between ninety one and a half million at it near and ninety four and a half million mile illustration luminous spiral cloud of matter about the earth circle a small sphere the moon at an average distance of mile earth and moon be not the only body to travel round the sun there be also the planet mercury and venus at distance of thirty six and sixty seven million of mile and beyond the circle of the earth and disregard a belt of numerous small body the planetoid there be mar jupiter saturn uranus and neptune at mean distance of and million of mile respectively these figure in million of mile be very difficult for the mind to grasp it may help the reader s imagination if we reduce the sun and planet to a small more conceivable scale illustration the nebula see edge on if then we represent our earth a a little ball of one inch diameter the sun would be a big globe nine foot across and yard away that be about a fifth of a mile four or five minute walk the moon would be a small pea two foot and a half from the world between earth and sun there would be the two inner planet mercury and venus at distance of one hundred and twenty five and two hundred and fifty yard from the sun all round and about these body there would be emptiness until you come to mar a hundred and seventy five foot beyond the earth jupiter nearly a mile away a foot in diameter saturn a little small two mile off uranus four mile off and neptune six mile off then nothingness and nothingness except for small particle and drift scrap of attenuate vapour for thousand of mile the near star to earth on this scale would be mile away these figure will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the immense emptiness of space in which the drama of life go on for in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life only upon the surface of our earth it do not penetrate much more than three mile down into the mile that separate u from the centre of our globe and it do not reach more than five mile above it surface apparently all the limitlessness of space be otherwise empty and dead the deep ocean dredge go down to five mile the high record flight of an aeroplane be little more than four mile men have reach to seven mile up in balloon but at a cost of great suffer no bird can fly so high a five mile and small bird and insect which have be carry up by aeroplane drop off insensible far below that level ii the world in time in the last fifty year there have be much very fine and interest speculation on the part of scientific men upon the age and origin of our earth here we can not pretend to give even a summary of such speculation because they involve the most subtle mathematical and physical consideration the truth be that the physical and astronomical science be still too undeveloped a yet to make anything of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork the general tendency have be to make the estimate age of our globe long and long it now seem probable that the earth have have an independent existence a a spin planet fly round and round the sun for a long period than year it may have be much long than that this be a length of time that absolutely overpower the imagination before that vast period of separate existence the sun and earth and the other planet that circulate round the sun may have be a great swirl of diffuse matter in space the telescope reveal to u in various part of the heaven luminous spiral cloud of matter the spiral nebulæ which appear to be in rotation about a centre it be suppose by many astronomer that the sun and it planet be once such a spiral and that their matter have undergo concentration into it present form through majestic æons that concentration go on until in that vast remoteness of the past for which we have give figure the world and it moon be distinguishable they be spin then much fast than they be spin now they be at a less distance from the sun they travel round it very much fast and they be probably incandescent or melt at the surface the sun itself be a much great blaze in the heaven illustration the great spiral nebula if we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth in this early stage of it history we should behold a scene more like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow before it cool and cake over than any other contemporary scene no water would be visible because all the water there be would still be superheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapour beneath this would swirl and boil an ocean of melt rock substance across a sky of fiery cloud the glare of the hurry sun and moon would sweep swiftly like hot breath of flame illustration a dark nebula slowly by degree a one million of year follow another this fiery scene would lose it eruptive incandescence the vapour in the sky would rain down and become less dense overhead great slaggy cake of solidify rock would appear upon the surface of the melt sea and sink under it to be replace by other float mass the sun and moon grow now each more distant and each small would rush with diminish swiftness across the heaven the moon now because of it small size would be already cool far below incandescence and would be alternately obstruct and reflect the sunlight in a series of eclipse and full moon illustration another spiral nebula and so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time the earth would grow more and more like the earth on which we live until at last an age would come when in the cool air steam would begin to condense into cloud and the first rain would fall hiss upon the first rock below for endless millenia the great part of the earth s water would still be vaporize in the atmosphere but there would now be hot stream run over the crystallize rock below and pool and lake into which these stream would be carry detritus and deposit sediment illustration landscape before life at last a condition of thing must have be attain in

busy themselves about their various concern they be scrutinise and study perhaps almost a narrowly a a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creature that swarm and multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency men go to and fro over this globe about their little affair serene in their assurance of their empire over matter it be possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same no one give a think to the old world of space a source of human danger or think of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them a impossible or improbable it be curious to recall some of the mental habit of those depart day at most terrestrial men fancy there might be other men upon mar perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space mind that be to our mind a ours be to those of the beast that perish intellect vast and cool and unsympathetic regard this earth with envious eye and slowly and surely draw their plan against u and early in the twentieth century come the great disillusionment the planet mar i scarcely need remind the reader revolve about the sun at a mean distance of mile and the light and heat it receive from the sun be barely half of that receive by this world it must be if the nebular hypothesis have any truth old than our world and long before this earth cease to be melt life upon it surface must have begin it course the fact that it be scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerate it cool to the temperature at which life could begin it have air and water and all that be necessary for the support of animate existence yet so vain be man and so blind by his vanity that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century express any idea that intelligent life might have develop there far or indeed at all beyond it earthly level nor be it generally understand that since mar be old than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remote from the sun it necessarily follow that it be not only more distant from time ’ s begin but near it end the secular cool that must someday overtake our planet have already go far indeed with our neighbour it physical condition be still largely a mystery but we know now that even in it equatorial region the midday temperature barely approach that of our cold winter it air be much more attenuate than ours it ocean have shrink until they cover but a third of it surface and a it slow season change huge snowcap gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate it temperate zone that last stage of exhaustion which to u be still incredibly remote have become a present day problem for the inhabitant of mar the immediate pressure of necessity have brighten their intellect enlarge their power and harden their heart and look across space with instrument and intelligence such a we have scarcely dream of they see at it near distance only of mile sunward of them a morning star of hope our own warm planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility with glimpse through it drift cloud wisp of broad stretch of populous country and narrow navy crowd sea and we men the creature who inhabit this earth must be to them at least a alien and lowly a be the monkey and lemur to u the intellectual side of man already admit that life be an incessant struggle for existence and it would seem that this too be the belief of the mind upon mar their world be far go in it cool and this world be still crowd with life but crowd only with what they regard a inferior animal to carry warfare sunward be indeed their only escape from the destruction that generation after generation creep upon them and before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own specie have work not only upon animal such a the vanish bison and the dodo but upon it inferior race the tasmanians in spite of their human likeness be entirely sweep out of existence in a war of extermination wag by european immigrant in the space of fifty year be we such apostle of mercy a to complain if the martian war in the same spirit the martian seem to have calculate their descent with amaze subtlety—their mathematical learn be evidently far in excess of ours—and to have carry out their preparation with a well nigh perfect unanimity have our instrument permit it we might have see the gather trouble far back in the nineteenth century men like schiaparelli watch the red planet—it be odd by the bye that for countless century mar have be the star of war—but fail to interpret the fluctuate appearance of the mark they map so well all that time the martian must have be get ready during the opposition of a great light be see on the illuminate part of the disk first at the lick observatory then by perrotin of nice and then by other observer english reader hear of it first in the issue of nature date august i be incline to think that this blaze may have be the cast of the huge gun in the vast pit sink into their planet from which their shot be fire at u peculiar mark a yet unexplained be see near the site of that outbreak during the next two opposition the storm burst upon u six year ago now a mar approach opposition lavelle of java set the wire of the astronomical exchange palpitate with the amaze intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet it have occur towards midnight of the twelfth and the spectroscope to which he have at once resort indicate a mass of flame gas chiefly hydrogen move with an enormous velocity towards this earth this jet of fire have become invisible about a quarter past twelve he compare it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirt out of the planet “ a flame gas rush out of a gun ” a singularly appropriate phrase it prove yet the next day there be nothing of this in the paper except a little note in the daily telegraph and the world go in ignorance of one of the gravest danger that ever threaten the human race i might not have hear of the eruption at all have i not meet ogilvy the well know astronomer at ottershaw he be immensely excite at the news and in the excess of his feel invite me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet in spite of all that have happen since i still remember that vigil very distinctly the black and silent observatory the shadow lantern throw a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner the steady tick of the clockwork of the telescope the little slit in the roof—an oblong profundity with the stardust streak across it ogilvy move about invisible but audible look through the telescope one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swim in the field it seem such a little thing so bright and small and still faintly mark with transverse strip and slightly flatten from the perfect round but so little it be so silvery warm—a pin ’ s head of light it be a if it quiver but really this be the telescope vibrate with the activity of the clockwork that keep the planet in view a i watch the planet seem to grow large and small and to advance and recede but that be simply that my eye be tire forty million of mile it be from us—more than forty million of mile of void few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swim near it in the field i remember be three faint point of light three telescopic star infinitely remote and all around it be the unfathomable darkness of empty space you know how that blackness look on a frosty starlight night in a telescope it seem far profound and invisible to me because it be so remote and small fly swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance draw near every minute by so many thousand of mile come the thing they be send u the thing that be to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth i never dream of it then a i watch no one on earth dream of that unerring missile that night too there be another jet out of gas from the distant planet i saw it a reddish flash at the edge the slight projection of the outline just a the chronometer strike midnight and at that i tell ogilvy and he take my place the night be warm and i be thirsty and i go stretch my leg clumsily and feel my way in the darkness to the little table where the siphon stand while ogilvy exclaim at the streamer of gas that come out towards u that night another invisible missile start on it way to the earth from mar just a second or so under twenty four hour after the first one i remember how i sit on the table there in the blackness with patch of green and crimson swim before my eye i wish i have a light to smoke by little suspect the mean of the minute gleam i have see and all that it would presently bring me ogilvy watch till one and then give it up and we light the lantern and walk over to his house down below in the darkness be ottershaw and chertsey and all their hundred of people sleeping in peace he be full of speculation that night about the condition of mar and scoff at the vulgar idea of it have inhabitant who be signal u his idea be that meteorite might be fall in a heavy shower upon the planet or that a huge volcanic explosion be in progress he point out to me how unlikely it be that organic evolution have take the same direction in the two adjacent planet “ the chance against anything manlike on mar be a million to one ” he say hundred of observer saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight and again the night after and so for ten night a flame each night why the shot cease after the tenth no one on earth have attempt to explain it may be the gas of the fire cause the martian inconvenience dense cloud of smoke or dust visible through a powerful telescope on earth a little grey fluctuate patch spread through the clearness of the planet ’ s atmosphere and obscure it more familiar feature even the daily paper wake up to the disturbance at last and popular note appear here there and everywhere concern the volcano upon mar the seriocomic periodical punch i remember make a happy use of it in the political cartoon and all unsuspected those missile the martian have fire at u draw earthward rush now at a pace of many mile a second through the empty gulf of space hour by hour and day by day near and near it seem to me now almost incredibly wonderful that with that swift fate hang over u men could go about their petty concern a they do i remember how jubilant markham be at secure a new photograph of the planet for the illustrate paper he edit in those day people in these latter time scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth century paper for my own part i be much occupy in learn to ride the bicycle and busy upon a series of paper discuss the probable development of moral idea a civilisation progress one night the first missile then could scarcely have be mile away i go for a walk with my wife it be starlight and i explain the sign of the zodiac to her and point out mar a bright dot of light creep zenithward towards which so many telescope be point it be a warm night come home a party of excursionist from chertsey or isleworth pass u sing and play music there be light in the upper window of the house a the people go to bed from the railway station in the distance come the sound of shunt train ring and rumble soften almost into melody by the distance my wife point out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal light hang in a framework against the sky it seem so safe and tranquil ii the fall star then come the night of the first fall star it be see early in the morning rush over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere hundred must have see it and take it for an ordinary fall star albin describe it a leave a greenish streak behind it that glow for some second denning our greatest authority on meteorite state that the height of it first appearance be about ninety or one hundred mile it seem to him that it fell to earth about one hundred mile east of him i be at home at that hour and write in my study and although my french window face towards ottershaw and the blind be up for i love in those day to look up at the night sky i saw nothing of it yet this strange of all thing that ever come to earth from out space must have fall while i be sit there visible to me have i only look up a it pass some of those who saw it flight say it travel with a hiss sound i myself hear nothing of that many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have see the fall of it and at most have think that another meteorite have descend no one seem to have trouble to look for the fall mass that night but very early in the morning poor ogilvy who have see the shoot star and who be persuade that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between horsell ottershaw and woking rise early with the idea of find it find it he do soon after dawn and not far from the sand pit an enormous hole have be make by the impact of the projectile and the sand and gravel have be fling violently in every direction over the heath form heap visible a mile and a half away the heather be on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rise against the dawn the thing itself lay almost entirely bury in sand amidst the scatter splinter of a fir tree it have shiver to fragment in it descent the uncover part have the appearance of a huge cylinder cake over and it outline soften by a thick scaly dun colour incrustation it have a diameter of about thirty yard he approach the mass surprise at the size and more so at the shape since most meteorite be round more or less completely it be however still so hot from it flight through the air a to forbid his near approach a stir noise within it cylinder he ascribe to the unequal cool of it surface for at that time it have not occur to him that it might be hollow he remain stand at the edge of the pit that the thing have make for itself star at it strange appearance astonish chiefly at it unusual shape and colour and dimly perceive even then some evidence of design in it arrival the early morning be wonderfully still and the sun just clear the pine tree towards weybridge be already warm he do not remember hearing any bird that morning there be certainly no breeze stir and the only sound be the faint movement from within the cindery cylinder he be all alone on the common then suddenly he notice with a start that some of the grey clinker the ashy incrustation that cover the meteorite be fall off the circular edge of the end it be drop off in flake and rain down upon the sand a large piece suddenly come off and fell with a sharp noise that bring his heart into his mouth for a minute he scarcely realise what this mean

of southern italy it come to me with a certain quality of astonishment that my participation in these amaze adventure of mr cavor be after all the outcome of the pure accident it might have be any one i fell into these thing at a time when i think myself remove from the slight possibility of disturb experience i have go to lympne because i have imagine it the most uneventful place in the world here at any rate say i i shall find peace and a chance to work and this book be the sequel so utterly at variance be destiny with all the little plan of men i may perhaps mention here that very recently i have come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprise sit now surround by all the circumstance of wealth there be a luxury in admit my extremity i can admit even that to a certain extent my disaster be conceivably of my own make it may be there be direction in which i have some capacity but the conduct of business operation be not among these but in those day i be young and my youth among other objectionable form take that of a pride in my capacity for affair i be young still in year but the thing that have happen to me have rub something of the youth from my mind whether they have bring any wisdom to light below it be a more doubtful matter it be scarcely necessary to go into the detail of the speculation that land me at lympne in kent nowadays even about business transaction there be a strong spice of adventure i take risk in these thing there be invariably a certain amount of give and take and it fell to me finally to do the give reluctantly enough even when i have get out of everything one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be malignant perhaps you have meet that flame sense of outrage virtue or perhaps you have only felt it he run me hard it seem to me at last that there be nothing for it but to write a play unless i want to drudge for my live a a clerk i have a certain imagination and luxurious taste and i mean to make a vigorous fight for it before that fate overtake me in addition to my belief in my power a a business man i have always in those day have an idea that i be equal to write a very good play it be not i believe a very uncommon persuasion i know there be nothing a man can do outside legitimate business transaction that have such opulent possibility and very probably that bias my opinion i have indeed get into the habit of regard this unwritten drama a a convenient little reserve put by for a rainy day that rainy day have come and i set to work i soon discover that write a play be a long business than i have suppose at first i have reckon ten day for it and it be to have a pied a terre while it be in hand that i come to lympne i reckon myself lucky in get that little bungalow i get it on a three year agreement i put in a few stick of furniture and while the play be in hand i do my own cook my cook would have shock mr bond and yet you know it have flavour i have a coffee pot a sauce pan for egg and one for potato and a fry pan for sausage and bacon such be the simple apparatus of my comfort one can not always be magnificent but simplicity be always a possible alternative for the rest i lay in an eighteen gallon cask of beer on credit and a trustful baker come each day it be not perhaps in the style of sybaris but i have have bad time i be a little sorry for the baker who be a very decent man indeed but even for him i hop certainly if any one want solitude the place be lympne it be in the clay part of kent and my bungalow stand on the edge of an old sea cliff and star across the flat of romney marsh at the sea in very wet weather the place be almost inaccessible and i have hear that at time the postman use to traverse the more succulent portion of his route with board upon his foot i never saw him do so but i can quite imagine it outside the door of the few cottage and house that make up the present village big birch besom be stick to wipe off the worst of the clay which will give some idea of the texture of the district i doubt if the place would be there at all if it be not a fade memory of thing go for ever it be the big port of england in roman time portus lemanis and now the sea be four mile away all down the steep hill be boulder and mass of roman brickwork and from it old watling street still pave in place start like an arrow to the north i use to stand on the hill and think of it all the galley and legion the captive and official the woman and trader the speculator like myself all the swarm and tumult that come clank in and out of the harbour and now just a few lump of rubble on a grassy slope and a sheep or two and i and where the port have be be the level of the marsh sweep round in a broad curve to distant dungeness and dot here and there with tree clump and the church tower of old medieval town that be follow lemanis now towards extinction that outlook on the marsh be indeed one of the fine view i have ever see i suppose dungeness be fifteen mile away it lay like a raft on the sea and far westward be the hill by hastings under the set sun sometimes they hang close and clear sometimes they be fade and low and often the drift of the weather take them clean out of sight and all the near part of the marsh be lace and light by ditch and canal the window at which i work look over the skyline of this crest and it be from this window that i first set eye on cavor it be just a i be struggle with my scenario hold down my mind to the sheer hard work of it and naturally enough he arrest my attention the sun have set the sky be a vivid tranquillity of green and yellow and against that he come out black the odd little figure he be a short round body thin legged little man with a jerky quality in his motion he have see fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a cricket cap an overcoat and cycle knickerbockers and stock why he do so i do not know for he never cycle and he never play cricket it be a fortuitous concurrence of garment arise i know not how he gesticulate with his hand and arm and jerk his head about and buzz he buzz like something electric you never hear such buzz and ever and again he clear his throat with a most extraordinary noise there have be rain and that spasmodic walk of his be enhance by the extreme slipperiness of the footpath exactly a he come against the sun he stop pull out a watch hesitate then with a sort of convulsive gesture he turn and retreat with every manifestation of haste no long gesticulate but go with ample stride that show the relatively large size of his foot they be i remember grotesquely exaggerate in size by adhesive clay to the best possible advantage this occur on the first day of my sojourn when my play write energy be at it height and i regard the incident simply a an annoying distraction the waste of five minute i return to my scenario but when next evening the apparition be repeat with remarkable precision and again the next evening and indeed every evening when rain be not fall concentration upon the scenario become a considerable effort confound the man i say one would think he be learn to be a marionette and for several evening i curse him pretty heartily then my annoyance give way to amazement and curiosity why on earth should a man do this thing on the fourteenth evening i could stand it no long and so soon a he appear i open the french window cross the verandah and direct myself to the point where he invariably stop he have his watch out a i come up to him he have a chubby rubicund face with reddish brown eye previously i have see him only against the light one moment sir say i a he turn he star one moment he say certainly or if you wish to speak to me for long and it be not ask too much your moment be up would it trouble you to accompany me not in the least say i place myself beside him my habit be regular my time for intercourse limit this i presume be your time for exercise it be i come here to enjoy the sunset you don t sir you never look at it never look at it no i ve watch you thirteen night and not once have you look at the sunset not once he knit his brow like one who encounter a problem well i enjoy the sunlight the atmosphere i go along this path through that gate he jerk his head over his shoulder and round you don t you never have be it s all nonsense there isn t a way to night for instance oh to night let me see ah i just glance at my watch saw that i have already be out just three minute over the precise half hour decide there be not time to go round turn you always do he look at me reflect perhaps i do now i come to think of it but what be it you want to speak to me about why this this yes why do you do it every night you come make a noise make a noise like this i imitate his buzz noise he look at me and it be evident the buzz awaken distaste do i do that he ask every bless evening i have no idea he stop dead he regard me gravely can it be he say that i have form a habit well it look like it doesn t it he pull down his lower lip between finger and thumb he regard a puddle at his foot my mind be much occupy he say and you want to know why well sir i can assure you that not only do i not know why i do these thing but i do not even know i do them come to think it be just a you say i never have be beyond that field and these thing annoy you for some reason i be begin to relent towards him not annoy i say but imagine yourself write a play i couldn t well anything that need concentration ah he say of course and meditate his expression become so eloquent of distress that i relent still more after all there be a touch of aggression in demand of a man you don t know why he hum on a public footpath you see he say weakly it s a habit oh i recognise that i must stop it but not if it put you out after all i have no business it s something of a liberty not at all sir he say not at all i be greatly indebted to you i should guard myself against these thing in future i will could i trouble you once again that noise something like this i say zuzzoo zuzzoo but really you know i be greatly oblige to you in fact i know i be get absurdly absent mind you be quite justify sir perfectly justify indeed i be indebted to you the thing shall end and now sir i have already bring you far than i should have do i do hope my impertinence not at all sir not at all we regard each other for a moment i raise my hat and wish him a good evening he respond convulsively and so we go our way at the stile i look back at his recede figure his bear have change remarkably he seem limp shrink the contrast with his former gesticulate zuzzoing self take me in some absurd way a pathetic i watch him out of sight then wish very heartily i have keep to my own business i return to my bungalow and my play the next evening i saw nothing of him nor the next but he be very much in my mind and it have occur to me that a a sentimental comic character he might serve a useful purpose in the development of my plot the third day he call upon me for a time i be puzzle to think what have bring him he make indifferent conversation in the most formal way then abruptly he come to business he want to buy me out of my bungalow you see he say i don t blame you in the least but you ve destroy a habit and it disorganise my day i ve walk past here for year year no doubt i ve hum you ve make all that impossible i suggest he might try some other direction no there be no other direction this be the only one i ve inquire and now every afternoon at four i come to a dead wall but my dear sir if the thing be so important to you it s vital you see i m i m an investigator i be engage in a scientific research i live he pause and seem to think just over there he say and point suddenly dangerously near my eye the house with white chimney you see just over the tree and my circumstance be abnormal abnormal i be on the point of complete one of the most important demonstration i can assure you one of the most important demonstration that have ever be make it require constant think constant mental ease and activity and the afternoon be my bright time effervesce with new idea new point of view but why not come by still it would be all different i should be self conscious i should think of you at your play watch me irritate instead of think of my work no i must have the bungalow i meditate naturally i want to think the matter over thoroughly before anything decisive be say i be generally ready enough for business in those day and sell always attract me but in the first place it be not my bungalow and even if i sell it to him at a good price i might get inconvenience in the delivery of good if the current owner get wind of the transaction and in the second i be well undischarged it be clearly a business that require delicate handle moreover the possibility of his be in pursuit of some valuable invention also interest me it occur to me that i would like to know more of this research not with any dishonest intention but simply with an idea that to know what it be would be a relief from play write i throw out feeler he be quite will to supply information indeed once he be fairly under way the conversation become a monologue he talk like a man long pen up who have have it over with himself again and again he talk for nearly an hour and i must confess i find it a pretty stiff bit of listen but through it all there be the undertone of satisfaction one feel when one be neglect work one have set oneself during that first interview i gather very little of the drift of his work half his word be technicality entirely strange to me and he illustrate one or two point with what he be please to call elementary mathematics computing on an envelope with a copy ink pencil in a manner that make it hard even to seem to understand yes i say yes go on nevertheless i make out enough to convince me that he be no mere crank play at discovery in spite of his crank like appearance there be a force about him that make that impossible whatever it be it be a thing with mechanical possibility he tell me of a work shed he have and of three assistant originally job carpenter whom he have train now from the work shed to the patent office be clearly only one step he invite me to see those thing i accept readily and take care by a remark or so to underline that the propose transfer of the bungalow remain very conveniently in suspense at last he rise to depart with an apology for the length of his call talk over his work be he say a pleasure enjoy only too rarely it be not often he find such an intelligent listener a myself he mingle very little with professional scientific men so much pettiness he explain so much intrigue and really when one have an idea a novel fertilise idea i don

three fantasia of possibility story which all turn on the possible development in the future of some contemporary force or group of force the world set free be write under the immediate shadow of the great war every intelligent person in the world felt that disaster be impend and know no way of averting it but few of u realise in the early half of how near the crash be to u the reader will be amuse to find that here it be put off until the year he may naturally want to know the reason for what will seem now a quite extraordinary delay a a prophet the author must confess he have always be incline to be rather a slow prophet the war aeroplane in the world of reality for example beat the forecast in anticipation by about twenty year or so i suppose a desire not to shock the sceptical reader ’ s sense of use and wont and perhaps a less creditable disposition to hedge have something to do with this date forward of one ’ s main event but in the particular case of the world set free there be i think another motive in hold the great war back and that be to allow the chemist to get well forward with his discovery of the release of atomic energy or for that matter may be none too late for that crown revolution in human potentiality and apart from this procrastination of over forty year the guess at the opening phase of the war be fairly lucky the forecast of an alliance of the central empire the opening campaign through the netherlands and the despatch of the british expeditionary force be all justify before the book have be publish six month and the opening section of chapter the second remain now after the reality have happen a fairly adequate diagnosis of the essential of the matter one happy hit in chapter the second section on which the writer may congratulate himself be the forecast that under modern condition it would be quite impossible for any great general to emerge to supremacy and concentrate the enthusiasm of the army of either side there could be no alexander or napoleon and we soon hear the scientific corp muttering ‘ these old fool ’ exactly a it be here foretell these however be small detail and the miss in the story far outnumber the hit it be the main thesis which be still of interest now the thesis that because of the development of scientific knowledge separate sovereign state and separate sovereign empire be no long possible in the world that to attempt to keep on with the old system be to heap disaster upon disaster for mankind and perhaps to destroy our race altogether the remain interest of this book now be the sustain validity of this thesis and the discussion of the possible ending of war on the earth i have suppose a sort of epidemic of sanity to break out among the ruler of state and the leader of mankind i have represent the native common sense of the french mind and of the english mind for manifestly king egbert be mean to be ‘ god ’ s englishman ’ lead mankind towards a bold and resolute effort of salvage and reconstruction instead of which a the school book footnote say compare to day ’ s newspaper instead of a frank and honourable gather of lead men englishman meet german and frenchman russian brother in their offence and in their disaster upon the hill of brissago behold in geneva at the other end of switzerland a poor little league of allied nation exclude the unite state russia and most of the ‘ subject people ’ of the world meet obscurely amidst a world wide disregard to make impotent gesture at the lead problem of the debacle either the disaster have not be vast enough yet or it have not be swift enough to inflict the necessary moral shock and achieve the necessary moral revulsion just a the world of be use to an increase prosperity and think that increase would go on for ever so now it would seem the world be grow accustom to a steady glide towards social disintegration and think that that too can go on continually and never come to a final bump so soon do use and wont establish themselves and the most flame and thunderous of lesson pale into disregard the question whether a leblanc be still possible the question whether it be still possible to bring about an outbreak of creative sanity in mankind to avert this steady glide to destruction be now one of the most urgent in the world it be clear that the writer be temperamentally dispose to hope that there be such a possibility but he have to confess that he see few sign of any such breadth of understand and steadfastness of will a an effectual effort to turn the rush of human affair demand the inertia of dead idea and old institution carry u on towards the rapid only in one direction be there any plain recognition of the idea of a human commonweal a something override any national and patriotic consideration and that be in the work class movement throughout the world and labour internationalism be closely bind up with conception of a profound social revolution if world peace be to be attain through labour internationalism it will have to be attain at the price of the complete social and economic reconstruction and by pass through a phase of revolution that will certainly be violent that may be very bloody which may be prolong through a long period and may in the end fail to achieve anything but social destruction nevertheless the fact remain that it be in the labour class and the

american review and be publish a a whole the same year the situation involve be gather up betimes that be in the second chapter of book fifth for the reader ’ s benefit into a few word a possible—planted or “ sink ” stiffly and saliently in the centre of the current almost perhaps to the obstruction of traffic never can a composition of this sort have spring straight from a drop grain of suggestion and never can that grain develop overgrow and smother have yet lurk more in the mass a an independent particle the whole case in fine be in lambert strether ’ s irrepressible outbreak to little bilham on the sunday afternoon in gloriani ’ s garden the candour with which he yield for his young friend ’ s enlightenment to the charm admonition of that crisis the idea of the tale reside indeed in the very fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have be felt by him a a crisis and he be at pain to express it for u a neatly a we could desire the remark to which he thus give utterance contain the essence of “ the ambassador ” his finger close before he have do round the stem of the full blow flower which after that fashion he continue officiously to present to u “ live all you can it ’ s a mistake not to it doesn ’ t so much matter what you do in particular so long a you have your life if you haven ’ t have that what have you have i ’ m too old—too old at any rate for what i see what one lose one lose make no mistake about that still we have the illusion of freedom therefore don ’ t like me to day be without the memory of that illusion i be either at the right time too stupid or too intelligent to have it and now i ’ m a case of reaction against the mistake do what you like so long a you don ’ t make it for it be a mistake live live ” such be the gist of strether ’ s appeal to the impress youth whom he like and whom he desire to befriend the word “ mistake ” occur several time it will be see in the course of his remarks—which give the measure of the signal warn he feel attach to his case he have accordingly miss too much though perhaps after all constitutionally qualify for a well part and he wake up to it in condition that press the spring of a terrible question would there yet perhaps be time for reparation —reparation that be for the injury do his character for the affront he be quite ready to say so stupidly put upon it and in which he have even himself have so clumsy a hand the answer to which be that he now at all event see so that the business of my tale and the march of my action not to say the precious moral of everything be just my demonstration of this process of vision nothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fit again into it germ that have be give me bodily a usual by the speak word for i be to take the image over exactly a i happen to have meet it a friend have repeat to me with great appreciation a thing or two say to him by a man of distinction much his senior and to which a sense akin to that of strether ’ s melancholy eloquence might be imputed—said a chance would have and so easily might in paris and in a charm old garden attach to a house of art and on a sunday afternoon of summer many person of great interest be present the observation there listen to and gather up have contain part of the “ note ” that i be to recognise on the spot a to my purpose—had contain in fact the great part the rest be in the place and the time and the scene they sketch these constituent cluster and combine to give me far support to give me what i may call the note absolute there it stand accordingly full in the tideway drive in with hard tap like some strong stake for the noose of a cable the swirl of the current roundabout it what amplify the hint to more than the bulk of hint in general be the gift with it of the old paris garden for in that token be seal up value infinitely precious there be of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate but somehow in the light of the hint all the element of a situation of the sort most to my taste be there i could even remember no occasion on which so confront i have find it of a lively interest to take stock in this fashion of suggest wealth for i think verily that there be degree of merit in subjects—in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time for the feverish and prejudice hour at least figure it merit and it dignity a possibly absolute what it come to doubtless be that even among the supremely good—since with such alone be it one ’ s theory of one ’ s honour to be concerned—there be an ideal beauty of goodness the invoke action of which be to raise the artistic faith to it maximum then truly i hold one ’ s theme may be say to shine and that of “ the ambassador ” i confess wear this glow for me from begin to end fortunately thus i be able to estimate this a frankly quite the best “ all round ” of all my production any failure of that justification would have make such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous i recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence never one of those alarm a for a suspect hollow beneath one ’ s foot a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopt under which confidence fail and opportunity seem but to mock if the motive of “ the wing of the dove ” a i have note be to worry me at moment by a seal up of it face—though without prejudice to it again of a sudden fairly grimace with expression—so in this other business i have absolute conviction and constant clearness to deal with it have be a frank proposition the whole bunch of data instal on my premise like a monotony of fine weather the order of composition in these thing i may mention be reverse by the order of publication the early write of the two book have appear a the late even under the weight of my hero ’ s year i could feel my postulate firm even under the strain of the difference between those of madame de vionnet and those of chad newsome a difference liable to be denounce a shock i could still feel it serene nothing resist nothing betray i seem to make out in this full and sound sense of the matter it shed from any side i could turn it to the same golden glow i rejoice in the promise of a hero so mature who would give me thereby the more to bite into—since it ’ s only into thicken motive and accumulate character i think that the painter of life bite more than a little my poor friend should have accumulate character certainly or rather would be quite naturally and handsomely possess of it in the sense that he would have and would always have felt he have imagination galore and that this yet wouldn ’ t have wreck him it be immeasurable the opportunity to “ do ” a man of imagination for if there mightn ’ t be a chance to “ bite ” where in the world might it be this personage of course so enrich wouldn ’ t give me for his type imagination in predominance or a his prime faculty nor should i in view of other matter have find that convenient so particular a luxury—some occasion that be for study of the high gift in supreme command of a case or of a career—would still doubtless come on the day i should be ready to pay for it and till then might a from far back remain hang up well in view and just out of reach the comparative case meanwhile would serve—it be only on the minor scale that i have treat myself even to comparative case i be to hasten to add however that happy stopgap a the minor scale have thus yield the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of the full range of the major since most immediately to the point be the question of that supplement of situation logically involve in our gentleman ’ s impulse to deliver himself in the paris garden on the sunday afternoon—or if not involve by strict logic then all ideally and enchantingly imply in it i say “ ideally ” because i need scarce mention that for development for expression of it maximum my glimmering story be at the early stage to have nip the thread of connexion with the possibility of the actual report speaker he remain but the happy of accident his actuality all too definite preclude any range of possibility it have only be his charm office to project upon that wide field of the artist ’ s vision—which hang there ever in place like the white sheet suspend for the figure of a child ’ s magic lantern—a more fantastic and more moveable shadow no privilege of the teller of tale and the handler of puppet be more delightful or have more of the suspense and the thrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly play than just this business of look for the unseen and the occult in a scheme half grasp by the light or so to speak by the cling scent of the gage already in hand no dreadful old pursuit of the hide slave with bloodhound and the rag of association can ever for “ excitement ” i judge have better it at it best for the dramatist always by the very law of his genius believe not only in a possible right issue from the rightly conceive tight place he do much more than this—he believe irresistibly in the necessary the precious “ tightness ” of the place whatever the issue on the strength of any respectable hint it be thus the respectable hint that i have with such avidity pick up what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the centre it be part of the charm attendant on such question that the “ story ” with the omen true a i say put on from this stage the authenticity of concrete existence it then be essentially—it begin to be though it may more or less obscurely lurk so that the point be not in the least what to make of it but only very delightfully and very damnably where to put one ’ s hand on it in which truth reside surely much of the interest of that admirable mixture for salutary application which we know a art art deal with what we see it must first contribute full hand that ingredient it pluck it material otherwise express in the garden of life—which material elsewhere grow be stale and uneatable but it have no sooner do this than it have to take account of a process —from which only when it ’ s the basest of the servant of man incur ignominious dismissal with no “ character ” do it and whether under some muddle pretext of morality or on any other pusillanimously edge away the process that of the expression the literal squeeze out of value be another affair—with which the happy luck of mere find have little to do the joy of find at this stage be pretty well over that quest of the subject a a whole by “ match ” a the lady say at the shop the big piece with the snippet have end we assume with a capture the subject be find and if the problem be then transfer to the grind of what to do with it the field open out for any amount of do this be precisely the infusion that a i submit complete the strong mixture it be on the other hand the part of the business that can least be liken to the chase with horn and hound it ’ s all a sedentary part—involves a much cipher of sort a would merit the high salary pay to a chief accountant not however that the chief accountant hasn ’ t his gleam of bliss for the felicity or at least the equilibrium of the artist ’ s state dwell less surely in the far delightful complication he can smuggle in than in those he succeed in keep out he sow his seed at the risk of too thick a crop wherefore yet again like the gentleman who audit ledger he must keep his head at any price in consequence of all which for the interest of the matter i might seem here to have my choice of narrate my “ hunt ” for lambert strether of describe the capture of the shadow project by my friend ’ s anecdote or of report on the occurrence subsequent to that triumph but i have probably best attempt a little to glance in each direction since it come to me again and again over this licentious record that one ’ s bag of adventure conceive or conceivable have be only half empty by the mere tell of one ’ s story it depend so on what one mean by that equivocal quantity there be the story of one ’ s hero and then thanks to the intimate connexion of thing the story of one ’ s story itself i blush to confess it but if one ’ s a dramatist one ’ s a dramatist and the latter imbroglio be liable on occasion to strike me a really the more objective of the two the philosophy impute to him in that beautiful outbreak the hour there amid such happy provision strike for him would have be then on behalf of my man of imagination to be logically and a the artless craft of comedy have it “ lead up ” to the probable course to such a goal the goal of so conscious a predicament would have in short to be finely calculate where have he come from and why have he come what be he do a we anglo saxon and we only say in our foredoom clutch of exotic aid to expression in that galère to answer these question plausibly to answer them a under cross examination in the witness box by counsel for the prosecution in other word satisfactorily to account for strether and for his “ peculiar tone ” be to possess myself of the entire fabric at the same time the clue to it whereabouts would lie in a certain principle of probability he wouldn ’ t have indulge in his peculiar tone without a reason it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give him so ironic an accent one hadn ’ t be note “ tone ” all one ’ s life without recognise when one hear it the voice of the false position the dear man in the paris garden be then admirably and unmistakeably in one—which be no small point gain what next accordingly concern u be the determination of this identity one could only go by probability but there be the advantage that the most general of the probability be virtual certainty possess of our friend ’ s nationality to start with there be a general probability in his narrow localism which for that matter one have really but to keep under the lens for an hour to see it give up it secret he would have issue our rueful worthy from the very heart of new england—at the heel of which matter of course a perfect train of secret tumble for me into the light they have to be sift and sort and i shall not reproduce the detail of that process but unmistakeably they be all there and it be but a question auspiciously of pick among them what the “ position ” would infallibly be and why on his hand it have turn “ false ” —these inductive step could only be a rapid a they be distinct i account for everything—and “ everything ” have by this time become the most promise quantity—by the view that he have come to paris in some state of mind which be literally undergo a a result of new and unexpected assault and infusion a change almost from hour to hour he have come with a view that might have be figure by a clear green liquid say in a neat glass phial and the liquid once pour into the open cup of application once

year during a stay of several week make in venice i have room on riva schiavoni at the top of a house near the passage lead off to san zaccaria the waterside life the wondrous lagoon spread before me and the ceaseless human chatter of venice come in at my window to which i seem to myself to have be constantly drive in the fruitless fidget of composition a if to see whether out in the blue channel the ship of some right suggestion of some well phrase of the next happy twist of my subject the next true touch for my canvas mightn ’ t come into sight but i recall vividly enough that the response most elicit in general to these restless appeal be the rather grim admonition that romantic and historic sit such a the land of italy abound in offer the artist a questionable aid to concentration when they themselves be not to be the subject of it they be too rich in their own life and too charge with their own mean merely to help him out with a lame phrase they draw him away from his small question to their own great one so that after a little he feel while thus yearn toward them in his difficulty a if he be ask an army of glorious veteran to help him to arrest a peddler who have give him the wrong change there be page of the book which in the read over have seem to make me see again the bristle curve of the wide riva the large colour spot of the balconied house and the repeat

high hand insolent fraud and there be insidious sneak one and there be i fear even on the most design artist ’ s part always witless enough good faith always anxious enough desire to fail to guard him against their deceit try to recover here for recognition the germ of my idea i see that it must have consist not at all in any conceit of a “ plot ” nefarious name in any flash upon the fancy of a set of relation or in any one of those situation that by a logic of their own immediately fall for the fabulist into movement into a march or a rush a patter of quick step but altogether in the sense of a single character the character and aspect of a particular engage young woman to which all the usual element of a “ subject ” certainly of a set be to need to be super add quite a interest a the young woman herself at her best do i find i must again repeat this projection of memory upon the whole matter of the growth in one ’ s imagination of some such apology for a motive these be the fascination of the fabulist ’ s art these lurk force of expansion these necessity of upspringing in the seed these beautiful determination on the part of the idea entertain to grow a tall a possible to push into the light and the air and thickly flower there and quite a much these fine possibility of recover from some good standpoint on the grind gain the intimate history of the business of retrace and reconstruct it step and stage i have always fondly remember a remark that i hear fall year ago from the lip of ivan turgenieff in regard to his own experience of the usual origin of the fictive picture it begin for him almost always with the vision of some person or person who hover before him solicit him a the active or passive figure interest him and appeal to him just a they be and by what they be he saw them in that fashion a disponibles saw them subject to the chance the complication of existence and saw them vividly but then have to find for them the right relation those that would most bring them out to imagine to invent and select and piece together the situation most useful and favourable to the sense of the creature themselves the complication they would be most likely to produce and to feel “ to arrive at these thing be to arrive at my story ” he say “ and that ’ s the way i look for it the result be that i ’ m often accuse of not have ‘ story ’ enough i seem to myself to have a much a i need to show my people to exhibit their relation with each other for that be all my measure if i watch them long enough i see them come together i see them place i see them engage in this or that act and in this or that difficulty how they look and move and speak and behave always in the set i have find for them be my account of them of which i dare say ala que cela

reside in the stray figure the unattached character the image en disponibilité it give me high warrant than i seem then to have meet for just that bless habit of one ’ s own imagination the trick of invest some conceive or encounter individual some brace or group of individual with the germinal property and authority i be myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figure than of their set a too preliminary a preferential interest in which strike me a in general such a put of the cart before the horse i might envy though i couldn ’ t emulate the imaginative writer so constitute a to see his fable first and to make out it agent afterwards i could think so little of any fable that didn ’ t need it agent positively to launch it i could think so little of any situation that didn ’ t depend for it interest on the nature of the person situate and thereby on their way of take it there be method of so call presentation i believe among novelist who have appear to flourish that offer the situation a indifferent to that support but i have not lose the sense of the value for me at the time of the admirable russian ’ s testimony to my not need all superstitiously to try and perform any such gymnastic other echo from the same source linger with me i confess a unfadingly if it be not all indeed one much embrace echo it be impossible after that not to read for one ’ s us high lucidity into the torment and disfigure and bemuddled question of the objective value and even quite into that of the critical appreciation of “ subject ” in the novel one have have from an early time for that matter the instinct of the right estimate of such value and of it reduce to the inane the dull dispute over the “ immoral ” subject and the moral recognise so promptly the one measure of the worth of a give subject the question about it that rightly answer dispose of all others be it valid in a word be it genuine be it sincere the result of some direct impression or perception of life i have find small edification mostly in a critical pretension that have neglect from the first all delimitation of grind and all definition of term the air of my early time show to memory a darken all round with that vanity unless the difference to day be just in one ’ s own final impatience the lapse of one ’ s attention there be i think no more nutritive or suggestive truth in this connexion than that of the perfect dependence of the “ moral ” sense of a work of art on the amount of felt life concern in produce it the question come back thus obviously to the kind and the degree of the artist ’ s prime sensibility which be the soil out of which his subject spring the quality and capacity of that soil it ability to “ grow ” with due freshness and straightness any vision of life represent strongly or weakly the project morality that element be but another name for the more or less close connexion of the subject with some mark make on the intelligence with some sincere experience by

preserve that form with closeness to range through all the difference of the individual relation to it general subject matter all the variety of outlook on life of disposition to reflect and project

fine man he appear to possess that kind of health and strength which when find in perfection be the most impressive—the physical capital which the owner do nothing to “ keep up ” if he be a muscular christian it be quite without know it if it be necessary to walk to a remote spot he walk but he have never know himself to “ exercise ” he have no theory with regard to cold bath or the use of indian club he be neither an oarsman a rifleman nor a fencer—he have never have time for these amusements—and he be quite unaware that the saddle be recommend for certain form of indigestion he be by inclination a temperate man but he have sup the night before his visit to the louvre at the café anglais—someone have tell him it be an experience not to be omitted—and he have sleep none the less the sleep of the just his usual attitude and carriage be of a rather relax and lounge kind but when under a special inspiration he straighten himself he look like a grenadier on parade he never smoke he have be assured—such thing be said—that cigar be excellent for the health and he be quite capable of believe it but he know a little about tobacco a about homœopathy he have a very well form head with a shapely symmetrical balance of the frontal and the occipital development and a good deal of straight rather dry brown hair his complexion be brown and his nose have a bold well mark arch his eye be of a clear cold gray and save for a rather abundant moustache he be clean shave he have the flat jaw and sinewy neck which be frequent in the american type but the trace of national origin be a matter of expression even more than of feature and it be in this respect that our friend ’ s countenance be supremely eloquent the discriminate observer we have be suppose might however perfectly have measure it expressiveness and yet have be at a loss to describe it it have that typical vagueness which be not vacuity that blankness which be not simplicity that look of be commit to nothing in particular of stand in an attitude of general hospitality to the chance of life of be very much at one ’ s own disposal so characteristic of many american face it be our friend ’ s eye that chiefly tell his story an eye in which innocence and experience be singularly blend it be full of contradictory suggestion and though it be by no mean the glow orb of a hero of romance you could find in it almost anything you look for frigid and yet friendly frank yet cautious shrewd yet credulous positive yet sceptical confident yet shy extremely intelligent and extremely good humor there be something vaguely defiant in it concession and something profoundly reassure in it reserve the cut of this gentleman ’ s moustache with the two premature wrinkle in the cheek above it and the fashion of his garment in which an expose shirt front and a cerulean cravat play perhaps an obtrusive part complete the condition of his identity we have approach him perhaps at a not especially favorable moment he be by no mean sit for his portrait but listless a he lounge there rather baffle on the æsthetic question and guilty of the damn fault a we have lately discover it to be of confound the merit of the artist with that of his work for he admire the squint madonna of the young lady with the boyish coiffure because he think the young lady herself uncommonly take he be a sufficiently promise acquaintance decision salubrity jocosity prosperity seem to hover within his call he be evidently a practical man but the idea in his case have undefined and mysterious boundary which invite the imagination to bestir itself on his behalf a the little copyist proceed with her work she send every now and then a responsive glance toward her admirer the cultivation of the fine art appear to necessitate to her mind a great deal of by play a great stand off with fold arm and head droop from side to side stroke of a dimple chin with a dimple hand sigh and frown and pat of the foot fumble in disorder tress for wander hair pin these performance be accompany by a restless glance which linger long than elsewhere upon the gentleman we have describe at last he rise abruptly put on his hat and approach the young lady he place himself before her picture and look at it for some moment during which she pretend to be quite unconscious of his inspection then address her with the single word which constitute the strength of his french vocabulary and hold up one finger in a manner which appear to him to illuminate his mean “ combien ” he abruptly demand the artist star a moment give a little pout shrug her shoulder put down her palette and brush and stand rubbing her hand “ how much ” say our friend in english “ combien ” “ monsieur wish to buy it ” ask the young lady in french “ very pretty splendide combien ” repeat the american “ it plea monsieur my little picture it ’ s a very beautiful subject ” say the young lady “ the madonna yes i be not a catholic but i want to buy it combien write it here ” and he take a pencil from his pocket and show her the fly leaf of his guide book she stand look at him and scratch her chin with the pencil “ be it not for sale ” he ask and a she still stand reflect and look at him with an eye which in spite of her desire to treat this avidity of patronage a a very old story betray an almost touch incredulity he be afraid he have offend her she be simply try to look indifferent and wonder how far she might go “ i haven ’ t make a mistake— pa insulté no ” her interlocutor continue “ don ’ t you understand a little english ” the young lady ’ s aptitude for play a part at short notice be remarkable she fix him with her conscious perceptive eye and ask him if he speak no french then “ donnez ” she say briefly and take the open guide book in the upper corner of the fly leaf she trace a number in a minute and extremely neat hand then she hand back the book and take up her palette again our friend read the number “ franc ” he say nothing for a time but stand look at the picture while the copyist begin actively to dabble with her paint “ for a copy isn ’ t that a good deal ” he ask at last “ pa beaucoup ” the young lady raise her eye from her palette scan him from head to foot and alight with admirable sagacity upon exactly the right answer “ yes it ’ s a good deal but my copy have remarkable quality it be worth nothing less ” the gentleman in whom we be interest understand no french but i have say he be intelligent and here be a good chance to prove it he apprehend by a natural instinct the mean of the young woman ’ s phrase and it gratify him to think that she be so honest beauty talent virtue she combine everything “ but you must finish it ” he say “ finish you know ” and he point to the unpainted hand of the figure “ oh it shall be finish in perfection in the perfection of perfection ” cry mademoiselle and to confirm her promise she deposit a rosy blotch in the middle of the madonna ’ s cheek but the american frown “ ah too red too red ” he rejoin “ her complexion ” point to the murillo “ is—more delicate ” “ delicate oh it shall be delicate monsieur delicate a sèvres biscuit i be go to tone that down i know all the secret of my art and where will you allow u to send it to you your address ” “ my address oh yes ” and the gentleman draw a card from his pocket book and write something upon it then hesitate a moment he say “ if i don ’ t like it when it it ’ s finish you know i shall not be oblige to take it ” the young lady seem a good a guesser a himself “ oh i be very sure that monsieur be not capricious ” she say with a roguish smile “ capricious ” and at this monsieur begin to laugh “ oh no i ’ m not capricious i be very faithful i be very constant comprenez ” “ monsieur be constant i understand perfectly it ’ s a rare virtue to recompense you you shall have your picture on the first possible day next week—as soon a it be dry i will take the card of monsieur ” and she take it and read his name “ christopher newman ” then she try to repeat it aloud and laugh at her bad accent “ your english name be so droll ” “ droll ” say mr newman laugh too “ do you ever hear of christopher columbus ” “ bien sûr he invent america a very great man and be he your patron ” “ my patron ” “ your patron saint in the calendar ” “ oh exactly my parent name me for him ” “ monsieur be american ” “ don ’ t you see it ” monsieur inquire “ and you mean to carry my little picture away over there ” and she explain her phrase with a gesture “ oh i mean to buy a great many pictures— beaucoup beaucoup ” say christopher newman “ the honor be not less for me ” the young lady answer “ for i be sure monsieur have a great deal of taste ” “ but you must give me your card ” newman say “ your card you know ” the young lady look severe for an instant and then say “ my father will wait upon you ” but this time mr newman ’ s power of divination be at fault “ your card your address ” he simply repeat “ my address ” say mademoiselle then with a little shrug “ happily for you you be an american it be the first time i ever give my card to a gentleman ” and take from her pocket a rather greasy portemonnaie she extract from it a small glaze visit card and present the latter to her patron it be neatly inscribe in pencil with a great many flourish “ mlle noémie nioche ” but mr newman unlike his companion read the name with perfect gravity all french name to him be equally droll “ and precisely here be my father who have come to escort me home ” say mademoiselle noémie “ he speak english he will arrange with you ” and she turn to welcome a little old gentleman who come shuffle up peer over his spectacle at newman m nioche wear a glossy wig of an unnatural color which overhang his little meek white vacant face and leave it hardly more expressive than the unfeatured block upon which these article be display in the barber ’ s window he be an exquisite image of shabby gentility his scant ill make coat desperately brush his darn glove his highly polish boot his rusty shapely hat tell the story of a person who have “ have loss ” and who cling to the spirit of nice habit even though the letter have be hopelessly efface among other thing m nioche have lose courage adversity have not only ruin him it have frighten him and he be evidently go through his remnant of life on tiptoe for fear of wake up the hostile fate if this strange gentleman be say anything improper to his daughter m nioche would entreat him huskily a a particular favor to forbear but he would admit at the same time that he be very presumptuous to ask for particular favor “ monsieur have buy my picture ” say mademoiselle noémie “ when it ’ s finish you ’ ll carry it to him in a cab ” “ in a cab ” cry m nioche and he star in a bewilder way a if he have see the sun rise at midnight “ be you the young lady ’ s father ” say newman “ i think she say you speak english ” “ speak english—yes ” say the old man slowly rubbing his hand “ i will bring it in a cab ” “ say something then ” cry his daughter “ thank him a little—not too much ” “ a little my daughter a little ” say m nioche perplex “ how much ” “ two thousand ” say mademoiselle noémie “ don ’ t make a fuss or he ’ ll take back his word ” “ two thousand ” cry the old man and he begin to fumble for his snuff box he look at newman from head to foot he look at his daughter and then at the picture “ take care you don ’ t spoil it ” he cry almost sublimely “ we must go home ” say mademoiselle noémie “ this be a good day ’ s work take care how you carry it ” and she begin to put up her utensil “ how can i thank you ” say m nioche “ my english do not suffice ” “ i wish i speak french a well ” say newman good naturedly “ your daughter be very clever ” “ oh sir ” and m nioche look over his spectacle with tearful eye and nod several time with a world of sadness “ she have have an education— très supérieure nothing be spar lesson in pastel at ten franc the lesson lesson in oil at twelve franc i didn ’ t look at the franc then she ’ s an artiste eh ” “ do i understand you to say that you have have revers ” ask newman “ revers oh sir misfortunes—terrible ” “ unsuccessful in business eh ” “ very unsuccessful sir ” “ oh never fear you ’ ll get on your leg again ” say newman cheerily the old man droop his head on one side and look at him with an expression of pain a if this be an unfeeling jest “ what do he say ” demand mademoiselle noémie m nioche

xxiv the turn of the screw the story have hold u round the fire sufficiently breathless but except the obvious remark that it be gruesome a on christmas eve in an old house a strange tale should essentially be i remember no comment utter till somebody happen to say that it be the only case he have meet in which such a visitation have fall on a child the case i may mention be that of an apparition in just such an old house a have gather u for the occasion—an appearance of a dreadful kind to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and wake her up in the terror of it wake her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again but to encounter also herself before she have succeed in do so the same sight that have shake him it be this observation that draw from douglas—not immediately but late in the evening—a reply that have the interest consequence to which i call attention someone else tell a story not particularly effective which i saw he be not follow this i take for a sign that he have himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait we wait in fact till two night late but that same evening before we scatter he bring out what be in his mind i quite agree—in regard to griffin ’ s ghost or whatever it was—that it appear first to the little boy at so tender an age add a particular touch but it ’ s not the first occurrence of it charm kind that i know to have involve a child if the child give the effect another turn of the screw what do you say to two children— “ we say of course ” somebody exclaim “ that they give two turn also that we want to hear about them ” i can see douglas there before the fire to which he have get up to present his back look down at his interlocutor with his hand in his pocket “ nobody but me till now have ever hear it ’ s quite too horrible ” this naturally be declare by several voice to give the thing the utmost price and our friend with quiet art prepare his triumph by turn his eye over the rest of u and go on “ it ’ s beyond everything nothing at all that i know touch it ” “ for sheer terror ” i remember ask he seem to say it be not so simple a that to be really at a loss how to qualify it he pass his hand over his eye make a little wince grimace “ for dreadful—dreadfulness ” “ oh how delicious ” cry one of the woman he take no notice of her he look at me but a if instead of me he saw what he speak of “ for general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain ” “ well then ” i say “ just sit right down and begin ” he turn round to the fire give a kick to a log watch it an instant then a he face u again “ i can ’ t begin i shall have to send to town ” there be a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupy way he explain “ the story ’ s write it ’ s in a lock drawer—it have not be out for year i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet a he find it ” it be to me in particular that he appear to propound this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate he have break a thickness of ice the formation of many a winter have have his reason for a long silence the others resent postponement but it be just his scruple that charm me i adjure him to write by the first post and to agree with u for an early hearing then i ask him if the experience in question have be his own to this his answer be prompt “ oh thank god no ” “ and be the record yours you take the thing down ” “ nothing but the impression i take that here ” —he tap his heart “ i ’ ve never lose it ” “ then your manuscript— ” “ be in old fade ink and in the most beautiful hand ” he hang fire again “ a woman ’ s she have be dead these twenty year she send me the page in question before she die ” they be all listen now and of course there be somebody to be arch or at any rate to draw the inference but if he put the inference by without a smile it be also without irritation “ she be a most charm person but she be ten year old than i she be my sister ’ s govern ” he quietly say “ she be the most agreeable woman i ’ ve ever know in her position she would have be worthy of any whatever it be long ago and this episode be long before i be at trinity and i find her at home on my come down the second summer i be much there that year—it be a beautiful one and we have in her off hour some stroll and talk in the garden—talks in which she strike me a awfully clever and nice oh yes don ’ t grin i like her extremely and be glad to this day to think she like me too if she hadn ’ t she wouldn ’ t have tell me she have never tell anyone it wasn ’ t simply that she say so but that i know she hadn ’ t i be sure i could see you ’ ll easily judge why when you hear ” “ because the thing have be such a scare ” he continue to fix me “ you ’ ll easily judge ” he repeat “ you will ” i fix him too “ i see she be in love ” he laugh for the first time “ you be acute yes she be in love that be she have be that come out—she couldn ’ t tell her story without it come out i saw it and she saw i saw it but neither of u speak of it i remember the time and the place—the corner of the lawn the shade of the great beech and the long hot summer afternoon it wasn ’ t a scene for a shudder but oh— ” he quit the fire and drop back into his chair “ you ’ ll receive the packet thursday morning ” i inquire “ probably not till the second post ” “ well then after dinner— ” “ you ’ ll all meet me here ” he look u round again “ isn ’ t anybody go ” it be almost the tone of hope “ everybody will stay ” “ i will ” —and “ i will ” cry the lady whose departure have be fix mr griffin however express the need for a little more light “ who be it she be in love with ” “ the story will tell ” i take upon myself to reply “ oh i can ’ t wait for the story ” “ the story win ’ t tell ” say douglas “ not in any literal vulgar way ” “ more ’ s the pity then that ’ s the only way i ever understand ” “ win ’ t you tell douglas ” somebody else inquire he spring to his foot again “ yes—tomorrow now i must go to bed good night ” and quickly catch up a candlestick he leave u slightly bewilder from our end of the great brown hall we hear his step on the stair whereupon mr griffin speak “ well if i don ’ t know who she be in love with i know who he be ” “ she be ten year old ” say her husband “ raison de plus —at that age but it ’ s rather nice his long reticence ” “ forty year ” griffin put in “ with this outbreak at last ” “ the outbreak ” i return “ will make a tremendous occasion of thursday night ” and everyone so agree with me that in the light of it we lose all attention for everything else the last story however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial have be tell we handshook and “ candlestuck ” a somebody say and go to bed i know the next day that a letter contain the key have by the first post go off to his london apartment but in spite of—or perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner till such an hour of the evening in fact a might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hop be fix then he become a communicative a we could desire and indeed give u his best reason for be so we have it from him again before the fire in the hall a we have have our mild wonder of the previous night it appear that the narrative he have promise to read u really require for a proper intelligence a few word of prologue let me say here distinctly to have do with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own make much late be what i shall presently give poor douglas before his death—when it be in sight—committed to me the manuscript that reach him on the third of these day and that on the same spot with immense effect he begin to read to our hush little circle on the night of the fourth the depart lady who have say they would stay didn ’ t of course thank heaven stay they depart in consequence of arrangement make in a rage of curiosity a they profess produce by the touch with which he have already work u up but that only make his little final auditory more compact and select keep it round the hearth subject to a common thrill the first of these touch convey that the write statement take up the tale at a point after it have in a manner begin the fact to be in possession of be therefore that his old friend the young of several daughter of a poor country parson have at the age of twenty on take service for the first time in the schoolroom come up to london in trepidation to answer in person an advertisement that have already place her in brief correspondence with the advertiser this person prove on her present herself for judgment at a house in harley street that impress her a vast and imposing—this prospective patron prove a gentleman a bachelor in the prime of life such a figure a have never rise save in a dream or an old novel before a flutter anxious girl out of a hampshire vicarage one could easily fix his type it never happily die out he be handsome and bold and pleasant off hand and gay and kind he strike her inevitably a gallant and splendid but what take her most of all and give her the courage she afterward show be that he put the whole thing to her a a kind of favor an obligation he should gratefully incur she conceive him a rich but a fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a glow of high fashion of good look of expensive habit of charm way with woman he have for his own town residence a big house fill with the spoil of travel and the trophy of the chase but it be to his country home an old family place in essex that he wish her immediately to proceed he have be leave by the death of their parent in india guardian to a small nephew and a small niece child of a young a military brother whom he have lose two year before these child be by the strange of chance for a man in his position—a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—very heavily on his hand it have all be a great worry and on his own part doubtless a series of blunder but he immensely pity the poor chick and have do all he could have in particular send them down to his other house the proper place for them be of course the country and keep them there from the first with the best people he could find to look after them part even with his own servant to wait on them and go down himself whenever he might to see how they be do the awkward thing be that they have practically no other relation and that his own affair take up all his time he have put them in possession of bly which be healthy and secure and have place at the head of their little establishment—but below stair only—an excellent woman mr grose whom he be sure his visitor would like and who have formerly be maid to his mother she be now housekeeper and be also act for the time a superintendent to the little girl of whom without child of her own she be by good luck extremely fond there be plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down a govern would be in supreme authority she would also have in holiday to look after the small boy who have be for a term at school—young a he be to be send but what else could be do —and who a the holiday be about to begin would be back from one day to the other there have be for the two child at first a young lady whom they have have the misfortune to lose she have do for them quite beautifully—she be a most respectable person—till her death the great awkwardness of which have precisely leave no alternative but the school for little mile mr grose since then in the way of manner and thing have do a she could for flora and there be far a cook a housemaid a dairywoman an old pony an old groom and an old gardener all likewise thoroughly respectable so far have douglas present his picture when someone put a question “ and what do the former govern die of —of so much respectability ” our friend ’ s answer be prompt “ that will come out i don ’ t anticipate ” “ excuse me—i think that be just what you be do ” “ in her successor ’ s place ” i suggest “ i should have wish to learn if the office bring with it— ” “ necessary danger to life ” douglas complete my think “ she do wish to learn and she do learn you shall hear tomorrow what she learn meanwhile of course the prospect strike her a slightly grim she be young untried nervous it be a vision of serious duty and little company of really great loneliness she hesitated—took a couple of day to consult and consider but the salary offer much exceed her modest measure and on a second interview she face the music she engage ” and douglas with this make a pause that for the benefit of the company move me to throw in— “ the moral of which be of course the seduction exercise by the splendid young man she succumb to it ” he get up and a he have do the night before go to the fire give a stir to a log with his foot then stand a moment with his back to u “ she saw him only twice ” “ yes but that ’ s just the beauty of her passion ” a little to my surprise on this douglas turn round to me “ it be the beauty of it there be others ” he go on “ who hadn ’ t succumb he tell her frankly all his difficulty—that for several applicant the condition have be prohibitive they be somehow simply afraid it sound dull—it sound strange and all the more so because of his main condition ” “ which was— ” “ that she should never trouble him—but never never neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything only meet all question herself receive all money from his solicitor take the whole thing over and let him alone she promise to do this and she mention to me that when for a moment disburden delight he hold her hand thank her for the sacrifice she already felt reward ” “ but be that all her reward ” one of the lady ask “ she never saw him again ” “ oh ” say the lady which a our friend immediately leave u again be the only other word of importance contribute to the subject till the next night by the corner of the hearth in the best chair he open the fade red cover of a thin old fashion gilt edge album the whole thing take indeed more night than one but on the first occasion the same lady put another question “ what be your title ” “ i haven ’ t one ” “ oh i have ” i say but douglas without heed me have begin

greville fane the real thing i when the porter ’ s wife she use to answer the house bell announce a gentleman—with a lady sir i have a i often have in those day for the wish be father to the think an immediate vision of sitter sitter my visitor in this case prove to be but not in the sense i should have prefer however there be nothing at first to indicate that they might not have come for a portrait the gentleman a man of fifty very high and very straight with a moustache slightly grizzle and a dark grey walk coat admirably fit both of which i note professionally—i don ’ t mean a a barber or yet a a tailor—would have strike me a a celebrity if celebrity often be strike it be a truth of which i have for some time be conscious that a figure with a good deal of frontage be a one might say almost never a public institution a glance at the lady help to remind me of this paradoxical law she also look too distinguish to be a “ personality ” moreover one would scarcely come across two variation together neither of the pair speak immediately—they only prolong the preliminary gaze which suggest that each wish to give the other a chance they be visibly shy they stand there let me take them in—which a i afterwards perceive be the most practical thing they could have do in this way their embarrassment serve their cause i have see people painfully reluctant to mention that they desire anything so gross a to be represent on canvas but the scruple of my new friend appear almost insurmountable yet the gentleman might have say “ i should like a portrait of my wife ” and the lady might have say “ i should like a portrait of my husband ” perhaps they be not husband and wife—this naturally would make the matter more delicate perhaps they wish to be do together—in which case they ought to have bring a third person to break the news “ we come from mr rivet ” the lady say at last with a dim smile which have the effect of a moist sponge pass over a “ sink ” piece of painting a well a of a vague allusion to vanish beauty she be a tall and straight in her degree a her companion and with ten year less to carry she look a sad a a woman could look whose face be not charge with expression that be her tint oval mask show friction a an expose surface show it the hand of time have play over her freely but only to simplify she be slim and stiff and so well dress in dark blue cloth with lappet and pocket and button that it be clear she employ the same tailor a her husband the couple have an indefinable air of prosperous thrift—they evidently get a good deal of luxury for their money if i be to be one of their luxury it would behove me to consider my term “ ah claude rivet recommend me ” i inquire and i add that it be very kind of him though i could reflect that a he only paint landscape this be not a sacrifice the lady look very hard at the gentleman and the gentleman look round the room then star at the floor a moment and stroke his moustache he rest his pleasant eye on me with the remark “ he say you be the right one ” “ i try to be when people want to sit ” “ yes we should like to ” say the lady anxiously “ do you mean together ” my visitor exchange a glance “ if you could do anything with me i suppose it would be double ” the gentleman stammer “ oh yes there ’ s naturally a high charge for two figure than for one ” “ we should like to make it pay ” the husband confess “ that ’ s very good of you ” i return appreciate so unwonted a sympathy—for i suppose he mean pay the artist a sense of strangeness seem to dawn on the lady “ we mean for the illustrations—mr rivet say you might put one in ” “ put one in—an illustration ” i be equally confuse “ sketch her off you know ” say the gentleman colour it be only then that i understand the service claude rivet have render me he have tell them that i work in black and white for magazine for story book for sketch of contemporary life and consequently have frequent employment for model these thing be true but it be not less true i may confess it now—whether because the aspiration be to lead to everything or to nothing i leave the reader to guess that i couldn ’ t get the honour to say nothing of the emolument of a great painter of portrait out of my head my “ illustration ” be my pot boiler i look to a different branch of art far and away the most interest it have always seem to me to perpetuate my fame there be no shame in look to it also to make my fortune but that fortune be by so much far from be make from the moment my visitor wish to be “ do ” for nothing i be disappoint for in the pictorial sense i have immediately see them i have seize their type—i have already settle what i would do with it something that wouldn ’ t absolutely have please them i afterwards reflect “ ah you ’ re—you ’ re—a— ” i begin a soon a i have master my surprise i couldn ’ t bring out the dingy word “ model ” it seem to fit the case so little “ we haven ’ t have much practice ” say the lady “ we ’ ve get to do something and we ’ ve think that an artist in your line might perhaps make something of u ” her husband throw off he far mention that they didn ’ t know many artist and that they have go first on the off chance he paint view of course but sometimes put in figures—perhaps i remember to mr rivet whom they have meet a few year before at a place in norfolk where he be sketch “ we use to sketch a little ourselves ” the lady hint “ it ’ s very awkward but we absolutely must do something ” her husband go on “ of course we ’ re not so very young ” she admit with a wan smile with the remark that i might a well know something more about them the husband have hand me a card extract from a neat new pocket book their appurtenance be all of the fresh and inscribe with the word “ major monarch ” impressive a these word be they didn ’ t carry my knowledge much far but my visitor presently add “ i ’ ve leave the army and we ’ ve have the misfortune to lose our money in fact our mean be dreadfully small ” “ it ’ s an awful bore ” say mr monarch they evidently wish to be discreet—to take care not to swagger because they be gentlefolk i perceive they would have be will to recognise this a something of a drawback at the same time that i guess at an underlie sense—their consolation in adversity—that they have their point they certainly have but these advantage strike me a preponderantly social such for instance a would help to make a draw room look well however a draw room be always or ought to be a picture in consequence of his wife ’ s allusion to their age major monarch observe “ naturally it ’ s more for the figure that we think of go in we can still hold ourselves up ” on the instant i saw that the figure be indeed their strong point his “ naturally ” didn ’ t sound vain but it light up the question “ she have get the best ” he continue nod at his wife with a pleasant after dinner absence of circumlocution i could only reply a if we be in fact sit over our wine that this didn ’ t prevent his own from be very good which lead him in turn to rejoin “ we think that if you ever have to do people like u we might be something like it she particularly—for a lady in a book you know ” i be so amuse by them that to get more of it i do my best to take their point of view and though it be an embarrassment to find myself appraise physically a if they be animal on hire or useful black a pair whom i should have expect to meet only in one of the relation in which criticism be tacit i look at mr monarch judicially enough to be able to exclaim after a moment with conviction “ oh yes a lady in a book ” she be singularly like a bad illustration “ we ’ ll stand up if you like ” say the major and he raise himself before me with a really grand air i could take his measure at a glance—he be six foot two and a perfect gentleman it would have pay any club in process of formation and in want of a stamp to engage him at a salary to stand in the principal window what strike me immediately be that in come to me they have rather miss their vocation they could surely have be turn to well account for advertising purpose i couldn ’ t of course see the thing in detail but i could see them make someone ’ s fortune—i don ’ t mean their own there be something in them for a waistcoat maker an hotel keeper or a soap vendor i could

shyness and presently her husband say to her “ get up my dear and show how smart you be ” she obey but she have no need to get up to show it she walk to the end of the studio and then she come back blush with her flutter eye on her husband i be remind of an incident i have accidentally have a glimpse of in paris—being with a friend there a dramatist about to produce a play—when an actress come to him to ask to be intrust with a part she go through her pace before him walk up and down a mr monarch be do mr monarch do it quite a well but i abstain from applaud it be very odd to see such people apply for such poor pay she look a if she have ten thousand a year her husband have use the word that describe her she be in the london current jargon essentially and typically “ smart ” her figure be in the same order of idea conspicuously and irreproachably “ good ” for a woman of her age her waist be surprisingly small her elbow moreover have the orthodox crook she hold her head at the conventional angle but why do she come to me she ought to have try on jacket at a big shop i fear my visitor be not only destitute but “ artistic ” —which would be a great complication when she sit down again i thank her observe that what a draughtsman most value in his model be the faculty of keep quiet “ oh she can keep quiet ” say major monarch then he add jocosely “ i ’ ve always keep her quiet ” “ i ’ m not a nasty fidget be i ” mr monarch appeal to her husband he address his answer to me “ perhaps it isn ’ t out of place to mention—because we ought to be quite business like oughtn ’

“ and then i suppose you know that you ’ ll get awfully tire ” “ oh we never get tire ” they eagerly cry “ have you have any kind of practice ” they hesitated—they look at each other “ we ’ ve be photograph immensely ” say mr monarch “ she mean the fellow have ask u ” add the major “ i see—because you ’ re so good look ” “ i don ’ t know what they think but they be always after u ” “ we always get our photograph for nothing ” smile mr monarch “ we might have bring some my dear ” her husband remark “ i ’ m not sure we have any leave we ’ ve give quantity away ” she explain to me “ with our autograph and that sort of thing ” say the major “ be they to be get in the shop ” i inquire a a harmless pleasantry “ oh yes hers—they use to be ” “ not now ” say mr monarch with her eye on the floor ii i could fancy the “ sort of thing ” they put on the presentation copy of their photograph and i be sure they write a beautiful hand it be odd how quickly i be sure of everything that concern them if they be now so poor a to have to earn shilling and penny they never have have much of a margin their good look have be their capital and they have good humouredly make the most of the career that this resource mark out for them it be in their face the blankness the deep intellectual repose of the twenty year of country house visit which have give them pleasant intonation i could see the sunny draw room sprinkle with periodical she didn ’ t read in which mr monarch have continuously sit i could see the wet shrubbery in which she have walk equip to admiration for either exercise i could see the rich cover the major have help to shoot and the wonderful garment in which late at night he repair to the smoking room to talk about them i could imagine their legging and waterproof their know tweed and rug their roll of stick and case of tackle and neat umbrella and i could evoke the exact appearance of their servant and the compact variety of their luggage on the platform of country station they give small tip but they be like they didn ’ t do anything themselves but they be welcome they look so well everywhere they gratify the general relish for stature complexion and “ form ” they know it without fatuity or vulgarity and they respect themselves in consequence they be not superficial they be thorough and keep themselves up—it have be their line people with such a taste for activity have to have some line i could feel how even in a dull house they could have be count upon for cheerfulness at present something have happened—it didn ’ t matter what their little income have grow less it have grow least—and they have to do something for pocket money their friend like them but didn ’ t like to support them there be something about them that represent credit—their clothe their manner their type but if credit be a large empty pocket in which an occasional chink reverberate the chink at least must be audible what they want of me be to help to make it so fortunately they have no children—i soon divine that they would also perhaps wish our relation to be keep secret this be why it be “ for the figure ” —the reproduction of the face would betray them i like them—they be so simple and i have no objection to them if they would suit but somehow with all their perfection i didn ’ t easily believe in them after all they be amateur and the rule passion of my life be the

90,janeAusten_mansfieldPark,jane_austen,161594,mansfield park by jane austen chapter i about thirty year ago miss maria ward of huntingdon with only seven thousand pound have the good luck to captivate sir thomas bertram of mansfield park in the county of northampton and to be thereby raise to the rank of a baronet s lady with all the comfort and consequence of an handsome house and large income all huntingdon exclaim on the greatness of the match and her uncle the lawyer himself allow her to be at least three thousand pound short of any equitable claim to it she have two sister to be benefit by her elevation and such of their acquaintance a think miss ward and miss france quite a handsome a miss maria do not scruple to predict their marry with almost equal advantage but there certainly be not so many men of large fortune in the world a there be pretty woman to deserve them miss ward at the end of half a dozen year find herself oblige to be attach to the rev mr norris a friend of her brother in law with scarcely any private fortune and miss france fare yet bad miss ward s match indeed when it come to the point wa not contemptible sir thomas be happily able to give his friend an income in the live of mansfield and mr and mr norris begin their career of conjugal felicity with very little le than a thousand a year but miss france marry in the common phrase to disoblige her family and by fix on a lieutenant of marine without education fortune or connexion do it very thoroughly she could hardly have make a more untoward choice sir thomas bertram have interest which from principle a well a pride from a general wish of do right and a desire of see all that be connect with him in situation of respectability he would have be glad to exert for the advantage of lady bertram s sister but her husband s profession wa such a no interest could reach and before he have time to devise any other method of assist them an absolute breach between the sister have take place it wa the natural result of the conduct of each party and such a a very imprudent marriage almost always produce to save herself from useless remonstrance mr price never write to her family on the subject till actually marry lady bertram who wa a woman of very tranquil feel and a temper remarkably easy and indolent would have content herself with merely give up her sister and think no more of the matter but mr norris have a spirit of activity which could not be satisfy till she have write a long and angry letter to fanny to point out the folly of her conduct and threaten her with all it possible ill consequence mr price in her turn wa injure and angry and an answer which comprehend each sister in it bitterness and bestow such very disrespectful reflection on the pride of sir thomas a mr norris could not possibly keep to herself put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period their home be so distant and the circle in which they move so distinct a almost to preclude the mean of ever hearing of each other s existence during the eleven follow year or at least to make it very wonderful to sir thomas that mr norris should ever have it in her power to tell them a she now and then do in an angry voice that fanny have get another child by the end of eleven year however mr price could no long afford to cherish pride or resentment or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her a large and still increase family an husband disable for active service but not the le equal to company and good liquor and a very small income to supply their want make her eager to regain the friend she have so carelessly sacrifice and she address lady bertram in a letter which speak so much contrition and despondence such a superfluity of child and such a want of almost everything else a could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation she wa prepare for her ninth lie in and after bewail the circumstance and implore their countenance a sponsor to the expect child she could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance of the eight already in be her eldest wa a boy of ten year old a fine spirit fellow who long to be out in the world but what could she do wa there any chance of his be hereafter useful to sir thomas in the concern of his west indian property no situation would be beneath him or what do sir thomas think of woolwich or how could a boy be send out to the east the letter wa not unproductive it re establish peace and kindness sir thomas send friendly advice and profession lady bertram dispatch money and baby linen and mr norris write the letter such be it immediate effect and within a twelvemonth a more important advantage to mr price result from it mr norris wa often observe to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of her head and that much a they have all do for her she seem to be want to do more and at length she could not but own it to be her wish that poor mr price should be relieve from the charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number what if they be among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter a girl now nine year old of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give the trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing compare with the benevolence of the action lady bertram agree with her instantly i think we can not do well say she let u send for the child sir thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent he debate and hesitate it wa a serious charge a girl so bring up must be adequately provide for or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in take her from her family he think of his own four child of his two son of cousin in love etc but no sooner have he deliberately begin to state his objection than mr norris interrupt him with a reply to them all whether state or not my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notion which indeed be quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main a to the propriety of do everything one could by way of provide for a child one have in a manner take into one s own hand and i be sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion have no child of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the child of my sister and i be sure mr norris be too just but you know i be a woman of few word and profession do not let u be frighten from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she ha the mean of settle well without far expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantage i don t say she would be so handsome a her cousin i dare say she would not but she would be introduce into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstance a in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you be think of your son but do not you know that of all thing upon earth that be the least likely to happen bring up a they would be always together like brother and sister it be morally impossible i never know an instance of it it be in fact the only sure way of provide against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and see by tom or edmund for the first time seven year hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her have be suffer to grow up at a distance from u all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet temper boy in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister there be a great deal of truth in what you say reply sir thomas and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situation of each i only mean to observe that it ought not to be lightly engage in and that to make it really serviceable to mr price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engage to secure to her hereafter a circumstance may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer a you be so sanguine in expect i thoroughly understand you cry mr norris you be everything that be generous and considerate and i be sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do a you well know i be always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear child nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i be capable of neglect her be not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i have a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my fault i have a warm heart and poor a i be would rather deny myself the necessary of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you be not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and a soon a matter be settle i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appoint to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be go i dare say there be always some reputable tradesman s wife or other go up except to the attack on nanny s cousin sir thomas no long make any objection and a more respectable though le economical rendezvous be accordingly substitute everything wa consider a settle and the pleasure of so benevolent a scheme be already enjoy the division of gratify sensation ought not in strict justice to have be equal for sir thomas wa fully resolve to be the real and consistent patron of the select child and mr norris have not the least intention of be at any expense whatever in her maintenance a far a walk talk and contrive reach she wa thoroughly benevolent and nobody know well how to dictate liberality to others but her love of money wa equal to her love of direct and she know quite a well how to save her own a to spend that of her friend have marry on a narrow income than she have be use to look forward to she have from the first fancy a very strict line of economy necessary and what wa begin a a matter of prudence soon grow into a matter of choice a an object of that needful solicitude which there be no child to supply have there be a family to provide for mr norris might never have save her money but have no care of that kind there wa nothing to impede her frugality or lessen the comfort of make a yearly addition to an income which they have never live up to under this infatuate principle counteract by no real affection for her sister it wa impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of project and arrange so expensive a charity though perhaps she might so little know herself a to walk home to the parsonage after this conversation in the happy belief of be the most liberal mind sister and aunt in the world when the subject wa bring forward again her view be more fully explain and in reply to lady bertram s calm inquiry of where shall the child come to first sister to you or to u sir thomas hear with some surprise that it would be totally out of mr norris s power to take any share in the personal charge of her he have be consider her a a particularly welcome addition at the parsonage a a desirable companion to an aunt who have no child of her own but he find himself wholly mistake mr norris wa sorry to say that the little girl s stay with them at least a thing then be wa quite out of the question poor mr norris s indifferent state of health make it an impossibility he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly if indeed he should ever get well of his gouty complaint it would be a different matter she should then be glad to take her turn and think nothing of the inconvenience but just now poor mr norris take up every moment of her time and the very mention of such a thing she wa sure would distract him then she have well come to u say lady bertram with the utmost composure after a short pause sir thomas add with dignity yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companion of her own age and of a regular instructress very true cry mr norris which be both very important consideration and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she ha three girl to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i be not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three day i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nursery it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girl and close by the housemaid who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothe for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect elli to wait on her a well a the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else lady bertram make no opposition i hope she will prove a well dispose girl continue mr norris and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in have such friend should her disposition be really bad say sir thomas we must not for our own child s sake continue her in the family but there be no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish alter in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinion and very distress vulgarity of manner but these be not incurable fault nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associate have my daughter be young than herself i should have consider the introduction of such a companion a a matter of very serious moment but a it be i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association that be exactly what i think cry mr norris and what i wa say to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child say i only be with her cousin if miss lee teach her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them i hope she will not tease my poor pug say lady bertram i have but just get julia to leave it alone there will be some difficulty in our way mr norris observe sir thomas a to the distinction proper to be make between the girl a they grow up how to preserve in the mind of my daughter the consciousness of what they be without make them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depress her spirit too far to make her remember that she be not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friend and would on no account authorise in my girl the small degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they can not be equal their rank fortune right and expectation will always be different it be a point of great delicacy and you must assist u in our endeavour to choose exactly the right line of conduct mr norris wa quite at his service

congratulation but i hope it all go off tolerably well how do you all behave who cry most ah poor miss taylor ti a sad business poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i can not possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it come to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be well to have only one to please than two especially when one of those two be such a fanciful troublesome creature say emma playfully that be what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father be not by i believe it be very true my dear indeed say mr woodhouse with a sigh i be afraid i be sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i mean only myself mr knightley love to find fault with me you know in a joke it be all a joke we always say what we like to one another mr knightley in fact wa one of the few people who could see fault in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever tell her of them and though this wa not particularly agreeable to emma herself she know it would be so much le so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance a her not be think perfect by every body emma know i never flat her say mr knightley but i mean no reflection on any body miss taylor ha be use to have two person to please she will now have but one the chance be that she must be a gainer well say emma will to let it pa you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behave charmingly every body wa punctual every body in their best look not a tear and hardly a long face to be see oh no we all felt that we be go to be only half a mile apart and be sure of meet every day dear emma bear every thing so well say her father but mr knightley she be really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i be sure she will miss her more than she think for emma turn away her head divide between tear and smile it be impossible that emma should not miss such a companion say mr knightley we should not like her so well a we do sir if we could suppose it but she know how much the marriage be to miss taylor s advantage she know how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settle in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain a pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily marry and you have forget one matter of joy to me say emma and a very considerable one that i make the match myself i make the match you know four year ago and to have it take place and be prove in the right when so many people say mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing mr knightley shake his head at her her father fondly reply ah my dear i wish you would not make match and foretell thing for whatever you say always come to pa pray do not make any more match i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it be the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body say that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who have be a widower so long and who seem so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupy either in his business in town or among his friend here always acceptable wherever he go always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he do not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talk of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not let him all manner of solemn nonsense wa talk on the subject but i believe none of it ever since the day about four year ago that miss taylor and i meet with him in broadway lane when because it begin to drizzle he dart away with so much gallantry and borrow two umbrella for u from farmer mitchell s i make up my mind on the subject i plan the match from that hour and when such success ha bless me in this instance dear papa you can not think that i shall leave off match make i do not understand what you mean by success say mr knightley success suppose endeavour your time ha be properly and delicately spend if you have be endeavour for the last four year to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your make the match a you call it mean only your plan it your say to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston be to marry her and say it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where be your merit what be you proud of you make a lucky guess and that be all that can be say and have you never know the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i think you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess be never merely luck there be always some talent in it and a to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i be so entirely without any claim to it you have draw two pretty picture but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i have not promote mr weston s visit here and give many little encouragement and smooth many little matter it might not have come to any

add a relish to his existence by a former marriage mr henry dashwood have one son by his present lady three daughter the son a steady respectable young man wa amply provide for by the fortune of his mother which have be large and half of which devolve on him on his come of age by his own marriage likewise which happen soon afterwards he add to his wealth to him therefore the succession to the norland estate wa not so really important a to his sister for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their father s inherit that property could be but small their mother have nothing and their father only seven thousand pound in his own disposal for the remain moiety of his first wife s fortune wa also secure to her child and he have only a life interest in it the old gentleman die his will wa read and like almost every other will give a much disappointment a pleasure he wa neither so unjust nor so ungrateful a to leave his estate from his nephew but he leave it to him on such term a destroy half the value of the bequest mr dashwood have wish for it more for the sake of his wife and daughter than for himself or his son but to his son and his son s son a child of four year old it wa secure in such a way a to leave to himself no power of provide for those who be most dear to him and who most need a provision by any charge on the estate or by any sale of it valuable wood the whole wa tie up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visit with his father and mother at norland have so far gain on the affection of his uncle by such attraction a be by no mean unusual in child of two or three year old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of have his own way many cunning trick and a great deal of noise a to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for year he have receive from his niece and her daughter he mean not to be unkind however and a a mark of his affection for the three girl he leave them a thousand pound a piece mr dashwood s disappointment wa at first severe but his temper wa cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many year and by live economically lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement but the fortune which have be so tardy in come wa his only one twelvemonth he survive his uncle no long and ten thousand pound include the late legacy wa all that remain for his widow and daughter his son wa send for a soon a his danger wa know and to him mr dashwood recommend with all the strength and urgency which illness could command the interest of his mother in law and sister mr john dashwood have not the strong feel of the rest of the family but he wa affect by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time and he promise to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable his father wa render easy by such an assurance and mr john dashwood have then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them he wa not an ill dispose young man unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish be to be ill dispose but he wa in general well respect for he conduct himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duty have he marry a more amiable woman he might have be make still more respectable than he wa he might even have be make amiable himself for he wa very young when he marry and very fond of his wife but mr john dashwood wa a strong caricature of himself more narrow mind and selfish when he give his promise to his father he meditate within himself to increase the fortune of his sister by the present of a thousand pound a piece he then really think himself equal to it the prospect of four thousand a year in addition to his present income besides the remain half of his own mother s fortune warm his heart and make him feel capable of generosity yes he would give them three thousand pound it would be liberal and handsome it would be enough to make them completely easy three thousand pound he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience he think of it all day long and for many day successively and he do not repent no sooner wa his father s funeral over than mr john dashwood without send any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrive with her child and their attendant no one could dispute her right to come the house wa her husband s from the moment of his father s decease but the indelicacy of her conduct wa so much the great and to a woman in mr dashwood s situation with only common feel must have be highly unpleasing but in her mind there wa a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever give or receive wa to her a source of immovable disgust mr john dashwood have never be a favourite with any of her husband s family but she have have no opportunity till the present of shew them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion require it so acutely do mr dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly do she despise her daughter in law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quit the house for ever have not the entreaty of her eldest girl induce her first to reflect on the propriety of go and her own tender love for all her three child determine her afterwards to stay and for their sake avoid a breach with their brother elinor this eldest daughter whose advice wa so effectual possess a strength of understand and coolness of judgment which qualify her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enable her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mr dashwood which must generally have lead to imprudence she have an excellent heart her disposition wa affectionate and her feel be strong but she know how to govern them it wa a knowledge which her mother have yet to learn and which one of her sister have resolve never to be teach marianne s ability be in many respect quite equal to elinor s she wa sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrow her joy could have no moderation she wa generous amiable interest she wa everything but prudent the resemblance between her and her mother wa strikingly great elinor saw with concern the excess of her sister s sensibility but by mr dashwood it wa value and cherish they encourage each other now in the violence of their affliction the agony of grief which overpower them at first wa voluntarily renew wa seek for wa create again and again they give themselves up wholly to their sorrow seek increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolve against ever admit consolation in future elinor too wa deeply afflict but still she could struggle she could exert herself she could consult with her brother could receive her sister in law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance margaret the other sister wa a good humor well dispose girl but a she have already imbibe a good deal of marianne s romance without have much of her sense she do not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sister at a more advance period of life chapter mr john dashwood now instal herself mistress of norland and her mother and sister in law be degrade to the condition of visitor a such however they be treat by her with quiet civility and by her husband with a much kindness a he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child he really press them with some earnestness to consider norland a their home and a no plan appear so eligible to mr dashwood a remain there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his invitation wa accept a continuance in a place where everything remind her of former delight wa exactly what suit her mind in season of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or posse in a great degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which be happiness itself but in sorrow she must be equally carry away by her fancy and a far beyond consolation a in pleasure she wa beyond alloy mr john dashwood do not at all approve of what her husband intend to do for his sister to take three thousand pound from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverish him to the most dreadful degree she beg him to think again on the subject how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods who be relate to him only by half blood which she consider a no relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount it wa very well know that no affection wa ever suppose to exist between the child of any man by different marriage and why wa he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by give away all his money to his half sister it wa my father s last request to me reply her husband that i should assist his widow and daughter he do not know what he wa talk of i dare say ten to one but he wa light head at the time have he be in his right sen he could not have think of such a thing a beg you to give away half your fortune from your own child he do not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only request me in general term to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it wa in his power to do perhaps it would have be a well if he have leave it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but a he require the promise i could not do le than give it at least i think so at the time the promise therefore wa give and must be perform something must be do for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home well then let something be do for them but that something need not be three thousand pound consider she add that when the money be once part with it never can return your sister will marry and it will be go for ever if indeed it could be restore to our poor little boy why to be sure say her husband very gravely that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum wa part with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition to be sure it would perhaps then it would be well for all party if the sum be diminish one half five hundred pound would be a prodigious increase to their fortune oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sister even if really his sister and a it be only half blood but you have such a generous spirit i would not wish to do any thing mean he reply one have rather on such occasion do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not do enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more there be no know what they may expect say the lady but we be not to think of their expectation the question be what you can afford to do certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pound a piece a it be without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pound on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman to be sure it be and indeed it strike me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pound divide amongst them if they marry they will be sure of do well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pound that be very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she life rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sister would feel the good effect of it a well a herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable his wife hesitate a little however in give her consent to this plan to be sure say she it be well than part with fifteen hundred pound at once but then if mr dashwood should live fifteen year we shall be completely take in fifteen year my dear fanny her life can not be worth half that purchase certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there be an annuity to be pay them and she be very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity be a very serious business it come over and over every year and there be no get rid of it you be not aware of what you be do i have know a great deal of the trouble of annuity for my mother wa clog with the payment of three to old superannuate servant by my father s will and it be amaze how disagreeable she find it twice every year these annuity be to be pay and then there wa the trouble of get it to them and then one of them wa say to have die and afterwards it turn out to be no such thing my mother wa quite sick of it her income wa not her own she say with such perpetual claim on it and it wa the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have be entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it ha give me such an abhorrence of annuity that i be sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world it be certainly an unpleasant thing reply mr dashwood to have those kind of yearly drain on one s income one s fortune a your mother justly say be not one s own to be tie down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day be by no mean desirable it take away one s independence undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what be expect and it raise no gratitude at all if i be you whatever i do should be do at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some year to spare a hundred or even fifty pound from our own expense i believe you be right my love it will be well that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far great assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of live if they felt sure of a large income and would not be sixpence the rich for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pound now and then will prevent their ever be distress for money and will i think be amply discharge my promise to my father to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i be convince within myself that your father have

will be still well for a you be a handsome a any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the party my dear you flat me i certainly have have my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything

have hear you mention them with consideration these last twenty year at least ah you do not know what i suffer but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year

mixture of quick part sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty year have be insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind wa le difficult to develop she wa a woman of mean understand little information and uncertain temper when she wa discontent she fancy herself nervous the business of her life wa to get her daughter marry it solace wa

honour your circumspection a fortnight s acquaintance be certainly very little one can not know what a man really be by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mr long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore a she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself the girl star at their father mr bennet say only nonsense nonsense what can be the mean of that emphatic exclamation cry he do you consider the form of introduction and the stress that be lay on them a nonsense i can not quite agree with you there

evening wa spend in conjecture how soon he would return mr bennet s visit and determine when they should ask him to dinner chapter not all that mr bennet however with the assistance of her five daughter could ask on the subject wa sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attack him in various way with barefaced question ingenious supposition and distant surmise but he elude the skill of them all and they be at last oblige to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report wa highly favourable sir william have be delight with him he wa quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he mean to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dance wa a certain step towards fall in love and very lively hope of mr bingley s heart be entertain if i can but see one of my daughter happily settle at netherfield say mr bennet to her husband and all the others equally well marry i shall have nothing to wish for in a few day mr bingley return mr bennet s visit and sit about ten minute with him in his library he have entertain hope of be admit to a sight of the young lady of whose beauty he have hear much but he saw only the father the lady be somewhat more fortunate for they have the advantage of ascertain from an upper window that he wear a blue coat and ride a black horse an invitation to dinner wa soon afterwards dispatch and already have mr bennet plan the course that be to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrive which defer it all mr bingley wa oblige to be in town the follow day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mr bennet wa quite disconcert she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she begin to fear that he might be always fly about from one place to another and never settle at netherfield a he ought to be lady lucas quiet her fear a little by start the idea of his be go to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon follow that mr bingley wa to bring twelve lady and seven gentleman with him to the assembly the girl grieve over such a number of lady but be comfort the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he bring only six with him from london his five sister and a cousin and when the party enter the assembly room it consist of only five altogether mr bingley his two sister the husband of the eldest and another young man mr bingley wa good look and gentlemanlike

gentleman pronounce him to be a fine figure of a man the lady declare he wa much handsomer than mr bingley and he wa look at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manner give a disgust which turn the tide of his popularity for he wa discover to be proud to be above his company and above be please and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from have a most forbid disagreeable countenance and be unworthy to be compare with his friend mr bingley have soon make himself acquaint with all the principal people in the room he wa lively and unreserved dance every dance wa angry that the ball close so early and talk of give one himself at netherfield such amiable quality must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy dance only once with mr hurst and once with miss bingley decline be introduce to any other lady and spend the rest of the evening in walk about the room speak occasionally to one of his own party his character wa decide he wa the proud most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hop that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him wa mr bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour wa sharpen into particular resentment by his have slight one of her daughter elizabeth bennet have be oblige by the scarcity of gentleman to sit down for two dance and during part of that time mr darcy have be stand near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr bingley who come from the dance for a few minute to press his friend to join it come darcy say he i must have you dance i hate to see you stand about by yourself in this stupid manner you have much well dance i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i be particularly acquaint with my partner at such an assembly a this it would be insupportable your sister be engage and there be not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious a you be cry mr bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never meet with so many pleasant girl in my life a i have this evening and there be several of them you see uncommonly pretty you be dance with the only handsome girl in the room say mr darcy look at the eldest miss bennet oh she be the most beautiful creature i ever behold but there be one of her sister sit down just behind you who be very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you which do you mean and turn round he look for a moment at elizabeth till catch her eye he withdraw his own and coldly say she be tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i be in no humour at present to give consequence to young lady who be slight by other men you have well return to your partner and enjoy her smile for you be waste your time with me mr bingley follow his advice mr darcy walk off and elizabeth remain with no very cordial feel toward him she tell the story however with great spirit among

the follow spring he wa see again in town find equally agreeable again encourage invite and expect and again he do not come and the next tide be that he wa marry instead of push his fortune in the line mark out for the heir of the house of elliot he have purchase independence by unite himself to a rich woman of inferior birth sir walter have resent it a the head of the house he felt that he ought to have be consult especially after take the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have be see together he observe once at tattersall s and twice in the lobby of the house of common his disapprobation wa express but apparently very little regard mr elliot have attempt no apology and shew himself a unsolicitous of be long notice by the family a sir walter consider him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them have cease this very awkward history of mr elliot wa still after an interval of several year felt with anger by elizabeth who have like the man for himself and still more for be her father s heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot s eldest daughter there wa not a baronet from a to z whom her feel could have so willingly acknowledge a an equal yet so miserably have he conduct himself that though she wa at this present time the summer of wear black ribbon for his wife she could not admit him to be worth think of again the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps a there wa no reason to suppose it perpetuate by offspring have be get over have he not do bad but he have a by the accustomary intervention of kind friend they have be inform speak most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belong to and the honour which be hereafter to be his own this could not be pardon such be elizabeth elliot s sentiment and sensation such the care to alloy the agitation to vary the sameness and the elegance the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life such the feel to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle to fill the vacancy which there be no habit of utility abroad no talent or accomplishment for home to occupy but now another occupation and solicitude of mind wa begin to be add to these her father wa grow distress for money she know that when he now take up the baronetage it wa to drive the heavy bill of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hint of mr shepherd his agent from his think the kellynch property wa good but not equal to sir walter s apprehension of the state require in it possessor while lady elliot live there have be method moderation and economy which have just keep him within his income but with her have die all such right mindedness and from that period he have be constantly exceed it it have not be possible for him to spend le he have do nothing but what sir walter elliot wa imperiously call on to do but blameless a he wa he wa not only grow dreadfully in debt but wa hearing of it so often that it become vain to attempt conceal it long even partially from his daughter he have give her some hint of it the last spring in town he have go so far even a to say can we retrench doe it occur to you that there be any one article in which we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice have in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be do and have finally propose these two branch of economy to cut off some unnecessary charity and to refrain from new furnishing the draw room to which expedient she afterwards add the happy think of their take no present down to anne a have be the usual yearly custom but these measure however good in themselves be insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter find himself oblige to confess to her soon afterwards elizabeth have nothing to propose of deep efficacy she felt herself ill use and unfortunate a do her father and they be neither of them able to devise any mean of lessen their expense without compromise their dignity or relinquish their comfort in a way not to be bear there wa only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but have every acre be alienable it would have make no difference he have condescend to mortgage a far a he have the power but he would never condescend to sell no he would never disgrace his name so far the kellynch estate should be transmit whole and entire a he have receive it their two confidential friend mr shepherd who live in the neighbour market town and lady russell be call to advise them and both father and daughter seem to expect that something should be strike out by one or the other to remove their embarrassment and reduce their expenditure without involve the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride chapter mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his view on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompt by anybody else excuse himself from offer the slight hint and only beg leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose know good sense he fully expect to have just such resolute measure advise a he mean to see finally adopt lady russell wa most anxiously zealous on the subject and give it much serious consideration she wa a woman rather of sound than of quick ability whose difficulty in come to any decision in this instance be great from the opposition of two lead principle she wa of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she wa a desirous of save sir walter s feel a solicitous for the credit of the family a aristocratic in her idea of what wa due to them a anybody of sense and honesty could well be she wa a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachment most correct in her conduct strict in her notion of decorum and with manner that be hold a standard of good breeding she have a cultivate mind and wa generally speak rational and consistent but she have

95,allanPoe_worksOfAllanPoeVol2,allan_poe,97268,the work of edgar allan poe the purloin letter nil sapientiae odiosius acumine nimio seneca at paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of i wa enjoy the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in company with my friend c auguste dupin in his little back library or book closet au troisiême no rue dunôt faubourg st germain for one hour at least we have maintain a profound silence while each to any casual observer might have seem intently and exclusively occupy with the curl eddy of smoke that oppress the atmosphere of the chamber for myself however i wa mentally discus certain topic which have form matter for conversation between u at an early period of the evening i mean the affair of the rue morgue and the mystery attend the murder of marie rogêt i look upon it therefore a something of a coincidence when the door of our apartment wa throw open and admit our old acquaintance monsieur g the prefect of the parisian police we give him a hearty welcome for there wa nearly half a much of the entertain a of the contemptible about the man and we have not see him for several year we have be sit in the dark and dupin now arise for the purpose of light a lamp but sit down again without do so upon g ’ s say that he have call to consult u or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which have occasion a great deal of trouble if it be any point require reflection observe dupin a he forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to well purpose in the dark that be another of your odd notion say the prefect who have a fashion of call every thing odd that wa beyond his comprehension and thus live amid an absolute legion of oddity very true say dupin a he supply his visiter with a pipe and roll towards him a comfortable chair and what be the difficulty now i ask nothing more in the assassination way i hope oh no nothing of that nature the fact be the business be very simple indeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves but then i think dupin would like to hear the detail of it because it be so excessively odd simple and odd say dupin why yes and not exactly that either the fact be we have all be a good deal puzzle because the affair be so simple and yet baffle u altogether perhaps it be the very simplicity of the thing which put you at fault say my friend what nonsense you do talk reply the prefect laugh heartily perhaps the mystery be a little too plain say dupin oh good heaven who ever hear of such an idea a little too self evident ha ha ha ha ha ha ho ho ho roar our visiter profoundly amuse oh dupin you will be the death of me yet and what after all be the matter on hand i ask why i will tell you reply the prefect a he give a long steady and contemplative puff and settle himself in his chair i will tell you in a few word but before i begin let me caution you that this be an affair demand the greatest secrecy and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold be it know that i confide it to any one proceed say i or not say dupin well then i have receive personal information from a very high quarter that a certain document of the last importance ha be purloin from the royal apartment the individual who purloin it be know this beyond a doubt he wa see to take it it be know also that it still remain in his possession how be this know ask dupin it be clearly infer reply the prefect from the nature of the document and from the non appearance of certain result which would at once arise from it pass out of the robber ’ s possession that be to say from his employ it a he must design in the end to employ it be a little more explicit i say well i may venture so far a to say that the paper give it holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power be immensely valuable the prefect wa fond of the cant of diplomacy still i do not quite understand say dupin no well the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalt station and this fact give the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace be so jeopardize but this ascendancy i interpose would depend upon the robber ’ s knowledge of the loser ’ s knowledge of the robber who would dare the thief say g be the minister d who dare all thing those unbecoming a well a those become a man the method of the theft wa not le ingenious than bold the document in question a letter to be frank have be receive by the personage rob while alone in the royal boudoir during it perusal she wa suddenly interrupt by the entrance of the other exalt personage from whom especially it wa her wish to conceal it after a hurry and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she wa force to place it open a it wa upon a table the address however wa uppermost and the content thus unexposed the letter escape notice at this juncture enter the minister d his lynx eye immediately perceive the paper recognise the handwriting of the address observe the confusion of the personage address and fathom her secret after some business transaction hurry through in his ordinary manner he produce a letter somewhat similar to the one in question open it pretend to read it and then place it in close juxtaposition to the other again he converse for some fifteen minute upon the public affair at length in take leave he take also from the table the letter to which he have no claim it rightful owner saw but of course dare not call attention to the act in the presence of the third personage who stand at her elbow the minister decamp leave his own letter one of no importance upon the table here then say dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete the robber ’ s knowledge of the loser ’ s knowledge of the robber yes reply the prefect and the power thus attain ha for some month past be wield for political purpose to a very dangerous extent the personage rob be more thoroughly convince every day of the necessity of reclaim her letter but this of course can not be do openly in fine drive to despair she ha commit the matter to me than whom say dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagacious agent could i suppose be desire or even imagine you flat me reply the prefect but it be possible that some such opinion may have be entertain it be clear say i a you observe that the letter be still in possession of the minister since it be this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestow the power with the employment the power depart true say g and upon this conviction i proceed my first care wa to make thorough search of the minister ’ s hotel and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of search without his knowledge beyond all thing i have be warn of the danger which would result from give him reason to suspect our design but say i you be quite au fait in these investigation the parisian police have do this thing often before o yes and for this reason i do not despair the habit of the minister give me too a great advantage he be frequently absent from home all night his servant be by no mean numerous they sleep at a distance from their master ’ s apartment and be chiefly neapolitan be readily make drink i have key a you know with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three month a night ha not pass during the great part of which i have not be engage personally in ransack the d hotel my honor be interest and to mention a great secret the reward be enormous so i do not abandon the search until i have become fully satisfy that the thief be a more astute man than myself i fancy that i have investigate every nook and corner of the premise in which it be possible that the paper can be conceal but be it not possible i suggest that although the letter may be in possession of the minister a it unquestionably be he may have conceal it elsewhere than upon his own premise this be barely possible say dupin the present peculiar condition of affair at court and especially of those intrigue in which d be know to be involve would render the instant availability of the document it susceptibility of be produce at a moment ’ s notice a point of nearly equal importance with it possession it susceptibility of be produce say i that be to say of be destroy say dupin true i observe the paper be clearly then upon the premise a for it be upon the person of the minister we may consider that a out of the question entirely say the prefect he ha be twice waylay a if by footpad and his person rigorously search under my own inspection you might have spar yourself this trouble say dupin d i presume be not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipate these waylay a a matter of course not altogether a fool say g but then he ’ s a poet which i take to be only one remove from a fool true say dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although i have be guilty of certain doggrel myself suppose you detail say i the particular of your search why the fact be we take our time and we search every where i have have long experience in these affair i take the entire build room by room devote the night of a whole week to each we examine first the furniture of each apartment we open every possible drawer and i presume you know that to a properly train police agent such a thing a a secret drawer be impossible any man be a dolt who permit a ‘ secret ’ drawer to escape him in a search of this kind the thing be so plain there be a certain amount of bulk of space to be account for in every cabinet then we have accurate rule the fiftieth part of a line could not escape u after the cabinet we take the chair the cushion we probe with the fine long needle you have see me employ from the table we remove the top why so sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arrange piece of furniture be remove by the person wish to conceal an article then the leg be excavate the article deposit within the cavity and the top replace the bottom and top of bedpost be employ in the same way but could not the cavity be detect by sound i ask by no mean if when the article be deposit a sufficient wad of cotton be place around it besides in our case we be oblige to proceed without noise but you could not have remove you could not have take to piece all article of furniture in which it would have be possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention a letter may be compress into a thin spiral roll not differ much in shape or bulk from a large knit needle and in this form it might be insert into the ring of a chair for example you do not take to piece all the chair certainly not but we do well we examine the ring of every chair in the hotel and indeed the joint of every description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope have there be any trace of recent disturbance we should not have fail to detect it instantly a single grain of gimlet dust for example would have be a obvious a an apple any disorder in the glue any unusual gap in the joint would have suffice to insure detection i presume you look to the mirror between the board and the plate and you probe the bed and the bed clothe a well a the curtain and carpet that of course and when we have absolutely complete every particle of the furniture in this way then we examine the house itself we divide it entire surface into compartment which we number so that none might be miss then we scrutinize each individual square inch throughout the premise include the two house immediately adjoin with the microscope a before the two house adjoin i exclaim you must have have a great deal of trouble we have but the reward offer be prodigious you include the grind about the house all the grind be pave with brick they give u comparatively little trouble we examine the moss between the brick and find it undisturbed you look among d ‘ s paper of course and into the book of the library certainly we open every package and parcel we not only open every book but we turn over every leaf in each volume not content ourselves with a mere shake accord to the fashion of some of our police officer we also measure the thickness of every book cover with the most accurate admeasurement and apply to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope have any of the bind be recently meddle with it would have be utterly impossible that the fact should have escape observation some five or six volume just from the hand of the binder we carefully probe longitudinally with the needle you explore the floor beneath the carpet beyond doubt we remove every carpet and examine the board with the microscope and the paper on the wall yes you look into the cellar we do then i say you have be make a miscalculation and the letter be not upon the premise a you suppose i fear you be right there say the prefect and now dupin what would you advise me to do to make a thorough re search of the premise that be absolutely needle reply g i be not more sure that i breathe than i be that the letter be not at the hotel i have no well advice to give you say dupin you have of course an accurate description of the letter oh yes and here the prefect produce a memorandum book proceed to read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of the external appearance of the miss document soon after finish the perusal of this description he take his departure more entirely depress in spirit than i have ever know the good gentleman before in about a month afterwards he pay u another visit and find u occupy very nearly a before he take a pipe and a chair and enter into some ordinary conversation at length i say well but g what of the purloin letter i presume you have at last make up your mind that there be no such thing a overreach the minister confound him say i yes i make the re examination however a dupin suggest but it wa all labor lose a i know it would be how much wa the reward offer do you say ask dupin why a very great deal a very liberal reward i don ’ t like to say how much precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldn ’ t mind give my individual check for fifty thousand franc to any one who could obtain me that letter the fact be it be become of more and more importance every day and the reward ha be lately double if it be treble however i could do no more than i have do why yes say dupin drawlingly between the whiff of his meerschaum i really think g you have not exert yourself to the utmost in this matter you might do a little more i think eh how in what way ’ why puff puff you might puff puff employ counsel in the matter eh puff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of abernethy no hang abernethy to be sure hang him and welcome but once upon a time a certain rich miser conceive the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical opinion get up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in a private company he insinuate his case to the physician a that of an imaginary individual ‘ we will suppose ’ say the miser ‘ that his symptom be such and such now doctor what would you have direct him to take ’ ‘ take ’ say abernethy ‘ why take advice to be sure ’ but say the prefect a little discompose i be perfectly will to take advice and to pay for it i would really give fifty thousand franc to any one who would aid me in the matter in that case reply dupin opening a drawer and produce a check book you may a well fill me up a check for the amount mention when you

series of adventure in the south sea and elsewhere of which an account be give in the follow page accident throw me into the society of several gentleman in richmond va who felt deep interest in all matter relate to the region i have visit and who be constantly urging it upon me a a duty to give my narrative to the public i have several reason however for decline to do so some of which be of a nature altogether private and concern no person but myself others not so much so one consideration which deter me wa that have keep no journal during a great portion of the time in which i wa absent i fear i should not be able to write from mere memory a statement so minute and connect a to have the appearance of that truth it would really posse bar only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of u be prone when detail event which have have powerful influence in excite the imaginative faculty another reason wa that the incident to be narrate be of a nature so positively marvellous that unsupported a my assertion must necessarily be except by the evidence of a single individual and he a half breed indian i could only hope for belief among my family and those of my friend who have have reason through life to put faith in my veracity the probability be that the public at large would regard what i should put forth a merely an impudent and ingenious fiction a distrust in my own ability a a writer wa nevertheless one of the principal cause which prevent me from comply with the suggestion of my adviser among those gentleman in virginia who express the greatest interest in my statement more particularly in regard to that portion of it which relate to the antarctic ocean wa mr poe lately editor of the southern literary messenger a monthly magazine publish by mr thomas w white in the city of richmond he strongly advise me among others to prepare at once a full account of what i have see and undergo and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the public insist with great plausibility that however roughly a regard mere authorship my book should be get up it very uncouthness if there be any would give it all the well chance of be receive a truth notwithstanding this representation i do not make up my mind to do a he suggest he afterward propose find that i would not stir in the matter that i should allow him to draw up in his own word a narrative of the early portion of my adventure from fact afford by myself publish it in the southern messenger under the garb of fiction to this perceive no objection i consent stipulate only that my real name should be retain two number of the pretend fiction appear consequently in the messenger for january and february and in order that it might certainly be regard a fiction the name of mr poe wa affix to the article in the table of content of the magazine the manner in which this ruse wa receive ha induce me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventure in question for i find that in spite of the air of fable which have be so ingeniously throw around that portion of my statement which appear in the messenger without alter or distort a single fact the public be still not at all dispose to receive it a fable and several letter be send to mr p ’ s address distinctly express a conviction to the contrary i thence conclude that the fact of my narrative would prove of such a nature a to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity and that i have consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity this exposé be make it will be see at once how much of what follow i claim to be my own write and it will also be understand that no fact be misrepresent in the first few page which be write by mr poe even to those reader who have not see the messenger it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion end and my own commence the difference in point of style will be readily perceive a g pym chapter my name be arthur gordon pym my father wa a respectable trader in sea store at nantucket where i wa bear my maternal grandfather wa an attorney in good practice he wa fortunate in every thing and have speculate very successfully in stock of the edgarton new bank a it wa formerly call by these and other mean he have manage to lay by a tolerable sum of money he wa more attach to myself i believe than to any other person in the world and i expect to inherit the most of his property at his death he send me at six year of age to the school of old mr ricketts a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manner he be well know to almost every person who ha visit new bedford i stay at his school until i wa sixteen when i leave him for mr e ronald ’ s academy on the hill here i become intimate with the son of mr barnard a sea captain who generally sail in the employ of lloyd and vredenburgh mr barnard be also very well know in new bedford and ha many relation i be certain in edgarton his son wa name augustus and he wa nearly two year old than myself he have be on a whale voyage with his father in the john donaldson and wa always talk to me of his adventure in the south pacific ocean i use frequently to go home with him and remain all day and sometimes all night we occupy the same bed and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light tell me story of the native of the island of tinian and other place he have visit in his travel at last i could not help be interest in what he say and by degree i felt the greatest desire to go to sea i own a sailboat call the ariel and worth about seventy five dollar she have a half deck or cuddy and wa rig sloop fashion i forget her tonnage but she would hold ten person without much crowd in this boat we be in the habit of go on some of the maddest freak in the world and when i now think of them it appear to me a thousand wonder that i be alive to day i will relate one of these adventure by way of introduction to a long and more momentous narrative one night there wa a party at mr barnard ’ s and both augustus and myself be not a little intoxicate toward the close of it a usual in such case i take part of his bed in preference to go home he go to sleep a i think very quietly it be near one when the party break up and without say a word on his favorite topic it might have be half an hour from the time of our get in bed and i wa just about fall into a doze when he suddenly start up and swear with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any arthur pym in christendom when there wa so glorious a breeze from the southwest i never wa so astonish in my life not know what he intend and think that the wine and liquor he have drink have set him entirely beside himself he proceed to talk very coolly however say he know that i suppose him intoxicate but that he wa never more sober in his life he wa only tire he add of lie in bed on such a fine night like a dog and wa determine to get up and dress and go out on a frolic with the boat i can hardly tell what possess me but the word be no sooner out of his mouth than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure and think his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable thing in the world it wa blow almost a gale and the weather wa very cold it be late in october i spring out of bed nevertheless in a kind of ecstasy and tell him i wa quite a brave a himself and quite a tire a he wa of lie in bed like a dog and quite a ready for any fun or frolic a any augustus barnard in nantucket we lose no time in get on our clothe and hurry down to the boat she wa lie at the old decay wharf by the lumber yard of pankey co and almost thump her side out against the rough log augustus get into her and bail her for she wa nearly half full of water this be do we hoist jib and mainsail keep full and start boldly out to sea the wind a i before say blow freshly from the southwest the night wa very clear and cold augustus have take the helm and i station myself by the mast on the deck of the cuddy we fly along at a great rate neither of u have say a word since cast loose from the wharf i now ask my companion what course he intend to steer and what time he think it probable we should get back he whistle for a few minute and then say crustily i be go to sea you may go home if you think proper turn my eye upon him i perceive at once that in spite of his assume nonchalance he wa greatly agitate i could see him distinctly by the light of the moon his face wa paler than any marble and his hand shake so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller i find that something have go wrong and become seriously alarm at this period i know little about the management of a boat and wa now depend entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend the wind too have suddenly increase a we be fast get out of the lee of the land still i wa ashamed to betray any trepidation and for almost half an hour maintain a resolute silence i could stand it no long however and speak to augustus about the propriety of turn back a before it wa nearly a minute before he make answer or take any notice of my suggestion by and by say he at length time enough home by and by i have expect a similar reply but there wa something in the tone of these word which fill me with an indescribable feel of dread i again look at the speaker attentively his lip be perfectly livid and his knee shake so violently together that he seem scarcely able to stand for god ’ s sake augustus i scream now heartily frighten what ail you what be the matter what be you go to do matter he stammer in the greatest apparent surprise let go the tiller at the same moment and fall forward into the bottom of the boat matter why nothing be the matter go home d d don ’ t you see the whole truth now flash upon me i fly to him and raise him up he wa drink beastly drink he could no long either stand speak or see his eye be perfectly glaze and a i let him go in the extremity of my despair he roll like a mere log into the bilge water from which i have lift him it wa evident that during the evening he have drink far more than i suspect and that his conduct in bed have be the result of a highly concentrate state of intoxication a state which like madness frequently enable the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his sen the coolness of the night air however have have it usual effect the mental energy begin to yield before it influence and the confuse perception which he no doubt then have of his perilous situation have assist in hasten the catastrophe he wa now thoroughly insensible and there wa no probability that he would be otherwise for many hour it be hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror the fume of the wine lately take have evaporate leave me doubly timid and irresolute i know that i wa altogether incapable of manage the boat and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide be hurry u to destruction a storm wa evidently gather behind u we have neither compass nor provision and it wa clear that if we hold our present course we should be out of sight of land before daybreak these think with a crowd of others equally fearful flash through my mind with a bewilder rapidity and for some moment paralyze me beyond the possibility of make any exertion the boat wa go through the water at a terrible rate full before the wind no reef in either jib or mainsail run her bow completely under the foam it wa a thousand wonder she do not broach to augustus have let go the tiller a i say before and i be too much agitate to think of take it myself by good luck however she keep steady and gradually i recover some degree of presence of mind still the wind wa increase fearfully and whenever we rise from a plunge forward the sea behind fell comb over our counter and deluge u with water i wa so utterly benumb too in every limb a to be nearly unconscious of sensation at length i summon up the resolution of despair and rush to the mainsail let it go by the run a might have be expect it fly over the bow and get drench with water carry away the mast short off by the board this latter accident alone save me from instant destruction under the jib only i now boom along before the wind ship heavy sea occasionally over the counter but relieve from the terror of immediate death i take the helm and breathe with great freedom a i find that there yet remain to u a chance of ultimate escape augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat and a there wa imminent danger of his drown the water be nearly a foot deep just where he fell i contrive to raise him partially up and keep him in a sit position by pass a rope round his waist and lash it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy have thus arrange every thing a well a i could in my chill and agitate condition i recommend myself to god and make up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power hardly have i come to this resolution when suddenly a loud and long scream or yell a if from the throat of a thousand demon seem to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i experience at that moment my hair stand erect on my head i felt the blood congeal in my vein my heart cease utterly to beat and without have once raise my eye to learn the source of my alarm i tumble headlong and insensible upon the body of my fall companion i find myself upon revive in the cabin of a large whale ship the penguin bind to nantucket several person be stand over me and augustus paler than death wa busily occupy in chafe my hand upon see me open my eye his exclamation of gratitude and joy excite alternate laughter and tear from the rough look personage who be present the mystery of our be in existence wa now soon explain we have be run down by the whale ship which wa close haul beat up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set and consequently run almost at right angle to our own course several men be on the look out forward but do not perceive our boat until it wa an impossibility to avoid come in contact their shout of warn upon see u be what so terribly alarm me the huge ship i wa tell ride immediately over u with a much ease a our own little vessel would have pass over a feather and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress not a scream arise from the deck of the victim there wa a slight grate sound to be hear mingle with the roar of wind and water a the frail bark which wa swallow

have it be like that of the sphere of hermes it be divide into many system each revolve round it several sun and often present to the rest only the faint glimmer of a milk and water way our capital city unlike london or paris be not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to the extremity but resemble more an isolate umbilicus stick down a near a may be to the centre of the land and seem rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any present need boston new york philadelphia each ha it literature almost more distinct than those of the different dialect of germany and the young queen of the west ha also one of her own of which some articulate rumor barely ha reach u dweller by the atlantic perhaps there be no task more difficult than the just criticism of contemporary literature it be even more grateful to give praise where it be need than where it be deserve and friendship so often seduce the iron stylus of justice into a vague flourish that she write what seem rather like an epitaph than a criticism yet if praise be give a an alms we could not drop so poisonous a one into any man ’ s hat the critic ’ s ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of sugar but it be easy to be generous than to be just and we might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hide place of truth do we judge from the amount of water which we usually find mix with it remarkable experience be usually confine to the inner life of imaginative men but mr poe ’ s biography display a vicissitude and peculiarity of interest such a

graduate with the high honor of his class then come a boyish attempt to join the fortune of the insurgent greek which end at st petersburg where he get into difficulty through want of a passport from which he wa rescue by the american consul and send home he now enter the military academy at west point from which he obtain a dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopt father by a second marriage an event which cut off his expectation a an heir the death of mr allan in whose will his name wa not mention soon after relieve him of all doubt in this regard and he commit himself at once to authorship for a support previously to this however he have publish in a small volume of poem which soon run through three edition and excite high expectation of it author ’ s future distinction in the mind of many competent judge that no certain augury can be draw from a poet ’ s early lisp there be instance enough to prove shakespeare ’ s first poem though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness give but a very faint promise of the directness condensation and overflow moral of his mature work perhaps however shakespeare be hardly a case in point his venus and adonis have be publish we believe in his twenty sixth year milton ’ s latin verse show tenderness a fine eye for nature and a delicate appreciation of classic model but give no hint of the author of a new

sympathy in behalf of the inhabitant i design here to give a history of the calamitous event which have so lately occur within it limit no one who know me will doubt that the duty thus self impose will be execute to the best of my ability with all that rigid impartiality all that cautious examination into fact and diligent collation of authority which should ever distinguish him who aspire to the title of historian by the unite aid of medal manuscript and inscription i be enable to say positively that the borough of vondervotteimittiss ha exist from it origin in precisely the same condition which it at present preserve of the date of this origin however i grieve that i can only speak with that specie of indefinite definiteness which mathematician be at time force to put up with in certain algebraic formula the date i may thus say in regard to the remoteness of it antiquity can not be le than any assignable quantity whatsoever touch the derivation of the name vondervotteimittiss i confess myself with sorrow equally at fault among a multitude of opinion upon this delicate point some acute some learn some sufficiently the reverse i be able to select nothing

pocket to say the truth he ha something of more importance than a watch to attend to and what that be i shall presently explain he sit with his right leg upon his leave knee wear a grave countenance and always keep one of his eye at least resolutely bend upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain this object be situate in the steeple of the house of the town council the town council be all very little round oily intelligent men with big saucer eye and fat double chin and have their coat much long and their shoe buckle much big than the ordinary inhabitant of vondervotteimittiss since my sojourn in the borough they have have several special meet and have adopt these three important resolution that it be wrong to alter the good old course of thing that there be nothing tolerable out of vondervotteimittiss and that we will stick by our clock and our cabbage above the session room of the council be the steeple and in the steeple be the belfry where exist and ha exist time out of mind the pride and wonder of the village the great clock of the borough of vondervotteimittiss and this be the object to which the eye of the old gentleman be turn who sit in the leather bottom arm chair the great clock ha seven face one in each of the seven side of the steeple so that it can be readily see from all quarter it face be large and white and it hand heavy and black there be a belfry man whose sole duty be to attend to it but this duty be the most perfect of sinecure for the clock of vondervotteimittis wa never yet know to have anything the matter with it until lately the bare supposition of such a thing wa consider heretical from the remote period of antiquity to which the archive have reference the hour have be regularly strike by the big bell and indeed the case wa just the same with all the other clock and watch in the borough never wa such a place for keep the true time when the large clapper think proper to say twelve o ’ clock all it obedient follower open their throat simultaneously and respond like a very echo in short the good burgher be fond of their sauer kraut but then they be proud of their clock all people who hold sinecure office be hold in more or le respect and a the belfry man of vondervotteimittiss ha the most perfect of sinecure he be the most perfectly respect of any man in the world he be the chief dignitary of the borough and the very pig look up to him with a sentiment of reverence his coat tail be very far long his pipe his shoe buckle his eye and his stomach very far big than those of any other old gentleman in the village and a to his chin it be not only double but triple i have thus paint the happy estate of vondervotteimittiss ala that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse there ha be long a say among the wise inhabitant that no good can come from over the hill and it really seem that the word have in them something of the spirit of prophecy it want five minute of noon on the day before yesterday when there appear a very odd look object on the summit of the ridge of the eastward such an occurrence of course attract universal attention and every little old gentleman who sit in a leather bottom arm chair turn one of his eye with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon still keep the other upon the clock in the steeple by the time that it want only three minute to noon the droll object in question wa perceive to be a very diminutive foreign look young man he descend the hill at a great rate so that every body have soon a good look at him he wa really the most finicky little personage that have ever be see in vondervotteimittiss his countenance wa of a dark snuff color and he have a long hook nose pea eye a wide mouth and an excellent set of teeth which latter he seem anxious of display a he wa grinning from ear to ear what with mustachio and whisker there wa none of the rest of his face to be see his head wa uncover and his hair neatly do up in papillotes his dress wa a tight fit swallow tail black coat from one of whose pocket dangle a vast length of white handkerchief black kerseymere knee breech black stock and stumpy look pump with huge bunch of black satin ribbon for bow under one arm he carry a huge chapeau de bra and under the other a fiddle nearly five time a big a himself in his leave hand wa a gold snuff box from which a he caper down the hill cut all manner of fantastic step he take snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self satisfaction god bless me here wa a sight for the honest burgher of vondervotteimittiss to speak plainly the fellow have in spite of his grinning an audacious and sinister kind of face and a he curvet right into the village the old stumpy appearance of his pump excite no little suspicion and many a burgher who behold him that day would have give a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hang so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow tail coat but what mainly occasion a righteous indignation wa that the scoundrelly popinjay while he cut a fandango here and a whirligig there do not seem to have the remote idea in the world of such a thing a keep time in his step the good people of the borough have scarcely a chance however to get their eye thoroughly open when just a it want half a minute of noon the rascal bounce a i say right into the midst of them give a chassez here and a balancez there and then after a pirouette and a pa de zephyr pigeon wing himself right up into the belfry of the house of the town council where the wonder stricken belfry man sit smoking in a state of dignity and dismay but the little chap seize him at once by the nose give it a swing and a pull clap the big chapeau de bra upon his head knock it down over his eye and mouth and then lift up the big fiddle beat him with it so long and so soundly that what with the belfry man be so fat and the fiddle be so hollow you would have swear that there wa a regiment of double bass drummer all beat the devil ’ s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of vondervotteimittiss there be no know to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have arouse the inhabitant but for the important fact that it now want only half a second of noon the bell wa about to strike and it wa a matter of absolute and pre eminent necessity that every body should look well at his watch it wa evident however that just at this moment the fellow in the steeple wa do something that he have no business to do with the clock but a it now begin to strike nobody have any time to attend to his manoeuvre for they have all to count the stroke of the bell a it sound one say the clock von echo every little old gentleman in every leather bottom arm chair in
