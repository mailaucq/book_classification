sharp radiating or bifurcating ridges as if they had been but not really corroded internally they are penetrated by branching veins like those of calcareous spar in the septaria of the London clay of pure white anhydrite These veins might naturally have been thought to have been formed by subsequent infiltration had not each little embedded fragment of rock been likewise edged in a very remarkable manner by a narrow border of the same white anhydrite this shows that the veins must have been formed by a process of segregation and not of infiltration Some of the little included and CRACKED fragments of foreign rock are penetrated by the anhydrite and portions have evidently been thus mechanically displaced at St Helena I observed that calcareous matter deposited by rain water also had the power to separate small fragments of rock from the larger masses Volcanic Islands etc page I believe the superficial gypseous deposit is widely extended I received specimens of it from Pisagua forty miles north of Iquique and likewise from Arica where it coats a layer of pure salt M d Orbigny found at Cobija a bed of clay lying above a mass of upraised recent shells which was saturated with sulphate of soda and included thin layers of fibrous gypsum Voyage Geolog etc page These widely extended superficial beds of salt and gypsum appear to me an interesting geological phenomenon which could be presented only under a very dry climate The plain or basin on the borders of which the famous bed of nitrate of soda lies is situated at the distance of about thirty miles from the sea being separated from it by the saliferous district just described It stands at a height of feet its surface is level and some leagues in width it extends forty miles northward and has a total length as I was informed by Mr Belford Wilson the Consul General at Lima of miles In a well near the works thirty six yards in depth sand earth and a little gravel were found in another well near Almonte fifty yards deep the whole consisted according to Mr Blake of clay including a layer of sand two feet thick which rested on fine gravel and this on coarse gravel with large rounded fragments of rock See an admirable paper Geological and Miscellaneous Notices of Tarapaca in Silliman s American Journal volume page In many parts of this now utterly desert plain rushes and large prostrate trees in a hardened state apparently Mimosas are found buried at a depth from three to six feet according to Mr Blake they have all fallen to the south west The bed of nitrate of soda is said to extend for forty to fifty leagues along the western margin of the plain but is not found in its central parts it is from two to three feet in thickness and is so hard that it is generally blasted with gunpowder it slopes gently upwards from the edge of the plain to between ten and thirty feet above its level It rests on sand in which it is said vegetable remains and broken shells have been found shells have also been found according to Mr Blake both on and in the nitrate of soda It is covered by a superficial mass of sand containing nodules of common salt and as I was assured by a miner much soft gypseous matter precisely like that in the superficial crust already described certainly this crust with its characteristic concretions of anhydrite comes close down to the edge of the plain The nitrate of soda varies in purity in different parts and often contains nodules of common salt According to Mr Blake the proportion of nitrate of soda varies from to per cent An analysis by Mr A Hayes of an average specimen gave Nitrate of Soda Sulphate of Soda Chloride of Soda Iodic Salts Shells and Marl The mother water at some of the refineries is very rich in iodic salts and is supposed to contain much muriate of lime Literary Gazette page In an unrefined specimen brought home by myself Mr T Reeks has ascertained that the muriate of lime is very abundant With respect to the origin of this saline mass from the manner in which the gently inclined compact bed follows for so many miles the sinuous margin of the plain there can be no doubt that it was deposited from a sheet of water from the fragments of embedded shells from the abundant iodic salts from the superficial saliferous crust occurring at a higher level and being probably of marine origin and from the plain resembling in form those of Chile and that of Uspallata there can be little doubt that this sheet of water was at least originally connected with the sea From an official document shown me by Mr Belford Wilson it appears that the first export of nitrate of soda to Europe was in July on French account in a British ship In year the entire export was in Quintals The Spanish quintal nearly equals English pounds THIN SUPERFICIAL SALINE INCRUSTATIONS These saline incrustations are common in many parts of America Humboldt met with them on the tableland of Mexico and the Jesuit Falkner and other authors state that they occur at intervals over the vast plains extending from the mouth of the Plata to Rioja and Catamarca Azara Travels volume page considers that the Parana is the eastern boundary of the saliferous region but I heard of salitrales in the Province of Entre Rios Hence it is that during droughts most of the streams in the Pampas are saline I nowhere met with these incrustations so abundantly as near Bahia Blanca square miles of the mud flats which near that place are raised only a few feet above the sea just enough to protect them from being overflowed appear after dry weather whiter than the ground after the thickest hoar frost After rain GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON SOUTH AMERICA by CHARLES DARWIN EDITORIAL NOTE Although in some respects more technical in their subjects and style than Darwin s Journal the books here reprinted will never lose their value and interest for the originality of the observations they contain Many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight into problems regarding the structure and changes of the earth s surface and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical geology and physiography in their application to special domains The books themselves can not be obtained for many times the price of the present volume and both the general reader who desires to know more of Darwin s work and the student of geology who naturally wishes to know how a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects will be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and cheap form The three introductions

whole community was in a hubbub Heads in mob caps popped out of every window and such a clamor of tongues ensued that I was fain to stop my ears Every Amazon took part with one or other of the disputants and brandished her arms dripping with soapsuds and fired away from her window as from the embrazure of a fortress while the swarms of children nestled and cradled in every procreant chamber of this hive waking with the noise set up their shrill pipes to swell the general concert Poor Goldsmith what a time must he have had of it with his quiet Disposition and nervous habits penned up in this den of noise and vulgarity How strange that while every sight and sound was sufficient to embitter the heart and fill it with misanthropy his pen should be dropping the honey of Hybla Yet it is more than probable that he drew many of his inimitable pictures of low life from the scenes which surrounded him in this abode The circumstance of Mrs Tibbs being obliged to wash her husband s two shirts in a neighbor s house who refused to lend her washtub may have been no sport of fancy but a fact passing under his own eye His landlady may have sat for the picture and Beau Tibbs scanty wardrobe have been a facsimile of his own It was with some difficulty that we found our way to Dribble s lodgings They were up two pair of stairs in a room that looked upon the court and when we entered he was seated on the edge of his bed writing at a broken table He received us however with a free open poor devil air that was irresistible It is true he did at first appear slightly confused buttoned up his waistcoat a little higher and tucked in a stray frill of linen But he recollected himself in an instant gave a half swagger half leer as he stepped forth to receive us drew a three legged stool for Mr Buckthorne pointed me to a lumbering old damask chair that looked like a dethroned monarch in exile and bade us welcome to his garret We soon got engaged in conversation Buckthorne and he had much to say about early school scenes and as nothing opens a man s heart more than recollections of the kind we soon drew from him a brief outline of his literary career THE POOR DEVIL AUTHOR I began life unluckily by being the wag and bright fellow at school and I had the farther misfortune of becoming the great genius of my native village My father was a country attorney and intended that I should succeed him in business but I had too much genius to study and he was too fond of my genius to force it into the traces So I fell into bad company and took to bad habits Do not mistake me I mean that I fell into the company of village literati and village blues and took to writing village poetry It was quite the fashion in the village to be literary We had a little knot of choice spirits who assembled frequently together formed ourselves into a Literary Scientific and Philosophical Society and fancied ourselves the most learned philos in existence Every one had a great character assigned him suggested by some casual habit or affectation One heavy fellow drank an enormous quantity of tea rolled in his armchair talked sententiously pronounced dogmatically and was considered a second Dr Johnson another who happened to be a curate uttered coarse jokes wrote doggerel rhymes and was the Swift of our association Thus we had also our Popes and Goldsmiths and Addisons and a blue stocking lady whose drawing room we frequented who corresponded about nothing with all the world and wrote letters with the stiffness and formality of a printed book was cried up as another Mrs Montagu I was by common consent the juvenile prodigy the poetical youth the great genius the pride and hope of the village through whom it was to become one day as celebrated as Stratford on Avon My father died and left me his blessing and his business His blessing brought no money into my pocket and as to his business it soon deserted me for I was busy writing poetry and could not attend to law and my clients though they had great respect for my talents had no faith in a poetical attorney I lost my business therefore spent my money and finished my poem It was the Pleasures of Melancholy and was cried up to the skies by the whole circle The Pleasures of Imagination the Pleasures of Hope and the Pleasures of Memory though each had placed its author in the first rank of poets were blank prose in comparison Our Mrs Montagu would cry over it from beginning to end It was pronounced by all the members of the Literary Scientific and Philosophical Society the greatest poem of the age and all anticipated the noise it would make in the great world There was not a doubt but the London booksellers would be mad after it and the only fear of my friends was that I would make a sacrifice by selling it too cheap Every time they talked the matter over they increased the price They reckoned up the great sums given for the poems of certain popular writers and determined that mine was worth more than all put together and ought to be paid for accordingly For my part I was modest in my expectations and determined that I would be satisfied with a thousand guineas So I put my poem in my pocket and set off for London My journey was joyous My heart was light as my purse and my head full of anticipations of fame and fortune With what swelling pride did I cast my eyes upon old London from,whashingtonIrving
re a little too late shouted Ben Haley with a sneer Just carry back my compliments to the old fool yonder and tell him I left in too great a hurry to give him my note for the gold he kindly lent me I ll attend to it when I get ready He had hitherto sculled the boat Now he took the other oar and commenced rowing But here the wound of which he had at first been scarcely conscious began to be felt and the first vigorous stroke brought a sharp twinge besides increasing the flow of blood His natural ferocity was stimulated by his unpleasant discovery and he shook his fist menacingly at Robert from whom he had received the wound There s a reckoning coming betwixt you and me young one he cried and it ll be a heavy one Ben Haley don t forget that sort of debt The time ll come when he ll pay it back with interest It mayn t come for years but it ll come at last you may be sure of that Finding that he could not row on account of his wound he rose to his feet and sculled the boat across as well as he could with one hand I wish I had another boat said Robert We could soon overtake him Better let him go said the neighbor He was always a bad one that Ben Haley I couldn t begin to tell you all the bad things he did when he was a boy He was a regular dare devil You must look out for him or he ll do you a mischief some time to pay for that wound He brought it on himself said Robert I gave him warning He went back to the farmhouse to tell Paul of his nephew s escape He was brave and bold but the malignant glance with which Ben Haley uttered his menace gave him a vague sense of discomfort CHAPTER XIII REVENGE In spite of his wounded arm Ben Haley succeeded in propelling the boat to the opposite shore The blood was steadily though slowly flowing from his wound and had already stained his shirt red for a considerable space In the excitement of first receiving it he had not felt the pain now however the wound began to pain him and as might be expected his feeling of animosity toward our hero was not diminished That cursed boy he muttered between his teeth I wish I had had time to give him one blow he wouldn t have wanted another I hope the wound isn t serious if it is I may have paid dear for the gold Still the thought of the gold in his pockets afforded some satisfaction He had been penniless now he was the possessor of as near as he could estimate for he had not had time to count five hundred dollars in gold That was more than he had ever possessed before at one time and would enable him to live at ease for a while On reaching the shore he was about to leave the boat to its fate when he espied a boy standing at a little distance with a hatchet in his hand This gave him an idea Come here boy he said The boy came forward and examined the stranger with curiosity Is that your hatchet he asked No sir It belongs to my father Would you mind selling it to me if I will give you money enough to buy a new one This is an old hatchet It will suit me just as well and I haven t time to buy another Would your father sell it Yes sir I guess so Very well What will a new one cost you The boy named the price Here is the money and twenty five cents more to pay you for your trouble in going to the store The boy pocketed the money with satisfaction He was a farmer s son and seldom had any money in his possession He already had twenty five cents saved up toward the purchase of a junior ball and the stranger s gratuity would just make up the sum necessary to secure it He was in a hurry to make the purchase and accordingly no sooner had he received the money than he started at once for the village store His departure was satisfactory to Ben Haley who now had nothing to prevent his carrying out his plans I wanted to be revenged on the boy and now I know how he said I ll make some trouble for him with this hatchet He drew the boat up and fastened it Then he deliberately proceeded to cut away at the bottom with his newly acquired hatchet He had a strong arm and his blows were made more effective by triumphant malice The boat he supposed to belong to Robert and he was determined to spoil it He hacked away with such energy that soon there was a large hole in the bottom of the boat Not content with inflicting this damage he cut it in various other places until it presented an appearance very different from the neat stanch boat of which Will Paine had been so proud At length Ben stopped and contemplated the ruin he had wrought with malicious satisfaction That s the first instalment in my revenge he said I should like to see my young ferryman s face when he sees his boat again It ll cost him more than he ll ever get from my miserly uncle to repair it It serves him right for meddling with matters that don t concern him And now I must be getting away for my affectionate uncle will soon be raising a hue and cry after me if I m not very much mistaken He would like to have gone at once to obtain medical assistance for his,horatioAlger
fellow Tell me is he silly too I think he is Why asked Gabriel Because he never tires of mocking me but does it all day long Why don t you come Where Upstairs He wants you Stay where s HIS shadow Come You re a wise man tell me that Beside him Barnaby beside him I suppose returned the locksmith No he replied shaking his head Guess again Gone out a walking maybe He has changed shadows with a woman the idiot whispered in his ear and then fell back with a look of triumph Her shadow s always with him and his with her That s sport I think eh Barnaby said the locksmith with a grave look come hither lad I know what you want to say I know he replied keeping away from him But I m cunning I m silent I only say so much to you are you ready As he spoke he caught up the light and waved it with a wild laugh above his head Softly gently said the locksmith exerting all his influence to keep him calm and quiet I thought you had been asleep So I HAVE been asleep he rejoined with widely opened eyes There have been great faces coming and going close to my face and then a mile away low places to creep through whether I would or no high churches to fall down from strange creatures crowded up together neck and heels to sit upon the bed that s sleep eh Dreams Barnaby dreams said the locksmith Dreams he echoed softly drawing closer to him Those are not dreams What are replied the locksmith if they are not I dreamed said Barnaby passing his arm through Varden s and peering close into his face as he answered in a whisper I dreamed just now that something it was in the shape of a man followed me came softly after me wouldn t let me be but was always hiding and crouching like a cat in dark corners waiting till I should pass when it crept out and came softly after me Did you ever see me run Many a time you know You never saw me run as I did in this dream Still it came creeping on to worry me Nearer nearer nearer I ran faster leaped sprung out of bed and to the window and there in the street below but he is waiting for us Are you coming What in the street below Barnaby said Varden imagining that he traced some connection between this vision and what had actually occurred Barnaby looked into his face muttered incoherently waved the light above his head again laughed and drawing the locksmith s arm more tightly through his own led him up the stairs in silence They entered a homely bedchamber garnished in a scanty way with chairs whose spindle shanks bespoke their age and other furniture of very little worth but clean and neatly kept Reclining in an easy chair before the fire pale and weak from waste of blood was Edward Chester the young gentleman who had been the first to quit the Maypole on the previous night and who extending his hand to the locksmith welcomed him as his preserver and friend Say no more sir say no more said Gabriel I hope I would have done at least as much for any man in such a strait and most of all for you sir A certain young lady he added with some hesitation has done us many a kind turn and we naturally feel I hope I give you no offence in saying this sir The young man smiled and shook his head at the same time moving in his chair as if in pain It s no great matter he said in answer to the locksmith s sympathising look a mere uneasiness arising at least as much from being cooped up here as from the slight wound I have or from the loss of blood Be seated Mr Varden If I may make so bold Mr Edward as to lean upon your chair returned the locksmith accommodating his action to his speech and bending over him I ll stand here for the convenience of speaking low Barnaby is not in his quietest humour to night and at such times talking never does him good They both glanced at the subject of this remark who had taken a seat on the other side of the fire and smiling vacantly was making puzzles on his fingers with a skein of string Pray tell me sir said Varden dropping his voice still lower exactly what happened last night I have my reason for inquiring You left the Maypole alone And walked homeward alone until I had nearly reached the place where you found me when I heard the gallop of a horse Behind you said the locksmith Indeed yes behind me It was a single rider who soon overtook me and checking his horse inquired the way to London You were on the alert sir knowing how many highwaymen there are scouring the roads in all directions said Varden I was but I had only a stick having imprudently left my pistols in their holster case with the landlord s son I directed him as he desired Before the words had passed my lips he rode upon me furiously as if bent on trampling me down beneath his horse s hoofs In starting aside I slipped and fell You found me with this stab and an ugly bruise or two and without my purse in which he found little enough for his pains And now Mr Varden he added shaking the locksmith by the hand saving the extent of my gratitude to you you know as much as I Except said Gabriel bending down yet more and looking cautiously towards their silent neighhour except in respect of the robber himself What like was he,charlesDickens
Ryan s drove the last inch he ll ever drive in this darned town If they pinch me again it ll have to be fer walkin The Little Woman looked at him pressed her lips together and moved behind the wheel She did not say a word all the way out to the white apartment house on Vermont which held the four rooms they called home She parked the car dexterously in front and led the way to their apartment ground floor front before she looked at me It s coming to a show down Jack she said then with a faint smile He s on probation already for disobeying traffic rules of one sort and other and his fines cost more than the entire upkeep of the car I think he really will have to go to jail this time It just isn t in Casey Ryan to take orders from any one especially when his own personal habits of driving a car are concerned Town life is getting on his nerves I tried to defend Casey and at the same time to comfort the Little Woman I didn t think it would work his coming here to live with nothing to do but spend money This is the inevitable result of too much money and too much leisure It sounds much better putting it that way murmured Mrs Casey I think you re right though he did behave back there as if it were too much matrimony Jack he s been looking forward to your visit I m sorry this has happened to spoil it It isn t spoiled I grinned Casey Ryan is always and ever shall be Casey Ryan He s running true to form though tamer than one would expect When do you think he ll show up Mrs Casey did not know She ventured a guess or two but there was no conviction in her tone With two nominal arrests in five minutes chalked against him and with his first rebellion against the Little Woman to rankle in his conscience and memory she owned herself at a loss With a cheerfulness that was only conversation deep we waited for Casey and finally ate supper without him The evening was enlivened somewhat by Babe s chatter of kindergarten doings and was punctuated by certain pauses while steps on the sidewalk passed on or ended with the closing of another door than the Ryans I fought the impulse to call up the police station and I caught the eyes of the Little Woman straying unconsciously to the telephone in the hall while she talked of things remote from our inner thoughts Margaret Ryan is game I ll say that We played cribbage for an hour or two and the Little Woman beat me until finally I threw up my hands and quit I can t stand it any longer Mrs Casey Do you think he s in jail or just sulking at a movie somewhere I blurted Forgive my butting in but I wish you d talk about it You know you can to me Casey Ryan is a friend and more than a friend he s a pet theory of mine a fad if you prefer to call him that I consider him a perfect example of human nature in its unhampered unbiased state going straight through life without deviating a hair s breadth from the viewpoint of youth A fighter and a castle builder a sort of rough edged Peter Pan Till he gums soft food and hobbles with a stick because the years have warped his back and his legs Casey Ryan will keep that indefinable bubbling optimism of spiritual youth So tell me all about him I want to know who has licked so far luxury or Casey Ryan The Little Woman laughed and picked up the cards evening their edges with sensitive fingers that had not been manicured so beautifully when first I saw them Well sir she drawled making one word of the two and failing to keep a little twitching from her lips I think it s been about a tie so far As a husband Casey s a darned good bachelor Her chuckle robbed that statement of anything approaching criticism Aside from his insisting on cooking breakfast every morning and feeding me in bed forcing me to eat fried eggs and sour dough hotcakes swimming in butter and honey when I crave grapefruit and thin toast and one French lamb chop with a white paper frill on the handle and garnished with fresh parsley he s the soul of consideration He wants four kinds of jam on the table every meal when fresh fruit is going to waste He s bullied the laundryman until the poor fellow s reached the point where he won t stop if the car s parked in front and Casey s liable to be home but aside from that Casey s all right After serving time in the desert and rustling my own wood and living on bacon and beans and sour dough bread I m perfectly willing to spend the rest of my life doing painless housekeeping with all the modern built in features ever invented and buying my bread and cakes and salads from the delicatessen around the corner I never want to see a sagebush again as long as I live or feel the crunch of gravel under my feet I expect to die in French heeled pumps and embroidered silk stockings and the finest silliest silk things ever put in a show window to tempt the soul of a woman But it took just two weeks and three days to drive Casey back to his sour dough can He craved luxury more than you seemed to do I remembered aloud He did yes But his idea of luxury is sitting down in the kitchen to a real meal of beans and biscuits and all the known varieties of jam,bmBower
of my own These would have been of great assistance at such times in using the sweeps as well as afterward in fishing but somehow although we ran the risk ourselves we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger for after all is said and done it was a horrible danger and that is the truth It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell you occurred It was on the tenth day of July a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens And yet all the morning and indeed until late in the afternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south west while the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow The three of us my two brothers and myself had crossed over to the islands about two o clock P M and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that day than we had ever known them It was just seven by my watch when we weighed and started for home so as to make the worst of the Str m at slack water which we knew would be at eight We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some time spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen This was most unusual something that had never happened to us before and I began to feel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why We put the boat on the wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and I was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when looking astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and we were dead becalmed drifting about in every direction This state of things however did not last long enough to give us time to think about it In less than a minute the storm was upon us in less than two the sky was entirely overcast and what with this and the driving spray it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the first puff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashed himself to it for safety Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water It had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the bow and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the Str m by way of precaution against the chopping seas But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once for we lay entirely buried for some moments How my elder brother escaped destruction I can not say for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining For my part as soon as I had let the foresail run I threw myself flat on deck with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands grasping a ring bolt near the foot of the fore mast It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done for I was too much flurried to think For some moments we were completely deluged as I say and all this time I held my breath and clung to the bolt When I could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my hands and thus got my head clear Presently our little boat gave herself a shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and thus rid herself in some measure of the seas I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done when I felt somebody grasp my arm It was my elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for I had made sure that he was overboard but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror for he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the word Moskoe str m No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague I knew what he meant by that one word well enough I knew what he wished to make me understand With the wind that now drove us on we were bound for the whirl of the Str m and nothing could save us You perceive that in crossing the Str m channel we always went a long way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack but now we were driving right upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this To be sure I thought we shall get there just about the slack there is some little hope in that but in the next moment I cursed,allanPoe
gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne of which this was the most consoling that it would soon be over And it was soon over In two minutes after Charles s preparation the others appeared they were in the drawing room Her eye half met Captain Wentworth s a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to Mary said all that was right said something to the Miss Musgroves enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it Charles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the Miss Musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could It is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude The worst is over Mary talked but she could not attend She had seen him They had met They had been once more in the same room Soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less Eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness What might not eight years do Events of every description changes alienations removals all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past how natural how certain too It included nearly a third part of her own life Alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing Now how were his sentiments to be read Was this like wishing to avoid her And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you Anne though he was so attentive to me Henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said You were so altered he should not have known you again Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister s in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound Altered beyond his knowledge Anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification Doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse She had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would No the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth So altered that he should not have known her again These were words which could not but dwell with her Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them They were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier Frederick Wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her He had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt He had not forgiven Anne Elliot She had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure She had given him up to oblige others It had been the effect of over persuasion It had been weakness and timidity He had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again Her power with him was gone for ever It was now his object to marry He was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting Anne Elliot This was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions Yes here I am Sophia quite ready to make a foolish match Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking A little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and I am a lost man Should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice He said it she knew to be contradicted His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with A strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description That is the woman I want said he Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with but it must not be much If I am a fool I shall be a fool indeed for I have thought on the subject more than most men Chapter From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove s for the,janeAusten
trade illegal A year later the United States followed suit but although on the seas her frigates chased the slavers on shore a part of our people continued to hold slaves until the Civil War rescued both them and the slaves As early as Raynal and Diderot estimated that up to that time there had been exported from Africa to the North and South Americas nine million slaves Our own historian Bancroft calculated that in the eighteenth century the English alone imported to the Americas three million slaves while another purchased or kidnapped on the West Coast were lost in the surf or on the voyage thrown into the sea For that number Bancroft places the gross returns as not far from four hundred millions of dollars All this is history and to the reader familiar but I do not apologize for reviewing it here as without the background of the slave trade the West Coast as it is to day is difficult to understand As we have seen to kings to chartered Merchant Adventurers to the cotton planters of the West Indies and of our South and to the men of the North who traded in black ivory the West Coast gave vast fortunes The price was the lives of millions of slaves And to day it almost seems as though the sins of the fathers were being visited upon the children as though the juju of the African under the spell of which his enemies languish and die has been cast upon the white man We have to look only at home In the millions of dead and in the misery of the Civil War and to day in race hatred in race riots in monstrous crimes and as monstrous lynchings we seem to see the fetish of the West Coast the curse falling upon the children to the third and fourth generation of the million slaves that were thrown shackled into the sea The first mention in history of Sierra Leone is when in B C Hanno the Carthaginian anchored at night in its harbor and then owing to fires in the forests the beating of drums and strange cries that issued from the bushes before daylight hastened away We now skip nineteen hundred years This is something of a gap but except for the sketchy description given us by Hanno of the place and his one gaudy night there Sierra Leone until the fifteenth century utterly disappears from the knowledge of man Happy is the country without a history Nineteen hundred years having now supposed to elapse the second act begins with De Cintra who came in search of slaves and instead gave the place its name Because of the roaring of the wind around the peak that rises over the harbor he called it the Lion Mountain After the fifteenth century in a succession of failures five different companies of Royal Adventurers were chartered to trade with her people and when convenient to kidnap them pirates in turn kidnapped the British governor the French and Dutch were always at war with the settlement and native raids epidemics and fevers were continuous The history of Sierra Leone is the history of every other colony along the West Coast with the difference that it became a colony by purchase and was not as were the others a trading station gradually converted into a colony During the war in America Great Britain offered freedom to all slaves that would fight for her and after the war these freed slaves were conveyed on ships of war to London where they were soon destitute They appealed to the great friend of the slave in those days Granville Sharp and he with others shipped them to Sierra Leone to establish with the aid of some white emigrants an independent colony which was to be a refuge and sanctuary for others like themselves Liberia which was the gift of philanthropists of Baltimore to American freed slaves was no doubt inspired by this earlier effort The colony became a refuge for slaves from every part of the Coast the West Indies and Nova Scotia and to day in that one colony there are spoken sixty different coast dialects and those of the hinterland Sierra Leone as originally purchased in consisted of twenty square miles for which among other articles of equal value King Naimbanna received a crimson satin embroidered waistcoat one puncheon of rum ten pounds of beads two cheeses one box of smoking pipes a mock diamond ring and a tierce of pork What first impressed me about Sierra Leone was the heat It does not permit one to give his attention wholly to anything else I always have maintained that the hottest place on earth is New York and I have been in other places with more than a local reputation for heat some along the Equator Louren o Marquez which is only prevented from being an earthen oven because it is a swamp the Red Sea with a following breeze and from both shores the baked heat of the desert and Nagasaki on a rainy day in midsummer But New York in August radiating stored up heat from iron framed buildings with the foul dead air shut in by the skyscrapers with a humidity that makes you think you are breathing through a steam heated sponge is as near the lower regions as I hope any of us will go And yet Sierra Leone is no mean competitor We climbed the moss covered steps to the quay to face a great white building that blazed like the base of a whitewashed stove at white heat Before it were some rusty cannon and a canoe cut out of a single tree and seated upon it selling fruit and sun dried fish some native women naked to the waist their bodies streaming with palm oil and sweat At the same moment something struck me a blow on the top of the head,richardHarding
the affair in some measure compensated James s women folk for the ruthless negation of all their patient effort and skilled diplomacy It was rather trying to have to deflect their enthusiasm at a moment s notice from Joan Sebastable to Rhoda Ellam but after all it was James s wife who was in question and his tastes had some claim to be considered On a September afternoon of the same year after the honeymoon in Minorca had ended Cushat Prinkly came into the drawing room of his new house in Granchester Square Rhoda was seated at a low table behind a service of dainty porcelain and gleaming silver There was a pleasant tinkling note in her voice as she handed him a cup You like it weaker than that don t you Shall I put some more hot water to it No THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CRISPINA UMBERLEIGH In a first class carriage of a train speeding Balkanward across the flat green Hungarian plain two Britons sat in friendly fitful converse They had first foregathered in the cold grey dawn at the frontier line where the presiding eagle takes on an extra head and Teuton lands pass from Hohenzollern to Habsburg keeping and where a probing official beak requires to delve in polite and perhaps perfunctory but always tiresome manner into the baggage of sleep hungry passengers After a day s break of their journey at Vienna the travellers had again foregathered at the trainside and paid one another the compliment of settling instinctively into the same carriage The elder of the two had the appearance and manner of a diplomat in point of fact he was the well connected foster brother of a wine business The other was certainly a journalist Neither man was talkative and each was grateful to the other for not being talkative That is why from time to time they talked One topic of conversation naturally thrust itself forward in front of all others In Vienna the previous day they had learned of the mysterious vanishing of a world famous picture from the walls of the Louvre A dramatic disappearance of that sort is sure to produce a crop of imitations said the Journalist It has had a lot of anticipations for the matter of that said the Wine brother Oh of course there have been thefts from the Louvre before I was thinking of the spiriting away of human beings rather than pictures In particular I was thinking of the case of my aunt Crispina Umberleigh I remember hearing something of the affair said the Journalist but I was away from England at the time I never quite knew what was supposed to have happened You may hear what really happened if you will respect it as a confidence said the Wine Merchant In the first place I may say that the disappearance of Mrs Umberleigh was not regarded by the family entirely as a bereavement My uncle Edward Umberleigh was not by any means a weak kneed individual in fact in the world of politics he had to be reckoned with more or less as a strong man but he was unmistakably dominated by Crispina indeed I never met any human being who was not frozen into subjection when brought into prolonged contact with her Some people are born to command Crispina Mrs Umberleigh was born to legislate codify administrate censor license ban execute and sit in judgement generally If she was not born with that destiny she adopted it at an early age From the kitchen regions upwards every one in the household came under her despotic sway and stayed there with the submissiveness of molluscs involved in a glacial epoch As a nephew on a footing of only occasional visits she affected me merely as an epidemic disagreeable while it lasted but without any permanent effect but her own sons and daughters stood in mortal awe of her their studies friendships diet amusements religious observances and way of doing their hair were all regulated and ordained according to the august lady s will and pleasure This will help you to understand the sensation of stupefaction which was caused in the family when she unobtrusively and inexplicably vanished It was as though St Paul s Cathedral or the Piccadilly Hotel had disappeared in the night leaving nothing but an open space to mark where it had stood As far as was known nothing was troubling her in fact there was much before her to make life particularly well worth living The youngest boy had come back from school with an unsatisfactory report and she was to have sat in judgement on him the very afternoon of the day she disappeared if it had been he who had vanished in a hurry one could have supplied the motive Then she was in the middle of a newspaper correspondence with a rural dean in which she had already proved him guilty of heresy inconsistency and unworthy quibbling and no ordinary consideration would have induced her to discontinue the controversy Of course the matter was put in the hands of the police but as far as possible it was kept out of the papers and the generally accepted explanation of her withdrawal from her social circle was that she had gone into a nursing home And what was the immediate effect on the home circle asked the Journalist All the girls bought themselves bicycles the feminine cycling craze was still in existence and Crispina had rigidly vetoed any participation in it among the members of her household The youngest boy let himself go to such an extent during his next term that it had to be his last as far as that particular establishment was concerned The elder boys propounded a theory that their mother might be wandering somewhere abroad and searched for her assiduously chiefly it must be admitted in a class of Montmartre resort where it was extremely improbable that she would be,hectorMunro
of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me To watch teach form little Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at night her small white bed being already arranged to that end in my room What I had undertaken was the whole care of her and she had remained just this last time with Mrs Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity In spite of this timidity which the child herself in the oddest way in the world had been perfectly frank and brave about allowing it without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness with the deep sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael s holy infants to be discussed to be imputed to her and to determine us I feel quite sure she would presently like me It was part of what I already liked Mrs Grose herself for the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil in a high chair and a bib brightly facing me between them over bread and milk There were naturally things that in Flora s presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks obscure and roundabout allusions And the little boy does he look like her Is he too so very remarkable One wouldn t flatter a child Oh miss most remarkable If you think well of this one and she stood there with a plate in her hand beaming at our companion who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us Yes if I do You will be carried away by the little gentleman Well that I think is what I came for to be carried away I m afraid however I remember feeling the impulse to add I m rather easily carried away I was carried away in London I can still see Mrs Grose s broad face as she took this in In Harley Street In Harley Street Well miss you re not the first and you won t be the last Oh I ve no pretension I could laugh to being the only one My other pupil at any rate as I understand comes back tomorrow Not tomorrow Friday miss He arrives as you did by the coach under care of the guard and is to be met by the same carriage I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister an idea in which Mrs Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge never falsified thank heaven that we should on every question be quite at one Oh she was glad I was there What I felt the next day was I suppose nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale as I walked round them gazed up at them took them in of my new circumstances They had as it were an extent and mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself freshly a little scared as well as a little proud Lessons in this agitation certainly suffered some delay I reflected that my first duty was by the gentlest arts I could contrive to win the child into the sense of knowing me I spent the day with her out of doors I arranged with her to her great satisfaction that it should be she she only who might show me the place She showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret with droll delightful childish talk about it and with the result in half an hour of our becoming immense friends Young as she was I was struck throughout our little tour with her confidence and courage with the way in empty chambers and dull corridors on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy her morning music her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked rang out and led me on I have not seen Bly since the day I left it and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted But as my little conductress with her hair of gold and her frock of blue danced before me round corners and pattered down passages I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite such a place as would somehow for diversion of the young idea take all color out of storybooks and fairytales Wasn t it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and adream No it was a big ugly antique but convenient house embodying a few features of a building still older half replaced and half utilized in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship Well I was strangely at the helm II This came home to me when two days later I drove over with Flora to meet as Mrs Grose said the little gentleman and all the more for an incident that presenting itself the second evening had deeply disconcerted me The first day had been on the whole as I have expressed reassuring but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension The postbag that evening it came,henryJames
one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms and lugged it straight up a tree trunk A brown spotted lady bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade and Tom bent down close to it and said Lady bug lady bug fly away home your house is on fire your children s alone and she took wing and went off to see about it which did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once A tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at its ball and Tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead The birds were fairly rioting by this time A catbird the Northern mocker lit in a tree over Tom s head and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stopped on a twig almost within the boy s reach cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not All Nature was wide awake and stirring now long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted and ravenous and they soon had the camp fire blazing up again Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute they stepped to a promising nook in the river bank and threw in their lines almost immediately they had reward Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass a couple of sun perch and a small catfish provisions enough for quite a family They fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before They did not know that the quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping open air exercise bathing and a large ingredient of hunger make too They lay around in the shade after breakfast while Huck had a smoke and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition They tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape vines Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers They found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be astonished at They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide They took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp They were too hungry to stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk But the talk soon began to drag and then died The stillness the solemnity that brooded in the woods and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the spirits of the boys They fell to thinking A sort of undefined longing crept upon them This took dim shape presently it was budding homesickness Even Finn the Red Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads But they were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak his thought For some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced and forced a recognition The boys started glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude There was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came floating down out of the distance What is it exclaimed Joe under his breath I wonder said Tom in a whisper Tain t thunder said Huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder Hark said Tom Listen don t talk They waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush Let s go and see They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water The little steam ferry boat was about a mile below the village drifting with the current Her broad deck seemed,markTwain
know Well we re bound to take you on your own terms said the inspector but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case For the simple reason my dear Mr Mac that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating We are investigating the murder of Mr John Douglas of Birlstone Manor Yes yes so you are But don t trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle I assure you that it won t help you Then what do you suggest that we do I will tell you exactly what to do if you will do it Well I m bound to say I ve always found you had reason behind all your queer ways I ll do what you advise And you Mr White Mason The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other Holmes and his methods were new to him Well if it is good enough for the inspector it is good enough for me he said at last Capital said Holmes Well then I should recommend a nice cheery country walk for both of you They tell me that the views from Birlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable No doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one In the evening tired but happy Man this is getting past a joke cried MacDonald rising angrily from his chair Well well spend the day as you like said Holmes patting him cheerfully upon the shoulder Do what you like and go where you will but meet me here before dusk without fail without fail Mr Mac That sounds more like sanity All of it was excellent advice but I don t insist so long as you are here when I need you But now before we part I want you to write a note to Mr Barker Well I ll dictate it if you like Ready Dear Sir It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat in the hope that we may find some It s impossible said the inspector I ve made inquiry Tut tut My dear sir please do what I ask you Well go on in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation I have made arrangements and the workmen will be at work early to morrow morning diverting the stream Impossible diverting the stream so I thought it best to explain matters beforehand Now sign that and send it by hand about four o clock At that hour we shall meet again in this room Until then we may each do what we like for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause Evening was drawing in when we reassembled Holmes was very serious in his manner myself curious and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed Well gentlemen said my friend gravely I am asking you now to put everything to the test with me and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I have come It is a chill evening and I do not know how long our expedition may last so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark so with your permission we shall get started at once We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it Through this we slipped and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge The latter had not been raised Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels and we all three followed his example Well what are we to do now asked MacDonald with some gruffness Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible Holmes answered What are we here for at all I really think that you might treat us with more frankness Holmes laughed Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life said he Some touch of the artist wells up within me and calls insistently for a well staged performance Surely our profession Mr Mac would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results The blunt accusation the brutal tap upon the shoulder what can one make of such a denouement But the quick inference the subtle trap the clever forecast of coming events the triumphant vindication of bold theories are these not the pride and the justification of our life s work At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable I only ask a little patience Mr Mac and all will be clear to you Well I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold said the London detective with comic resignation We all had good reason to join in the aspiration for our vigil was a long and bitter one Slowly the shadows darkened over the long sombre face of the old house A cold damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering There was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study Everything else was dark and still How long is this to last asked the inspector finally And what is it we are watching for I have no more notion than you,arthurDoyle
islands The natives of Nukuheva would frequently recount in pantomime to our ship s company their terrible feats and would show the marks of wounds they had received in desperate encounters with them When ashore they would try to frighten us by pointing to one of their own number and calling him a Typee manifesting no little surprise that we did not take to our heels at so terrible an announcement It was quite amusing too to see with what earnestness they disclaimed all cannibal propensities on their own part while they denounced their enemies the Typees as inveterate gourmandizers of human flesh but this is a peculiarity to which I shall hereafter have occasion to allude Although I was convinced that the inhabitants of our bay were as arrant cannibals as any of the other tribes on the island still I could not but feel a particular and most unqualified repugnance to the aforesaid Typees Even before visiting the Marquesas I had heard from men who had touched at the group on former voyages some revolting stories in connection with these savages and fresh in my remembrance was the adventure of the master of the Katherine who only a few months previous imprudently venturing into this bay in an armed boat for the purpose of barter was seized by the natives carried back a little distance into their valley and was only saved from a cruel death by the intervention of a young girl who facilitated his escape by night along the beach to Nukuheva I had heard too of an English vessel that many years ago after a weary cruise sought to enter the bay of Nukuheva and arriving within two or three miles of the land was met by a large canoe filled with natives who offered to lead the way to the place of their destination The captain unacquainted with the localities of the island joyfully acceded to the proposition the canoe paddled on the ship followed She was soon conducted to a beautiful inlet and dropped her anchor in its waters beneath the shadows of the lofty shore That same night the perfidious Typees who had thus inveigled her into their fatal bay flocked aboard the doomed vessel by hundreds and at a given signal murdered every soul on board I shall never forget the observation of one of our crew as we were passing slowly by the entrance of the bay in our way to Nukuheva As we stood gazing over the side at the verdant headlands Ned pointing with his hand in the direction of the treacherous valley exclaimed There there s Typee Oh the bloody cannibals what a meal they d make of us if we were to take it into our heads to land but they say they don t like sailor s flesh it s too salt I say maty how should you like to be shoved ashore there eh I little thought as I shuddered at the question that in the space of a few weeks I should actually be a captive in that self same valley The French although they had gone through the ceremony of hoisting their colours for a few hours at all the principal places of the group had not as yet visited the bay of Typee anticipating a fierce resistance on the part of the savages there which for the present at least they wished to avoid Perhaps they were not a little influenced in the adoption of this unusual policy from a recollection of the warlike reception given by the Typees to the forces of Captain Porter about the year when that brave and accomplished officer endeavoured to subjugate the clan merely to gratify the mortal hatred of his allies the Nukuhevas and Happars On that occasion I have been told that a considerable detachment of sailors and marines from the frigate Essex accompanied by at least two thousand warriors of Happar and Nukuheva landed in boats and canoes at the head of the bay and after penetrating a little distance into the valley met with the stoutest resistance from its inmates Valiantly although with much loss the Typees disputed every inch of ground and after some hard fighting obliged their assailants to retreat and abandon their design of conquest The invaders on their march back to the sea consoled themselves for their repulse by setting fire to every house and temple in their route and a long line of smoking ruins defaced the once smiling bosom of the valley and proclaimed to its pagan inhabitants the spirit that reigned in the breasts of Christian soldiers Who can wonder at the deadly hatred of the Typees to all foreigners after such unprovoked atrocities Thus it is that they whom we denominate savages are made to deserve the title When the inhabitants of some sequestered island first descry the big canoe of the European rolling through the blue waters towards their shores they rush down to the beach in crowds and with open arms stand ready to embrace the strangers Fatal embrace They fold to their bosom the vipers whose sting is destined to poison all their joys and the instinctive feeling of love within their breast is soon converted into the bitterest hate The enormities perpetrated in the South Seas upon some of the inoffensive islanders will nigh pass belief These things are seldom proclaimed at home they happen at the very ends of the earth they are done in a corner and there are none to reveal them But there is nevertheless many a petty trader that has navigated the Pacific whose course from island to island might be traced by a series of cold blooded robberies kidnappings and murders the iniquity of which

he was the holy woman gathered round him kissing his hands and begging his blessing When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the Princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter The slave said it was the holy woman curing people by her touch of their ailments whereupon the Princess who had long desired to see Fatima sent for her On coming to the Princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity When he had done the Princess made him sit by her and begged him to stay with her always The false Fatima who wished for nothing better consented but kept his veil down for fear of discovery The Princess showed him the hall and asked him what he thought of it It is truly beautiful said the false Fatima In my mind it wants but one thing And what is that said the Princess If only a roc s egg replied he were hung up from the middle of this dome it would be the wonder of the world After this the Princess could think of nothing but the roc s egg and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor He begged to know what was amiss and she told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoiled for the want of a roc s egg hanging from the dome If that is all replied Aladdin you shall soon be happy He left her and rubbed the lamp and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a roc s egg The genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that the hall shook Wretch he cried is it not enough that I have done everything for you but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome You and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes but that this request does not come from you but from the brother of the African magician whom you destroyed He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman whom he murdered He it was who put that wish into your wife s head Take care of yourself for he means to kill you So saying the genie disappeared Aladdin went back to the Princess saying his head ached and requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it But when the magician came near Aladdin seizing his dagger pierced him to the heart What have you done cried the Princess You have killed the holy woman Not so replied Aladdin but a wicked magician and told her of how she had been deceived After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace He succeeded the Sultan when he died and reigned for many years leaving behind him a long line of kings Arabian Nights THE TALE OF A YOUTH WHO SET OUT TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS A father had two sons of whom the eldest was clever and bright and always knew what he was about but the youngest was stupid and couldn t learn or understand anything So much so that those who saw him exclaimed What a burden he ll be to his father Now when there was anything to be done the eldest had always to do it but if something was required later or in the night time and the way led through the churchyard or some such ghostly place he always replied Oh no father nothing will induce me to go there it makes me shudder for he was afraid Or when they sat of an evening around the fire telling stories which made one s flesh creep the listeners sometimes said Oh it makes one shudder the youngest sat in a corner heard the exclamation and could not understand what it meant They are always saying it makes one shudder it makes one shudder Nothing makes me shudder It s probably an art quite beyond me Now it happened that his father said to him one day Hearken you there in the corner you are growing big and strong and you must learn to earn your own bread Look at your brother what pains he takes but all the money I ve spent on your education is thrown away My dear father he replied I will gladly learn in fact if it were possible I should like to learn to shudder I don t understand that a bit yet The eldest laughed when he heard this and thought to himself Good heavens what a ninny my brother is he ll never come to any good as the twig is bent so is the tree inclined The father sighed and answered him You ll soon learn to shudder but that won t help you to make a living Shortly after this when the sexton came to pay them a visit the father broke out to him and told him what a bad hand his youngest son was at everything he knew nothing and learned nothing Only think when I asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood he actually asked to be taught to shudder If that s all he wants said the sexton I can teach him that just you send him to me I ll soon polish him up The father was quite pleased with the proposal because he thought It will be a good discipline for the youth And so the sexton took him into his house and his duty was to toll the bell After a few days he woke him at midnight and bade him rise and climb into the tower and toll Now my friend I ll teach you to shudder thought he He stole forth secretly in front and when the youth was up above and had turned round,andrewLang
we must do them ourselves said the other for you must help me if you stay Well my hat is gone however continued the younger It went over the hedge I think The idea of such a slight wind catching it The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed and was encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red as absolutely uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour her long back being mathematically level The other was spotted grey and white Beside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old looking idiotically at the two women which showed that it had not long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight and often turning to the lantern which it apparently mistook for the moon inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe Hill lately I think we had better send for some oatmeal said the elder woman there s no more bran Yes aunt and I ll ride over for it as soon as it is light But there s no side saddle I can ride on the other trust me Oak upon hearing these remarks became more curious to observe her features but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak and by his a rial position he felt himself drawing upon his fancy for their details In making even horizontal and clear inspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us whatever our eyes bring in Had Gabriel been able from the first to get a distinct view of her countenance his estimate of it as very handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him his position moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy he painted her a beauty By one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature like a busy mother seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn and make her children smile the girl now dropped the cloak and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon myrtles and looking glass prosily as the woman who owed him twopence They placed the calf beside its mother again took up the lantern and went out the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula Gabriel Oak returned to his flock CHAPTER III A GIRL ON HORSEBACK CONVERSATION The sluggish day began to break Even its position terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest and for no particular reason save that the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again into the plantation Lingering and musing here he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on its back ascending by the path leading past the cattle shed She was the young woman of the night before Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind possibly she had come to look for it He hastily scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among the leaves Gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut Here he ensconced himself and peeped through the loophole in the direction of the rider s approach She came up and looked around then on the other side of the hedge Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an unexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for the present The path after passing the cowshed bisected the plantation It was not a bridle path merely a pedestrian s track and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them The girl who wore no riding habit looked around for a moment as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony s back her head over its tail her feet against its shoulders and her eyes to the sky The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher its noiselessness that of a hawk Gabriel s eyes had scarcely been able to follow her The tall lank pony seemed used to such doings and ambled along unconcerned Thus she passed under the level boughs The performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse s head and its tail and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the passage of the plantation she began to adopt another even more obviously convenient than the first She had no side saddle and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways Springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling and satisfying herself that nobody was in sight she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle though hardly expected of the woman and trotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill Oak was amused perhaps a little astonished and hanging up the hat in his hut went again among his ewes An hour passed the girl returned properly seated now with a bag of bran in front of her On nearing the cattle shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking pail who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off The boy led away the horse leaving the pail with the young woman Soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular succession

than the old city states possible It made a continuous historical consciousness possible The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death It is interesting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used A king or a nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very artistically carved and would impress it on any clay document he wished to authorize So close had civilization got to printing six thousand years ago Then the clay was dried hard and became permanent For the reader must remember that in the land of

Photo D McLeish THE TEMPLE OF HATHOR AT DENDEREH THE TEMPLE OF HATHOR AT DENDEREH Photo D McLeish Daily life in those first city lands of the old world must have been very similar in both Egypt and Sumeria And except for the asses and cattle in the streets it must have been not unlike the life in the Maya cities of America three or four thousand years later Most of the people in peace time were busy with irrigation and cultivation except on days of religious festivity They had no money and no need for it They managed their small occasional trades by barter The princes and rulers who alone had more than a few possessions used gold and silver bars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade The temple dominated life in Sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up to a roof from which the stars were observed in Egypt it was a massive building with only a ground floor In Sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest most splendid of beings In Egypt however there was one who was raised above the priests he was the living incarnation of the chief god of the land the Pharaoh the god king There were few changes in the world in those days men s days were sunny toilsome and conventional Few strangers came into the land and such as did fared uncomfortably The priest directed life according to immemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and marked the omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the warnings of dreams Men worked and loved and died not unhappily forgetful of the savage past of their race and heedless of its future Sometimes the ruler was benign Such was Pepi II who reigned in Egypt for ninety years Sometimes he was ambitious and took men s sons to be soldiers and sent them against neighbouring city states to war and plunder or he made them toil to build great buildings Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus who built those vast sepulchral piles the pyramids at Gizeh The largest of these is feet high and the weight of stone in it is tons All this was brought down the Nile in boats and lugged into place chiefly by human muscle Its erection must have exhausted Egypt more than a great war would have done XVI PRIMITIVE NOMADIC PEOPLES It was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were settling down to agriculture and the formation of city states in the centuries between and B C Wherever there were possibilities of irrigation and a steady all the year round food supply men were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and wandering for the routines of settlement On the upper Tigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities in the valleys of Asia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and islands there were small communities growing up to civilization Possibly parallel developments of human life were already going on in favourable regions of India and China In many parts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish little communities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over the water and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting But over much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was possible The land was too harsh too thickly wooded or too arid or the seasons too uncertain for mankind with only the implements and science of that age to take root For settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men needed a constant water supply and warmth and sunshine Where these needs were not satisfied man could live as a transient as a hunter following his game as a herdsman following the seasonal grass but he could not settle The transition from the hunting to the herding life may have been very gradual From following herds of wild cattle or in Asia wild horses men may have come to an idea of property in

and bestows the whole measure of its hope or fear its exultation or sorrow on the fortunes of others between whom and itself this sympathy is the only bond Destiny it may be the most skilful of stage managers seldom chooses to arrange its scenes and carry forward its drama without securing the presence of at least one calm observer It is his office to give applause when due and sometimes an inevitable tear to detect the final fitness of incident to character and distil in his long brooding thought the whole morality of the performance Not to be out of the way in case there were need of me in my vocation and at the same time to avoid thrusting myself where neither destiny nor mortals might desire my presence I remained pretty near the verge of the woodlands My position was off the track of Zenobia s customary walk yet not so remote but that a recognized occasion might speedily have brought me thither XII COVERDALE S HERMITAGE Long since in this part of our circumjacent wood I had found out for myself a little hermitage It was a kind of leafy cave high upward into the air among the midmost branches of a white pine tree A wild grapevine of unusual size and luxuriance had twined and twisted itself up into the tree and after wreathing the entanglement of its tendrils around almost every bough had caught hold of three or four neighboring trees and married the whole clump with a perfectly inextricable knot of polygamy Once while sheltering myself from a summer shower the fancy had taken me to clamber up into this seemingly impervious mass of foliage The branches yielded me a passage and closed again beneath as if only a squirrel or a bird had passed Far aloft around the stem of the central pine behold a perfect nest for Robinson Crusoe or King Charles A hollow chamber of rare seclusion had been formed by the decay of some of the pine branches which the vine had lovingly strangled with its embrace burying them from the light of day in an aerial sepulchre of its own leaves It cost me but little ingenuity to enlarge the interior and open loopholes through the verdant walls Had it ever been my fortune to spend a honeymoon I should have thought seriously of inviting my bride up thither where our next neighbors would have been two orioles in another part of the clump It was an admirable place to make verses tuning the rhythm to the breezy symphony that so often stirred among the vine leaves or to meditate an essay for The Dial in which the many tongues of Nature whispered mysteries and seemed to ask only a little stronger puff of wind to speak out the solution of its riddle Being so pervious to air currents it was just the nook too for the enjoyment of a cigar This hermitage was my one exclusive possession while I counted myself a brother of the socialists It symbolized my individuality and aided me in keeping it inviolate None ever found me out in it except once a squirrel I brought thither no guest because after Hollingsworth failed me there was no longer the man alive with whom I could think of sharing all So there I used to sit owl like yet not without liberal and hospitable thoughts I counted the innumerable clusters of my vine and fore reckoned the abundance of my vintage It gladdened me to anticipate the surprise of the Community when like an allegorical figure of rich October I should make my appearance with shoulders bent beneath the burden of ripe grapes and some of the crushed ones crimsoning my brow as with a bloodstain Ascending into this natural turret I peeped in turn out of several of its small windows The pine tree being ancient rose high above the rest of the wood which was of comparatively recent growth Even where I sat about midway between the root and the topmost bough my position was lofty enough to serve as an observatory not for starry investigations but for those sublunary matters in which lay a lore as infinite as that of the planets Through one loophole I saw the river lapsing calmly onward while in the meadow near its brink a few of the brethren were digging peat for our winter s fuel On the interior cart road of our farm I discerned Hollingsworth with a yoke of oxen hitched to a drag of stones that were to be piled into a fence on which we employed ourselves at the odd intervals of other labor The harsh tones of his voice shouting to the sluggish steers made me sensible even at such a distance that he was ill at ease and that the balked philanthropist had the battle spirit in his heart Haw Buck quoth he Come along there ye lazy ones What are ye about now Gee Mankind in Hollingsworth s opinion thought I is but another yoke of oxen as stubborn stupid and sluggish as our old Brown and Bright He vituperates us aloud and curses us in his heart and will begin to prick us with the goad stick by and by But are we his oxen And what right has he to be the driver And why when there is enough else to do should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load of his philanthropic absurdities At my height above the earth the whole matter looks ridiculous Turning towards the farmhouse I saw Priscilla for though a great way off the eye of faith assured me that it was she sitting at Zenobia s window and making little purses I suppose or perhaps mending the Community s old linen A bird flew past my tree and as it clove its way onward into the sunny atmosphere I flung it a message for Priscilla Tell her,nathanielHawthorne

your power honestly and unselfishly He is so stricken down and the manner of it is so mysterious that I can not but think that it is in some way a result of his own work That he calculated on some set back is manifest to us all God knows I am willing to do what I can and to use any knowledge I have in his behalf I arrived in England full of exultation at the thought that I had fulfilled the mission with which he had trusted me I had got what he said were the last objects of his search and I felt assured that he would now be able to begin the experiment of which he had often hinted to me It is too dreadful that at just such a time such a calamity should have fallen on him Doctor Winchester you are a physician and if your face does not belie you you are a clever and a bold one Is there no way which you can devise to wake this man from his unnatural stupor There was a pause then the answer came slowly and deliberately There is no ordinary remedy that I know of There might possibly be some extraordinary one But there would be no use in trying to find it except on one condition And that Knowledge I am completely ignorant of Egyptian matters language writing history secrets medicines poisons occult powers all that go to make up the mystery of that mysterious land This disease or condition or whatever it may be called from which Mr Trelawny is suffering is in some way connected with Egypt I have had a suspicion of this from the first and later it grew into a certainty though without proof What you have said tonight confirms my conjecture and makes me believe that a proof is to be had I do not think that you quite know all that has gone on in this house since the night of the attack of the finding of Mr Trelawny s body Now I propose that we confide in you If Mr Ross agrees I shall ask him to tell you He is more skilled than I am in putting facts before other people He can speak by his brief and in this case he has the best of all briefs the experience of his own eyes and ears and the evidence that he has himself taken on the spot from participators in or spectators of what has happened When you know all you will I hope be in a position to judge as to whether you can best help Mr Trelawny and further his secret wishes by your silence or your speech I nodded approval Mr Corbeck jumped up and in his impulsive way held out a hand to each Done he said I acknowledge the honour of your confidence and on my part I pledge myself that if I find my duty to Mr Trelawny s wishes will in his own interest allow my lips to open on his affairs I shall speak so freely as I may Accordingly I began and told him as exactly as I could everything that had happened from the moment of my waking at the knocking on the door in Jermyn Street The only reservations I made were as to my own feeling toward Miss Trelawny and the matters of small import to the main subject which followed it and my conversations with Sergeant Daw which were in themselves private and which would have demanded discretionary silence in any case As I spoke Mr Corbeck followed with breathless interest Sometimes he would stand up and pace about the room in uncontrollable excitement and then recover himself suddenly and sit down again Sometimes he would be about to speak but would with an effort restrain himself I think the narration helped me to make up my own mind for even as I talked things seemed to appear in a clearer light Things big and little in relation of their importance to the case fell into proper perspective The story up to date became coherent except as to its cause which seemed a greater mystery than ever This is the merit of entire or collected narrative Isolated facts doubts suspicions conjectures give way to a homogeneity which is convincing That Mr Corbeck was convinced was evident He did not go through any process of explanation or limitation but spoke right out at once to the point and fearlessly like a man That settles me There is in activity some Force that needs special care If we all go on working in the dark we shall get in one another s way and by hampering each other undo the good that any or each of us working in different directions might do It seems to me that the first thing we have to accomplish is to get Mr Trelawny waked out of that unnatural sleep That he can be waked is apparent from the way the Nurse has recovered though what additional harm may have been done to him in the time he has been lying in that room I suppose no one can tell We must chance that however He has lain there and whatever the effect might be it is there now and we have and shall have to deal with it as a fact A day more or less won t hurt in the long run It is late now and we shall probably have tomorrow a task before us that will require our energies afresh You Doctor will want to get to your sleep for I suppose you have other work as well as this to do tomorrow As for you Mr Ross I understand that you are to have a spell of watching in the sick room tonight I shall get you a book which will help to pass the time for you I shall go and,bramStoker
