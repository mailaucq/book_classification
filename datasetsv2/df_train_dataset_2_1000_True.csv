I saw through the open door way a lonely girl sewing at a lonely window A pale cheeked girl and fly specked window with wasps about the mended upper panes I spoke She shyly started like some Tahiti girl secreted for a sacrifice first catching sight through palms of Captain Cook Recovering she bade me enter with her apron brushed off a stool then silently resumed her own With thanks I took the stool but now for a space I too was mute This then is the fairy mountain house and here the fairy queen sitting at her fairy window I went up to it Downwards directed by the tunneled pass as through a leveled telescope I caught sight of a far off soft azure world I hardly knew it though I came from it You must find this view very pleasant said I at last Oh sir tears starting in her eyes the first time I looked out of this window I said never never shall I weary of this And what wearies you of it now I don t know while a tear fell but it is not the view it is Marianna Some months back her brother only seventeen had come hither a long way from the other side to cut wood and burn coal and she elder sister had accompanied him Long had they been orphans and now sole inhabitants of the sole house upon the mountain No guest came no traveler passed The zigzag perilous road was only used at seasons by the coal wagons The brother was absent the entire day sometimes the entire night When at evening fagged out he did come home he soon left his bench poor fellow for his bed just as one at last wearily quits that too for still deeper rest The bench the bed the grave Silent I stood by the fairy window while these things were being told Do you know said she at last as stealing from her story do you know who lives yonder I have never been down into that country away off there I mean that house that marble one pointing far across the lower landscape have you not caught it there on the long hill side the field before the woods behind the white shines out against their blue don t you mark it the only house in sight I looked and after a time to my surprise recognized more by its position than its aspect or Marianna s description my own abode glimmering much like this mountain one from the piazza The mirage haze made it appear less a farm house than King Charming s palace I have often wondered who lives there but it must be some happy one again this morning was I thinking so Some happy one returned I starting and why do you think that You judge some rich one lives there Rich or not I never thought but it looks so happy I can t tell how and it is so far away Sometimes I think I do but dream it is there You should see it in a sunset No doubt the sunset gilds it finely but not more than the sunrise does this house perhaps This house The sun is a good sun but it never gilds this house Why should it This old house is rotting That makes it so mossy In the morning the sun comes in at this old window to be sure boarded up when first we came a window I can t keep clean do what I may and half burns and nearly blinds me at my sewing besides setting the flies and wasps astir such flies and wasps as only lone mountain houses know See here is the curtain this apron I try to shut it out with then It fades it you see Sun gild this house not that ever Marianna saw Because when this roof is gilded most then you stay here within The hottest weariest hour of day you mean Sir the sun gilds not this roof It leaked so brother newly shingled all one side Did you not see it The north side where the sun strikes most on what the rain has wetted The sun is a good sun but this roof in first scorches and then rots An old house They went West and are long dead they say who built it A mountain house In winter no fox could den in it That chimney place has been blocked up with snow just like a hollow stump Yours are strange fancies Marianna They but reflect the things Then I should have said These are strange things rather than Yours are strange fancies As you will and took up her sewing Something in those quiet words or in that quiet act it made me mute again while noting through the fairy window a broad shadow stealing on as cast by some gigantic condor floating at brooding poise on outstretched wings I marked how by its deeper and inclusive dusk it wiped away into itself all lesser shades of rock or fern You watch the cloud said Marianna No a shadow a cloud s no doubt though that I can not see How did you know it Your eyes are on your work It dusked my work There now the cloud is gone Tray comes back How The dog the shaggy dog At noon he steals off of himself to change his shape returns and lies down awhile nigh the door Don t you see him His head is turned round at you though when you came he looked before him Your eyes rest but on your work what do you speak of By the window crossing You mean this shaggy shadow the nigh one And yes now that I mark it it is not unlike a large black Newfoundland dog The invading shadow gone the invaded one returns But I do not,hermanMelville
It is my father s fatal science No no Giovanni it was not I Never never I dreamed only to love thee and be with thee a little time and so to let thee pass away leaving but thine image in mine heart for Giovanni believe it though my body be nourished with poison my spirit is God s creature and craves love as its daily food But my father he has united us in this fearful sympathy Yes spurn me tread upon me kill me Oh what is death after such words as thine But it was not I Not for a world of bliss would I have done it Giovanni s passion had exhausted itself in its outburst from his lips There now came across him a sense mournful and not without tenderness of the intimate and peculiar relationship between Beatrice and himself They stood as it were in an utter solitude which would be made none the less solitary by the densest throng of human life Ought not then the desert of humanity around them to press this insulated pair closer together If they should be cruel to one another who was there to be kind to them Besides thought Giovanni might there not still be a hope of his returning within the limits of ordinary nature and leading Beatrice the redeemed Beatrice by the hand O weak and selfish and unworthy spirit that could dream of an earthly union and earthly happiness as possible after such deep love had been so bitterly wronged as was Beatrice s love by Giovanni s blighting words No no there could be no such hope She must pass heavily with that broken heart across the borders of Time she must bathe her hurts in some fount of paradise and forget her grief in the light of immortality and THERE be well But Giovanni did not know it Dear Beatrice said he approaching her while she shrank away as always at his approach but now with a different impulse dearest Beatrice our fate is not yet so desperate Behold there is a medicine potent as a wise physician has assured me and almost divine in its efficacy It is composed of ingredients the most opposite to those by which thy awful father has brought this calamity upon thee and me It is distilled of blessed herbs Shall we not quaff it together and thus be purified from evil Give it me said Beatrice extending her hand to receive the little silver vial which Giovanni took from his bosom She added with a peculiar emphasis I will drink but do thou await the result She put Baglioni s antidote to her lips and at the same moment the figure of Rappaccini emerged from the portal and came slowly towards the marble fountain As he drew near the pale man of science seemed to gaze with a triumphant expression at the beautiful youth and maiden as might an artist who should spend his life in achieving a picture or a group of statuary and finally be satisfied with his success He paused his bent form grew erect with conscious power he spread out his hands over them in the attitude of a father imploring a blessing upon his children but those were the same hands that had thrown poison into the stream of their lives Giovanni trembled Beatrice shuddered nervously and pressed her hand upon her heart My daughter said Rappaccini thou art no longer lonely in the world Pluck one of those precious gems from thy sister shrub and bid thy bridegroom wear it in his bosom It will not harm him now My science and the sympathy between thee and him have so wrought within his system that he now stands apart from common men as thou dost daughter of my pride and triumph from ordinary women Pass on then through the world most dear to one another and dreadful to all besides My father said Beatrice feebly and still as she spoke she kept her hand upon her heart wherefore didst thou inflict this miserable doom upon thy child Miserable exclaimed Rappaccini What mean you foolish girl Dost thou deem it misery to be endowed with marvellous gifts against which no power nor strength could avail an enemy misery to be able to quell the mightiest with a breath misery to be as terrible as thou art beautiful Wouldst thou then have preferred the condition of a weak woman exposed to all evil and capable of none I would fain have been loved not feared murmured Beatrice sinking down upon the ground But now it matters not I am going father where the evil which thou hast striven to mingle with my being will pass away like a dream like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers which will no longer taint my breath among the flowers of Eden Farewell Giovanni Thy words of hatred are like lead within my heart but they too will fall away as I ascend Oh was there not from the first more poison in thy nature than in mine To Beatrice so radically had her earthly part been wrought upon by Rappaccini s skill as poison had been life so the powerful antidote was death and thus the poor victim of man s ingenuity and of thwarted nature and of the fatality that attends all such efforts of perverted wisdom perished there at the feet of her father and Giovanni Just at that moment Professor Pietro Baglioni looked forth from the window and called loudly in a tone of triumph mixed with horror to the thunderstricken man of science Rappaccini Rappaccini and is THIS the upshot of your experiment MRS BULLFROG It makes me melancholy to see how like fools some very sensible people act in the matter of choosing wives They perplex their judgments by a most undue attention to little niceties of personal appearance habits disposition and other trifles which concern nobody but,nathanielHawthorne
left on the earth to show that it was all something more than a horrible nightmare So under cloud and sun when the wind blew soft and when it raved over the shrinking land when the cold rain drove men into their yellow slickers and set horses to humping backs and turning tail to the drive of it and one heard the cook muttering profanity because the wood was wet and the water ran down the stovepipe and hungry men must wait because the stove would not draw the Double Crank raked the range Horses grew lean and ill fitting saddles worked their wicked will upon backs that shrank to their touch of a morning Wild range cattle were herded a scared bunch of restlessness during long hot forenoons or longer hotter afternoons while calves that had known no misfortune beyond a wet back or a searching wind learned panic stricken the agony of capture and rough handling and tight drawn ropes and last and worst the terrible searing iron There were not so many of them these reluctant wild eyed pupils in the school of life Charming Billy sitting his horse and keeping tally of the victims in his shabby little book began to know the sinking of spirit that comes to a man when he finds that things have after all gone less smoothly than he had imagined There were withered carcasses scattered through the coul e bottoms and upon side hills that had some time made slippery climbing for a poor weak cow The loss was not crippling but it was greater than he had expected He remembered certain biting storms which had hidden deep the grasses and certain short lived chinooks that had served only to soften the surface of the snow so that the cold coming after might freeze it the harder It had not been a hard winter as winters go but the loss of cows had been above the average and the crop of calves below and Billy for the first time faced squarely the fact that in the cattle business as well as in others there are downs to match the ups In his castle building and so far in his realization of his dreams he had not taken much account of the downs Thus it was that when they swung back from the reservation and camped for a day upon lower Burnt Willow he felt a great yearning for the ranch and for sight of the girl who lived there For excuses he had the mail and the natural wish to consult with Dill so that when he saddled Barney and told Jim Bleeker to keep things moving till to morrow or the day after he had the comfortable inner assurance that there were no side glances or smiles and no lowered lids when he rode away For Charming Billy while he would have faced the ridicule of a nation if that were the price he must pay to win his deep desire was yet well pleased to go on his way unwatched and unneeded Since the Double Crank ranch lay with Burnt Willow Creek loitering through the willows within easy gunshot of the corrals Billy s trail followed the creek except in its most irresponsible windings when he would simplify his journey by taking straight as might be across the prairie It was after he had done this for the second time and had come down to the creek through a narrow yellow clay coulee that he came out quite suddenly upon a thing he had not before seen Across the creek which at that point was so narrow that a horse could all but clear it in a running jump lay the hills a far reaching ocean of fertile green Good grazing it was as Billy well knew In another day the Double Crank riders would be sweeping over it gathering the cattle at least that had been his intent He looked across and his eyes settled immediately upon a long dotted line drawn straight away to the south at the far end a tiny huddle of figures moved indeterminately the details of their business blunted by the distance But Charming Billy though he liked them little knew well when he looked upon a fence in the building The dotted line he read for post holes and the distant figures for the diggers While his horse drank he eyed the line distrustfully until he remembered his parting advice to Dill Dilly s sure getting a move on him he decided estimating roughly the size of the tract which that fence when completed would inclose To be sure it was pure guesswork for he was merely looking at one corner Up the creek he could not see save a quarter mile or so to the next bend even that distance he could not see the dotted line for he was looking upon a level clothed with rank weeds and grass and small brush but he knew it must be there When he turned his horse from the water and went his way his mind was no longer given up to idle dreaming of love words and a girl This fencing business concerned him intimately and his brain was as alert as his eyes For he had not meant that Dilly should fence any land just yet Farther up the creek he crossed meaning to take another short cut and so avoid a long detour also he wanted to see just where and how far the fence went Yes the post holes were there only here they held posts leaning loosely this way and that like drunken men A half mile farther the wire was already strung but not a man did he see whom he might question and when he glanced and saw that the sun was almost straight over his head and that Barney s shadow scurried along nearly beneath his stirrup he knew that they would be stopping,bmBower
blowing through the cracks of the floor It was cold very cold but he first found it out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood died away Ah then it froze him and he crept down again into his warm corner there it was comfortable and cosy When Christmas came and with it the jam with the large lump of butter ah then the grocer was first with him But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke hearing a great noise and knocking against the shutters people hammering from outside The watchman was blowing his horn a great fire had broken out the whole town was in flames Was it in the house or was it at a neighbour s Where was it The alarm increased The grocer s wife was so terrified that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order to save something The grocer seized his account books and the maid her black silk dress Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession so did the Goblin and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the student s room He was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was burning in the neighbour s house just opposite The Goblin seized the book lying on the table put it in his red cap and clasped it with both hands The best treasure in the house was saved and he climbed out on to the roof with it on to the chimney There he sat lighted up by the flames from the burning house opposite both hands holding tightly on his red cap in which lay the treasure and now he knew what his heart really valued most to whom he really belonged But when the fire was put out and the Goblin thought it over then I will divide myself between the two he said I can not quite give up the grocer because of the jam And it is just the same with us We also can not quite give up the grocer because of the jam The House in the Wood From the German of Grimm A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest One morning as he was going to his work he said to his wife Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood and so that she shall not lose her way I will take a bag of millet with me and sprinkle the seed on the path When the sun had risen high over the forest the girl set out with a basin of soup But the field and wood sparrows the larks and finches blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago and the girl could not find her way She went on and on till the sun set and night came on The trees rustled in the darkness the owls hooted and she began to be very much frightened Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees There must be people living yonder she thought who will take me in for the night and she began walking towards it Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows She knocked at the door and a gruff voice called Come in The girl stepped into the dark entrance and tapped at the door of the room Just walk in cried the voice and when she opened the door there sat an old gray haired man at the table His face was resting on his hands and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground By the stove lay three beasts a hen a cock and a brindled cow The girl told the old man her story and asked for a night s lodging The man said Pretty cock Pretty hen And you pretty brindled cow What do you say now Duks answered the beasts and that must have meant We are quite willing for the old man went on Here is abundance go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen and cooked a good meal but she did not think of the beasts She placed the full dishes on the table sat down opposite the gray haired man and ate till her hunger was appeased When she was satisfied she said But now I am so tired where is a bed in which I can sleep The beasts answered You have eaten with him You have drunk with him Of us you have not thought Sleep then as you ought Then the old man said Go upstairs and there you will find a bedroom shake the bed and put clean sheets on and go to sleep The maiden went upstairs and when she had made the bed she lay down After some time the gray haired man came looked at her by the light of his candle and shook his head And when he saw that she was sound asleep he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar The woodcutter came home late in the evening and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food No I did not she answered the girl went off with your dinner She must have lost her way but will no doubt come back to morrow But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food I will take a bag of lentils said he they are larger than millet and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way At midday the maiden took the food but the lentils had all gone as on,andrewLang
alive from fathoms Mr Couthouy Remarks on Coral Formations page states that he has dredged up on the Bahama banks considerable masses of Meandrina from fathoms and he has seen this coral growing in fathoms A Caryophyllia half an inch in diameter was dredged up alive from fathoms off Juan Fernandez latitude deg S by Captain P P King I am indebted to Mr Stokes for having kindly communicated this fact to me together with much other valuable information this is the most remarkable fact with which I am acquainted showing the depth at which a genus of corals often found on reefs can exist We ought however to feel less surprise at this fact as Caryophyllia alone of the lamelliform genera ranges far beyond the tropics it is found in Zetland Fleming s British Animals genus Caryophyllia in Latitude deg N in deep water and I procured a small species from Tierra del Fuego in Latitude deg S Captain Beechey informs me that branches of pink and yellow coral were frequently brought up from between twenty and twenty five fathoms off the Low atolls and Lieutenant Stokes writing to me from the N W coast of Australia says that a strongly branched coral was procured there from thirty fathoms unfortunately it is not known to what genera these corals belong I will record in the form of a note all the facts that I have been able to collect on the depths both within and without the tropics at which those corals and corallines can live which there is no reason to suppose ever materially aid in the construction of a reef In the following list the name of the Zoophyte is followed by the depth in fathoms the country and degrees S latitude and the authority Where no authority is given the observation is Darwin s own SERTULARIA Cape Horn CELLARIA Cape Horn CELLARIA A minute scarlet encrusting

Ombellularia was procured in latitude deg N STICKING to a LINE from the depth of fathoms hence this coral either must have been floating loose or was entangled in stray line at the bottom Off Keeling atoll a compound Ascidia Sigillina was brought up from fathoms and a piece of sponge apparently living from and a fragment of Nullipora also apparently living from fathoms At a greater depth than fathoms off this coral island the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of Halimeda and small fragments of other Nulliporae but all dead Captain B Allen R N informs me that in the survey of the West Indies it was noticed that between the depth of and fathoms the sounding lead very generally came up coated with the dead joints of a Halimeda of which he showed me specimens Off Pernambuco in Brazil in about twelve fathoms the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a dull red Nullipora and I infer from Roussin s chart that a bottom of this kind extends over a wide area On the beach within the coral reefs of Mauritius vast quantities of fragments of Nulliporae were piled up From these facts it appears that these simply organized bodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea Although the limit of depth at which each particular kind of coral ceases to exist is far from being accurately known yet when we bear in mind the manner in which the clumps of coral gradually became infrequent at about the same depth and wholly disappeared at a greater depth than twenty fathoms on the slope round Keeling atoll on the leeward side of the Mauritius and at rather less depth both without and within the atolls of the Maldiva and Chagos Archipelagoes and when we know that the reefs round these islands do not differ from other coral formations in their form and structure we may I think conclude that in ordinary cases reef building polypifers do not flourish at greater depths than between twenty and thirty fathoms It has been argued Journal of the Royal Geographical Society page that reefs may possibly rise from very great depths through the means of small corals first making a platform for the growth of the stronger kinds This however is an arbitrary supposition it is not always remembered that in such cases there is an antagonist power in action namely the decay of organic bodies when not protected by a covering of sediment or by their own rapid growth We have moreover no right to calculate on unlimited time for the accumulation of small organic bodies into great masses Every fact in geology proclaims that neither the land nor the bed of the sea retain for indefinite periods the same level As well might it be imagined that the British Seas would in time become choked up with beds of oysters or that the numerous small corallines off the inhospitable shores of Tierra del Fuego would in time form a solid and extensive coral,charlesDarwin
from adequate to create Yes that s Lord Luxellian s he said yet again after a while as he still looked in the same direction What be we going there No Endelstow Vicarage as I have told you I thought you m t have altered your mind sir as ye have stared that way at nothing so long Oh no I am interested in the house that s all Most people be as the saying is Not in the sense that I am Oh Well his family is no better than my own a b lieve How is that Hedgers and ditchers by rights But once in ancient times one of em when he was at work changed clothes with King Charles the Second and saved the king s life King Charles came up to him like a common man and said off hand Man in the smock frock my name is Charles the Second and that s the truth on t Will you lend me your clothes I don t mind if I do said Hedger Luxellian and they changed there and then Now mind ye King Charles the Second said like a common man as he rode away if ever I come to the crown you come to court knock at the door and say out bold Is King Charles the Second at home Tell your name and they shall let you in and you shall be made a lord Now that was very nice of Master Charley Very nice indeed Well as the story is the king came to the throne and some years after that away went Hedger Luxellian knocked at the king s door and asked if King Charles the Second was in No he isn t they said Then is Charles the Third said Hedger Luxellian Yes said a young feller standing by like a common man only he had a crown on my name is Charles the Third And I really fancy that must be a mistake I don t recollect anything in English history about Charles the Third said the other in a tone of mild remonstrance Oh that s right history enough only twasn t prented he was rather a queer tempered man if you remember Very well go on And by hook or by crook Hedger Luxellian was made a lord and everything went on well till some time after when he got into a most terrible row with King Charles the Fourth I can t stand Charles the Fourth Upon my word that s too much Why There was a George the Fourth wasn t there Certainly Well Charleses be as common as Georges However I ll say no more about it Ah well tis the funniest world ever I lived in upon my life tis Ah that such should be The dusk had thickened into darkness while they thus conversed and the outline and surface of the mansion gradually disappeared The windows which had before been as black blots on a lighter expanse of wall became illuminated and were transfigured to squares of light on the general dark body of the night landscape as it absorbed the outlines of the edifice into its gloomy monochrome Not another word was spoken for some time and they climbed a hill then another hill piled on the summit of the first An additional mile of plateau followed from which could be discerned two light houses on the coast they were nearing reposing on the horizon with a calm lustre of benignity Another oasis was reached a little dell lay like a nest at their feet towards which the driver pulled the horse at a sharp angle and descended a steep slope which dived under the trees like a rabbit s burrow They sank lower and lower Endelstow Vicarage is

backward and forward Ah well tis a funny world A b lieve there was once a quarry where this house stands The man who built it in past time scraped all the glebe for earth to put round the vicarage and laid out a little paradise of flowers and trees in the soil he had got together in this way whilst the fields he scraped have been good for nothing ever since How long has the present incumbent been

of feeling herself his would inexpressibly comfort her mind I am sure Then if she is taken from us I should not have lost the power of becoming his lawful wife at some future day if it indeed should be deemed expedient if on the other hand she lives he can on her recovery inform her of the incompleteness of their marriage contract the ceremony can be repeated and I can and I am sure willingly would avoid troubling them with my presence till grey hairs and wrinkles make his unfortunate passion for me a thing of the past I put all this before him but he demurred Sept I have urged him again He says he will consider It is no time to mince matters and as a further inducement I have offered to enter into a solemn engagement to marry him myself a year after her death Sept Later An agitating interview He says he will agree to whatever I propose the three possibilities and our contingent acts being recorded as follows First in the event of dear Caroline being taken from us I marry him on the expiration of a year Second in the forlorn chance of her recovery I take upon myself the responsibility of explaining to Caroline the true nature of the ceremony he has gone through with her that it was done at my suggestion to make her happy at once before a special licence could be obtained and that a public ceremony at church is awaiting her Third in the unlikely event of her cooling and refusing to repeat the ceremony with him I leave England join him abroad and there wed him agreeing not to live in England again till Caroline has either married another or regards her attachment to Charles as a bygone matter I have thought over these conditions and have agreed to them all as they stand p m I do not much like this scheme after all For one thing I have just sounded my father on it before parting with him for the night my impression having been that he would see no objection But he says he could on no account countenance any such unreal proceeding however good our intentions and even though the poor girl were dying it would not be right So I sadly seek my pillow October I am sure my father is wrong in his view Why is it not right if it would be balm to Caroline s wounded soul and if a real ceremony is absolutely refused by Charles moreover is hardly practicable in the difficulty of getting a special licence if he were agreed My father does not know or will not believe that Caroline s attachment has been the cause of her hopeless condition But that it is so and that the form of words would give her inexpressible happiness I know well for I whispered tentatively in her ear on such marriages and the effect was great Henceforth my father can not be taken into confidence on the subject of Caroline He does not understand her o clock noon I have taken advantage of my father s absence to day to confide my secret notion to a thoughtful young man who called here this morning to speak to my father He is the Mr Theophilus Higham of whom I have already had occasion to speak a Scripture reader in the next town and is soon going to be ordained I told him the pitiable case and my remedy He says ardently that he will assist me would do anything for me he is in truth an admirer of mine he sees no wrong in such an act of charity He is coming again to the house this afternoon before my father returns to carry out the idea I have spoken to Charles who promises to be ready I must now break the news to Caroline o clock p m I have been in too much excitement till now to set down the result We have accomplished our plan and though I feel like a guilty sinner I am glad My father of course is not to be informed as yet Caroline has had a seraphic expression upon her wasted transparent face ever since I should hardly be surprised if it really saved her life even now and rendered a legitimate union necessary between them In that case my father can be informed of the whole proceeding and in the face of such wonderful success can not disapprove Meanwhile poor Charles has not lost the possibility of taking unworthy me to fill her place should she But I can not contemplate that alternative unmoved and will not write it Charles left for the South of Europe immediately after the ceremony He was in a high strung throbbing almost wild state of mind at first but grew calmer under my exhortations I had to pay the penalty of receiving a farewell kiss from him which I much regret considering its meaning but he took me so unexpectedly and in a moment was gone Oct She certainly is better and even when she found that Charles had been suddenly obliged to leave she received the news quite cheerfully The doctor says that her apparent improvement may be delusive but I think our impressing upon her the necessity of keeping what has occurred a secret from papa and everybody helps to give her a zest for life Oct She is still mending I am glad to have saved her my only sister if I have done so though I shall now never become Charles s wife CHAPTER VII A SURPRISE AWAITS HER Feb Writing has been absolutely impossible for a long while but I now reach a stage at which it seems possible to jot down a line Caroline s recovery extending over four months has

had wandered and what chances we had been taking He traced our wheel tracks to the imminent verge of danger in two places I have always been glad that we were not killed that night I do not know any particular reason but I have always been glad In the morning the tenth day out we crossed Green River a fine large limpid streamstuck in it with the water just up to the top of our mail bed and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep bank But it was nice cool water and besides it could not find any fresh place on us to wet At the Green River station we had breakfasthot biscuits fresh antelope steaks and coffeethe only decent meal we tasted between the United States and Great Salt Lake City and the only one we were ever really thankful for Think of the monotonous

Camp Floyd The day before they had fired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians whom they supposed gathered together for no good purpose In the fight that had ensued four Indians were captured and the main body chased four miles but nobody killed This looked like business We had a notion to get out and join the sixty soldiers but upon reflecting that there were four hundred of the Indians we concluded to go on and join the Indians Echo Canyon is twenty miles long It was like a long smooth narrow street with a gradual descending grade and shut in by enormous perpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate four hundred feet high in many places and turreted like mediaeval castles This was the most faultless piece of road in the mountains and the driver said he would let his team out He did and if the Pacific express trains whiz through there now any faster than we did then in the stage coach I envy the passengers the exhilaration of it We fairly seemed to pick up our wheels and flyand the mail matter was lifted up free from everything and held in solution I am not given to exaggeration and when I say a thing I mean it However time presses At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit of Big Mountain fifteen miles from Salt Lake City when all the world was glorified with the setting sun and the most stupendous panorama of mountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight We looked out upon this sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow Even the overland stage driver stopped his horses and gazed Half an hour or an hour later we changed horses and took supper with a Mormon Destroying Angel Destroying Angels as I understand it are Latter Day Saints who are set apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious citizens I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and the dark and bloody deeds they had done and when I entered this ones house I had my shudder all ready But alas for all our romances he was nothing but a loud profane offensive old blackguard He was murderous enough possibly to fill the bill of a Destroyer but would you have any kind of an Angel devoid of dignity Could you abide an Angel in an unclean shirt and no suspenders Could you respect an Angel with a horse laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer jpg K There were other blackguards presentcomrades of this one And there was one person that looked like a gentlemanHeber C Kimballs son tall and well made and thirty years old perhaps A lot of slatternly women flitted hither and thither in a hurry with coffee pots plates of bread and other appurtenances to supper and these were said to be the wives of the Angelor some of them at least And of course they were for if they had been hired help they would not have let an angel from above storm and swear at them as he did let alone one from the place this one hailed from This was our first experience of the western peculiar institution and it was not very prepossessing We did not tarry long to observe it but hurried on to the home of the Latter Day Saints the stronghold of the prophets the capital of the only absolute monarch in AmericaGreat Salt Lake City As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake House and unpacked our baggage CHAPTER XIII We had a fine supper of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetablesa great,markTwain
house but they say it is a sweet pretty place As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life said Mr Palmer Marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said Is it very ugly continued Mrs Palmer then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose When they were seated in the dining room Sir John observed with regret that they were only eight all together My dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should be so few Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today Did not I tell you Sir John when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done They dined with us last You and I Sir John said Mrs Jennings should not stand upon such ceremony Then you would be very ill bred cried Mr Palmer My love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual laugh Do you know that you are quite rude I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill bred Ay you may abuse me as you please said the good natured old lady you have taken Charlotte off my hands and can not give her back again So there I have the whip hand of you Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to her as they must live together It was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good natured or more determined to be happy than Mrs Palmer The studied indifference insolence and discontent of her husband gave her no pain and when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted Mr Palmer is so droll said she in a whisper to Elinor He is always out of humour Elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding like many others of his sex that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly woman but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it It was rather a wish of distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body and his general abuse of every thing before him It was the desire of appearing superior to other people The motive was too common to be wondered at but the means however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill breeding were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife Oh my dear Miss Dashwood said Mrs Palmer soon afterwards I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas Now pray do and come while the Westons are with us You can not think how happy I shall be It will be quite delightful My love applying to her husband don t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland Certainly he replied with a sneer I came into Devonshire with no other view There now said his lady you see Mr Palmer expects you so you can not refuse to come They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation But indeed you must and shall come I am sure you will like it of all things The Westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is and we are so gay now for Mr Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before it is quite charming But poor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced to make every body like him Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation How charming it will be said Charlotte when he is in Parliament won t it How I shall laugh It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M P But do you know he says he will never frank for me He declares he won t Don t you Mr Palmer Mr Palmer took no notice of her He can not bear writing you know she continued he says it is quite shocking No said he I never said any thing so irrational Don t palm all your abuses of language upon me There now you see how droll he is This is always the way with him Sometimes he won t speak to me for half a day together and then he comes out with something so droll all about any thing in the world She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing room by asking her whether she did not like Mr Palmer excessively Certainly said Elinor he seems very agreeable Well I am so glad you do I thought you would he is so pleasant and Mr Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you and you can t think how disappointed he will be if you don t come to Cleveland I can t imagine why you should object to it Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county Mrs Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby s general character than could be gathered from the Middletons partial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain,janeAusten
philosophy on the form of sexual intercourse and inculcated the doctrine of Platonic love an exquisitely refined intercourse but much better adapted to the ideal inhabitants of his imaginary island of Atlantis than to the sturdy race composed of rebellious flesh and blood which populates the little matter of fact island we inhabit Besides these systems we have moreover the poetical theogony of old Hesiod who generated the whole universe in the regular mode of procreation and the plausible opinion of others that the earth was hatched from the great egg of night which floated in chaos and was cracked by the horns of the celestial bull To illustrate this last doctrine Burnet in his theory of the earth has favored us with an accurate drawing and description both of the form and texture of this mundane egg which is found to bear a marvelous resemblance to that of a goose Such of my readers as take a proper interest in the origin of this our planet will be pleased to learn that the most profound sages of antiquity among the Egyptians Chaldeans Persians Greeks and Latins have alternately assisted at the hatching of this strange bird and that their cacklings have been caught and continued in different tones and inflections from philosopher to philosopher unto the present day But while briefly noticing long celebrated systems of ancient sages let me not pass over with neglect those of other philosophers which though less universal than renowned have equal claims to attention and equal chance for correctness Thus it is recorded by the Brahmins in the pages of their inspired Shastah that the angel Bistnoo transformed himself into a great boar plunged into the watery abyss and brought up the earth on his tusks Then issued from him a mighty tortoise and a mighty snake and Bistnoo placed the snake erect upon the back of the tortoise and he placed the earth upon the head of the snake The negro philosophers of Congo affirm that the world was made by the hands of angels excepting their own country which the Supreme Being constructed himself that it might be supremely excellent And he took great pains with the inhabitants and made them very black and beautiful and when he had finished the first man he was well pleased with him and smoothed him over the face and hence his nose and the nose of all his descendants became flat The Mohawk philosophers tell us that a pregnant woman fell down from heaven and that a tortoise took her upon its back because every place was covered with water and that the woman sitting upon the tortoise paddled with her hands in the water and raked up the earth whence it finally happened that the earth became higher than the water But I forbear to quote a number more of these ancient and outlandish philosophers whose deplorable ignorance in despite of all their erudition compelled them to write in languages which but few of my readers can understand and I shall proceed briefly to notice a few more intelligible and fashionable theories of their modern successors And first I shall mention the great Buffon who conjectures that this globe was originally a globe of liquid fire scintillated from the body of the sun by the percussion of a comet as a spark is generated by the collision of flint and steel That at first it was surrounded by gross vapors which cooling and condensing in process of time constituted according to their densities earth water and air which gradually arranged themselves according to their respective gravities round the burning or vitrified mass that formed their center Hutton on the contrary supposes that the waters at first were universally paramount and he terrifies himself with the idea that the earth must be eventually washed away by the force of rain rivers and mountain torrents until it is confounded with the ocean or in other words absolutely dissolves into itself Sublime idea far surpassing that of the tender hearted damsel of antiquity who wept herself into a fountain or the good dame of Narbonne in France who for a volubility of tongue unusual in her sex was doomed to peel five hundred thousand and thirty nine ropes of onions and actually run out at her eyes before half the hideous task was accomplished Whistorn the same ingenious philosopher who rivaled Ditton in his researches after the longitude for which the mischief loving Swift discharged on their heads a most savory stanza has distinguished himself by a very admirable theory respecting the earth He conjectures that it was originally a chaotic comet which being selected for the abode of man was removed from its eccentric orbit and whirled round the sun in its present regular motion by which change of direction order succeeded to confusion in the arrangement of its component parts The philosopher adds that the deluge was produced by an uncourteous salute from the watery tail of another comet doubtless through sheer envy of its improved condition thus furnishing a melancholy proof that jealousy may prevail even among the heavenly bodies and discord interrupt that celestial harmony of the spheres so melodiously sung by the poets But I pass over a variety of excellent theories among which are those of Burnet and Woodward and Whitehurst regretting extremely that my time will not suffer me to give them the notice they deserve and shall conclude with that of the renowned Dr Darwin This learned Theban who is as much distinguished for rhyme as reason and for good natured credulity as serious research and who has recommended himself wonderfully to the good graces of the ladies by letting them into all the gallantries amours debaucheries and other topics of scandal of the court of Flora has fallen upon a theory worthy of his combustible imagination According to his opinion the huge mass of chaos took a sudden occasion to explode like a barrel of gunpowder and,whashingtonIrving
It was not the thought of missing the service that worried him What really was serious was that he had been late so many times before that Merevale had hinted at serious steps to be taken if he were late again or at any rate until a considerable interval of punctuality had elapsed That threat had been uttered only yesterday and here he was in all probability late once more There was no time to dress He sprang out of bed passed a sponge over his face as a concession to the decencies and looked round for something to cover his night shirt which however suitable for dormitory use was he felt instinctively scarcely the garment to wear in public Fate seemed to fight for him On one of the pegs in the wall hung a mackintosh a large blessed mackintosh He was inside it in a moment Four minutes later he rushed into his place in chapel The short service gave him some time for recovering himself He left the building feeling a new man His costume though quaint would not call for comment Chapel at St Austin s was never a full dress ceremony Mackintoshes covering night shirts were the rule rather than the exception But between his costume and that of the rest there was this subtle distinction They wore their own mackintoshes He wore somebody else s The bulk of the School had split up into sections each section making for its own House and Merevale s was already in sight when Harrison felt himself grasped from behind He turned to see Graham Might I ask enquired Tony with great politeness who said you might wear my mackintosh Harrison gasped I suppose you didn t know it was mine No no rather not I didn t know And if you had known it was mine you wouldn t have taken it I suppose Oh no of course not said Harrison Graham seemed to be taking an unexpectedly sensible view of the situation Well said Tony now that you know that it is mine suppose you give it up Give it up Yes buck up It looks like rain and I mustn t catch cold But Graham I ve only got on Spare us these delicate details Mack up please I want it Finally Harrison appearing to be difficult in the matter Tony took the garment off for him and went on his way Harrison watched him go with mixed feelings Righteous indignation struggled with the gravest apprehension regarding his own future If Merevale should see him Horrible thought He ran He had just reached the House and was congratulating himself on having escaped when the worst happened At the private entrance stood Merevale and with him the Headmaster himself They both eyed him with considerable interest as he shot in at the boys entrance Harrison said Merevale after breakfast Yes sir The Headmaster wishes to see you again Yes sir said Harrison There was a curious lack of enthusiasm in his voice L AFFAIRE UNCLE JOHN A Story in Letters I From Richard Venables of St Austin s School to his brother Archibald Venables of King s College Cambridge Dear Archie I take up my pen to write to you not as one hoping for an answer but rather in order that you notice the Thucydidean construction I may tell you of an event the most important of those that have gone before You may or may not have heard far off echoes of my adventure with Uncle John who has just come back from the diamond mines and looks it It happened thusly Last Wednesday evening I was going through the cricket field to meet Uncle John at the station as per esteemed favour from the governor telling me to Just as I got on the scene to my horror amazement and disgust I saw a middle aged bounder in loud checks who from his looks might have been anything from a retired pawnbroker to a second hand butler sacked from his last place for stealing the sherry standing in the middle of the field on the very wicket the Rugborough match is to be played on next Saturday tomorrow and digging digging I ll trouble you Excavating great chunks of our best turf with a walking stick I was so unnerved I nearly fainted It s bad enough being captain of a School team under any circs as far as putting you off your game goes but when you see the wicket you ve been rolling by day and dreaming about by night being mangled by an utter stranger well They say a cow is slightly irritated when her calf is taken away from her but I don t suppose the most maternal cow that ever lived came anywhere near the frenzy that surged up in my bosom at that moment I flew up to him foaming at the mouth My dear sir I shrieked are you aware that you re spoiling the best wicket that has ever been prepared since cricket began He looked at me in a dazed sort of way and said What I said How on earth do you think we re going to play Rugborough on a ploughed field I don t follow mister he replied A man who calls you mister is beyond the pale You are justified in being a little rude to him So I said Then you must be either drunk or mad and I trust it s the latter I believe that s from some book though I don t remember which This did seem to wake him up a bit but before he could frame his opinion in words up came Biffen the ground man to have a last look at his wicket before retiring for the night When he saw the holes they were about a foot deep and scattered

very early you see I hope you are not going to be ill child You look as if you ought not to be here O it is quite trifling Does not getting up in a hurry cause a sense of faintness sometimes Yes in people who are not strong If we don t talk about being faint it will go off Faintness is such a queer thing that to think of it is to have it Let us talk as we were talking before about your young man and other indifferent matters so as to divert my thoughts from fainting dear Berta I have always thought the book was to be forwarded to that gentleman because he was a connection of yours by marriage and he had asked for it And so you have met this this Mr Julian and gone for walks with him in evenings I suppose just as young men and women do who are courting No indeed what an absurd child you are said Ethelberta I knew him once and he is interesting a few little things like that make it all up The love is all on one side as with me O no no there is nothing like that I am not attached to any one strictly speaking though more strictly speaking I am not unattached Tis a delightful middle mind to be in I know it for I was like it once but I had scarcely been so long enough to know where I was before I was gone past You should have commanded yourself or drawn back entirely for let me tell you that at the beginning of caring for a man just when you are suspended between thinking and feeling there is a hair s breadth of time at which the question of getting into love or not getting in is a matter of will quite a thing of choice At the same time drawing back is a tame dance and the best of all is to stay balanced awhile You do that well I ll warrant Well no for what between continually wanting to love to escape the blank lives of those who do not and wanting not to love to keep out of the miseries of those who do I get foolishly warm and foolishly cold by turns Yes and I am like you as far as the foolishly goes I wish we poor girls could contrive to bring a little wisdom into our love by way of a change That s the very thing that leading minds in town have begun to do but there are difficulties It is easy to love wisely but the rich man may not marry you and it is not very hard to reject wisely but the poor man doesn t care Altogether it is a precious problem But shall we clamber out upon those shining blocks of rock and find some of the little yellow shells that are in the crevices I have ten minutes longer and then I must go THE DINING ROOM OF A TOWN HOUSE THE BUTLER S PANTRY A few weeks later there was a friendly dinner party at the house of a gentleman called Doncastle who lived in a moderately fashionable square of west London All the friends and relatives present were nice people who exhibited becoming signs of pleasure and gaiety at being there but as regards the vigour with which these emotions were expressed it may be stated that a slight laugh from far down the throat and a slight narrowing of the eye were equivalent as indices of the degree of mirth felt to a Ha ha ha and a shaking of the shoulders among the minor traders of the kingdom and to a Ho ho ho contorted features purple face and stamping foot among the gentlemen in corduroy and fustian who adorn the remoter provinces The conversation was chiefly about a volume of musical tender and humorous rhapsodies lately issued to the world in the guise of verse which had been reviewed and talked about everywhere This topic beginning as a private dialogue between a young painter named Ladywell and the lady on his right hand had enlarged its ground by degrees as a subject will extend on those rare occasions when it happens to be one about which each person has thought something beforehand instead of as in the natural order of things one to which the oblivious listener replies mechanically with earnest features but with thoughts far away And so the whole table made the matter a thing to inquire or reply upon at once and isolated rills of other chat died out like a river in the sands Witty things and occasionally Anacreontic and they have the originality which such a style must naturally possess when carried out by a feminine hand said Ladywell If it is a feminine hand said a man near Ladywell looked as if he sometimes knew secrets though he did not wish to boast Written I presume you mean in the Anacreontic measure of three feet and a half spondees and iambics said a gentleman in spectacles glancing round and giving emphasis to his inquiry by causing bland glares of a circular shape to proceed from his glasses towards the person interrogated The company appeared willing to give consideration to the words of a man who knew such things as that and hung forward to listen But Ladywell stopped the whole current of affairs in that direction by saying O no I was speaking rather of the matter and tone In fact the Seven Days Review said they were Anacreontic you know and so they are any one may feel they are The general look then implied a false encouragement and the man in spectacles looked down again being a nervous person who never had time to show his merits because he was so much occupied in hiding his faults Do you know the

the song and then sang themselves so that the repast was a merry one and lasted much longer than usual At length seeing that the sun was about to set Sadia said to the porter Rise and go it is now time for us to separate Oh madam replied he how can you desire me to quit you in the state in which I am Between the wine I have drunk and the pleasure of seeing you I should never find the way to my house Let me remain here till morning and when I have recovered my senses I will go when you like Let him stay said Amina who had before proved herself his friend It is only just as he has given us so much amusement If you wish it my sister replied Zobeida but if he does I must make a new condition Porter she continued turning to him if you remain you must promise to ask no questions about anything you may see If you do you may perhaps hear what you don t like This being settled Amina brought in supper and lit up the hall with a number of sweet smelling tapers They then sat down again at the table and began with fresh appetites to eat drink sing and recite verses In fact they were all enjoying themselves mightily when they heard a knock at the outer door which Sadie rose to open She soon returned saying that three Calenders all blind in the right eye and all with their heads faces and eyebrows clean shaved begged for admittance as they were newly arrived in Bagdad and night had already fallen They seem to have pleasant manners she added but you have no idea how funny they look I am sure we should find their company diverting Zobeida and Amina made some difficulty about admitting the new comers and Sadie knew the reason of their hesitation But she urged the matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last forced to consent Bring them in then said she but make them understand that they are not to make remarks about what does not concern them and be sure to make them read the inscription over the door For on the door was written in letters of gold Whoso meddles in affairs that are no business of his will hear truths that will not please him The three Calenders bowed low on entering and thanked the ladies for their kindness and hospitality The ladies replied with words of welcome and they were all about to seat themselves when the eyes of the Calenders fell on the porter whose dress was not so very unlike their own though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him This said one of them is apparently one of our Arab brothers who has rebelled against our ruler The porter although half asleep from the wine he had drunk heard the words and without moving cried angrily to the Calender Sit down and mind your own business Did you not read the inscription over the door Everybody is not obliged to live in the same way Do not be so angry my good man replied the Calender we should be very sorry to displease you so the quarrel was smoothed over and supper began in good earnest When the Calenders had satisfied their hunger they offered to play to their hostesses if there were any instruments in the house The ladies were delighted at the idea and Sadie went to see what she could find returning in a few moments laden with two different kinds of flutes and a tambourine Each Calender took the one he preferred and began to play a well known air while the ladies sang the words of the song These words were the gayest and liveliest possible and every now and then the singers had to stop to indulge the laughter which almost choked them In the midst of all their noise a knock was heard at the door Now early that evening the Caliph secretly left the palace accompanied by his grand vizir Giafar and Mesrour chief of the eunuchs all three wearing the dresses of merchants Passing down the street the Caliph had been attracted by the music of instruments and the sound of laughter and had ordered his vizir to go and knock at the door of the house as he wished to enter The vizir replied that the ladies who lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends and he thought his master would do well not to intrude on them but the Caliph had taken it into his head to see for himself and insisted on being obeyed The knock was answered by Sadie with a taper in her hand and the vizir who was surprised at her beauty bowed low before her and said respectfully Madam we are three merchants who have lately arrived from Moussoul and owing to a misadventure which befel us this very night only reached our inn to find that the doors were closed to us till to morrow morning Not knowing what to do we wandered in the streets till we happened to pass your house when seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices we resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the dawn If you will grant us this favour we will with your permission do all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly Sadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her sisters and after having talked over the matter with them she returned to tell him that he and his two friends would be welcome to join their company They entered and bowed politely to the ladies and their guests Then Zobeida as the mistress came forward and said gravely You are welcome here but I hope you will allow me to beg one thing of you have as many,andrewLang
advice it must be added for which he had never asked He would have been incapable of asking for it for he had no perception of difficulties and consequently no curiosity about remedies The complex Parisian world about him seemed a very simple affair it was an immense amazing spectacle but it neither inflamed his imagination nor irritated his curiosity He kept his hands in his pockets looked on good humoredly desired to miss nothing important observed a great many things narrowly and never reverted to himself Mrs Tristram s advice was a part of the show and a more entertaining element in her abundant gossip than the others He enjoyed her talking about himself it seemed a part of her beautiful ingenuity but he never made an application of anything she said or remembered it when he was away from her For herself she appropriated him he was the most interesting thing she had had to think about in many a month She wished to do something with him she hardly knew what There was so much of him he was so rich and robust so easy friendly well disposed that he kept her fancy constantly on the alert For the present the only thing she could do was to like him She told him that he was horribly Western but in this compliment the adverb was tinged with insincerity She led him about with her introduced him to fifty people and took extreme satisfaction in her conquest Newman accepted every proposal shook hands universally and promiscuously and seemed equally unfamiliar with trepidation or with elation Tom Tristram complained of his wife s avidity and declared that he could never have a clear five minutes with his friend If he had known how things were going to turn out he never would have brought him to the Avenue d I na The two men formerly had not been intimate but Newman remembered his earlier impression of his host and did Mrs Tristram who had by no means taken him into her confidence but whose secret he presently discovered the justice to admit that her husband was a rather degenerate mortal At twenty five he had been a good fellow and in this respect he was unchanged but of a man of his age one expected something more People said he was sociable but this was as much a matter of course as for a dipped sponge to expand and it was not a high order of sociability He was a great gossip and tattler and to produce a laugh would hardly have spared the reputation of his aged mother Newman had a kindness for old memories but he found it impossible not to perceive that Tristram was nowadays a very light weight His only aspirations were to hold out at poker at his club to know the names of all the cocottes to shake hands all round to ply his rosy gullet with truffles and champagne and to create uncomfortable eddies and obstructions among the constituent atoms of the American colony He was shamefully idle spiritless sensual snobbish He irritated our friend by the tone of his allusions to their native country and Newman was at a loss to understand why the United States were not good enough for Mr Tristram He had never been a very conscious patriot but it vexed him to see them treated as little better than a vulgar smell in his friend s nostrils and he finally broke out and swore that they were the greatest country in the world that they could put all Europe into their breeches pockets and that an American who spoke ill of them ought to be carried home in irons and compelled to live in Boston This for Newman was putting it very vindictively Tristram was a comfortable man to snub he bore no malice and he continued to insist on Newman s finishing his evening at the Occidental Club Christopher Newman dined several times in the Avenue d I na and his host always proposed an early adjournment to this institution Mrs Tristram protested and declared that her husband exhausted his ingenuity in trying to displease her Oh no I never try my love he answered I know you loathe me quite enough when I take my chance Newman hated to see a husband and wife on these terms and he was sure one or other of them must be very unhappy He knew it was not Tristram Mrs Tristram had a balcony before her windows upon which during the June evenings she was fond of sitting and Newman used frankly to say that he preferred the balcony to the club It had a fringe of perfumed plants in tubs and enabled you to look up the broad street and see the Arch of Triumph vaguely massing its heroic sculptures in the summer starlight Sometimes Newman kept his promise of following Mr Tristram in half an hour to the Occidental and sometimes he forgot it His hostess asked him a great many questions about himself but on this subject he was an indifferent talker He was not what is called subjective though when he felt that her interest was sincere he made an almost heroic attempt to be He told her a great many things he had done and regaled her with anecdotes of Western life she was from Philadelphia and with her eight years in Paris talked of herself as a languid Oriental But some other person was always the hero of the tale by no means always to his advantage and Newman s own emotions were but scantily chronicled She had an especial wish to know whether he had ever been in love seriously passionately and failing to gather any satisfaction from his allusions she at last directly inquired He hesitated a while and at last he said No She declared that she was delighted to hear it as it confirmed her private conviction that,henryJames
in any way deceived him Then with a groan of anguish he sank to his knees There sure enough through the crack in the broken stone were protruding a multitude of threads of golden hair just tinged with grey He was disturbed by a noise at the door and looking round saw his wife standing in the doorway In the desperation of the moment he took action to prevent discovery and lighting a match at the lamp stooped down and burned away the hair that rose through the broken stone Then rising nonchalantly as he could he pretended surprise at seeing his wife beside him For the next week he lived in an agony for whether by accident or design he could not find himself alone in the hall for any length of time At each visit the hair had grown afresh through the crack and he had to watch it carefully lest his terrible secret should be discovered He tried to find a receptacle for the body of the murdered woman outside the house but someone always interrupted him and once when he was coming out of the private doorway he was met by his wife who began to question him about it and manifested surprise that she should not have before noticed the key which he now reluctantly showed her Geoffrey dearly and passionately loved his wife so that any possibility of her discovering his dread secrets or even of doubting him filled him with anguish and after a couple of days had passed he could not help coming to the conclusion that at least she suspected something That very evening she came into the hall after her drive and found him there sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace She spoke to him directly Geoffrey I have been spoken to by that fellow Delandre and he says horrible things He tells to me that a week ago his sister returned to his house the wreck and ruin of her former self with only her golden hair as of old and announced some fell intention He asked me where she is and oh Geoffrey she is dead she is dead So how can she have returned Oh I am in dread and I know not where to turn For answer Geoffrey burst into a torrent of blasphemy which made her shudder He cursed Delandre and his sister and all their kind and in especial he hurled curse after curse on her golden hair Oh hush hush she said and was then silent for she feared her husband when she saw the evil effect of his humour Geoffrey in the torrent of his anger stood up and moved away from the hearth but suddenly stopped as he saw a new look of terror in his wife s eyes He followed their glance and then he too shuddered for there on the broken hearth stone lay a golden streak as the point of the hair rose though the crack Look look she shrieked Is it some ghost of the dead Come away come away and seizing her husband by the wrist with the frenzy of madness she pulled him from the room That night she was in a raging fever The doctor of the district attended her at once and special aid was telegraphed for to London Geoffrey was in despair and in his anguish at the danger of his young wife almost forgot his own crime and its consequences In the evening the doctor had to leave to attend to others but he left Geoffrey in charge of his wife His last words were Remember you must humour her till I come in the morning or till some other doctor has her case in hand What you have to dread is another attack of emotion See that she is kept warm Nothing more can be done Late in the evening when the rest of the household had retired Geoffrey s wife got up from her bed and called to her husband Come she said Come to the old hall I know where the gold comes from I want to see it grow Geoffrey would fain have stopped her but he feared for her life or reason on the one hand and lest in a paroxysm she should shriek out her terrible suspicion and seeing that it was useless to try to prevent her wrapped a warm rug around her and went with her to the old hall When they entered she turned and shut the door and locked it We want no strangers amongst us three tonight she whispered with a wan smile We three nay we are but two said Geoffrey with a shudder he feared to say more Sit here said his wife as she put out the light Sit here by the hearth and watch the gold growing The silver moonlight is jealous See it steals along the floor towards the gold our gold Geoffrey looked with growing horror and saw that during the hours that had passed the golden hair had protruded further through the broken hearth stone He tried to hide it by placing his feet over the broken place and his wife drawing her chair beside him leant over and laid her head on his shoulder Now do not stir dear she said let us sit still and watch We shall find the secret of the growing gold He passed his arm round her and sat silent and as the moonlight stole along the floor she sank to sleep He feared to wake her and so sat silent and miserable as the hours stole away Before his horror struck eyes the golden hair from the broken stone grew and grew and as it increased so his heart got colder and colder till at last he had not power to stir and sat with eyes full of terror watching his doom In the morning when the London doctor came neither Geoffrey nor his wife could,bramStoker
discovered an express wagon standing in front of the door when he went home about noon to see if Marie had come back Before he had recovered to the point of profane speech the express man appeared coming out of the house bent nearly double under the weight of Marie s trunk Behind him in the doorway Bud got a glimpse of Marie s mother That settled it Bud turned around and hurried to the nearest drayage company and ordered a domestic wrecking crew to the scene in other words a packer and two draymen and a dray He d show em Marie and her mother couldn t put anything over on him he d stand over that furniture with a sheriff first He went back and found Marie s mother still there packing dishes and doilies and the like They had a terrible row and all the nearest neighbors inclined ears to doors ajar getting an earful as Bud contemptuously put it He finally led Marie s mother to the front door and set her firmly outside Told her that Marie had come to him with no more than the clothes she had and that his money had bought every teaspoon and every towel and every stick of furniture in the darned place and he d be everlastingly thus and so if they were going to strong arm the stuff off him now If Marie was too good to live with him why his stuff was too good for her to have Oh yes the neighbors certainly got an earful as the town gossips proved when the divorce suit seeped into the papers Bud refused to answer the proceedings and was therefore ordered to pay twice as much alimony as he could afford to pay more in fact than all his domestic expense had amounted to in the fourteen months that he had been married Also Marie was awarded the custody of the child and because Marie s mother had represented Bud to be a violent man who was a menace to her daughter s safety and proved it by the neighbors who had seen and heard so much Bud was served with a legal paper that wordily enjoined him from annoying Marie with his presence That unnecessary insult snapped the last thread of Bud s regret for what had happened He sold the furniture and the automobile took the money to the judge that had tried the case told the judge a few wholesome truths and laid the pile of money on the desk That cleans me out Judge he said stolidly I wasn t such a bad husband at that I got sore but I ll bet you get sore yourself and tell your wife what for now and then I didn t get a square deal but that s all right I m giving a better deal than I got Now you can keep that money and pay it out to Marie as she needs it for herself and the kid But for the Lord s sake Judge don t let that wildcat of a mother of hers get her fingers into the pile She framed this deal thinking she d get a haul outa me this way I m asking you to block that little game I ve held out ten dollars to eat on till I strike something I m clean they ve licked the platter and broke the dish So don t never ask me to dig up any more because I won t not for you nor no other darn man Get that This you must know was not in the courtroom so Bud was not fined for contempt The judge was a married man himself and he may have had a sympathetic understanding of Bud s position At any rate he listened unofficially and helped Bud out with the legal part of it so that Bud walked out of the judge s office financially free even though he had a suspicion that his freedom would not bear the test of prosperity and that Marie s mother would let him alone only so long as he and prosperity were strangers CHAPTER THREE TEN DOLLARS AND A JOB FOR BUD To withhold for his own start in life only one ten dollar bill from fifteen hundred dollars was spectacular enough to soothe even so bruised an ego as Bud Moore carried into the judge s office There is an anger which carries a person to the extreme of self sacrifice in the subconscious hope of exciting pity for one so hardly used Bud was boiling with such an anger and it demanded that he should all but give Marie the shirt off his back since she had demanded so much and for so slight a cause Bud could not see for the life of him why Marie should have quit for that little ruction It was not their first quarrel nor their worst certainly he had not expected it to be their last Why he asked the high heavens had she told him to bring home a roll of cotton if she was going to leave him Why had she turned her back on that little home that had seemed to mean as much to her as it had to him Being kin to primitive man Bud could only bellow rage when he should have analyzed calmly the situation He should have seen that Marie too had cabin fever induced by changing too suddenly from carefree girlhood to the ills and irks of wifehood and motherhood He should have known that she had been for two months wholly dedicated to the small physical wants of their baby and that if his nerves were fraying with watching that incessant servitude her own must be close to the snapping point had snapped when dusk did not bring him home repentant But he did not know and so he blamed Marie bitterly for the wreck of,bmBower
colored woman arrested for drunkenness were summarily disposed of and the next case was called The policeman who had arrested Dick presented himself with our hero Dick was so neatly dressed and looked so modest and self possessed that the judge surveyed him with some surprise What is this lad charged with he demanded With taking a wallet from a gentleman s pocket said the policeman Did you arrest him I did Did you take him in the act No I did not see him take it What have you to say prisoner Are you guilty or not guilty said the judge turning to Dick Not guilty said Dick quietly State why you made the arrest said the judge I saw him with the wallet in his hand Is the gentleman who had his pocket picked present He is Summon him The red faced man came forward and gave his testimony He stated that he was standing on the sidewalk when he felt a hand thrust into his pocket and forcibly withdrawn He immediately felt for his wallet and found it gone Turning he saw a boy running and immediately gave chase Was the boy you saw running the prisoner I suppose it was You suppose Don t you know Of course it was or he would not have been found with the wallet in his hand But you can not identify him from personal observation The red faced man admitted with some reluctance that his eyesight was very poor and he did not catch sight of the boy till he was too far off to be identified This is not so clear as it might be said the judge Still appearances are against the prisoner and as the wallet was found in his possession he must be found guilty unless that fact can be satisfactorily explained I have a witness who can explain it said Dick Where is he Tim Ryan who understood that his evidence was now wanted came forward After being sworn the judge asked What is your name Tim Ryan sir Where do you live In Mulberry Street Tell what you know of this case I was standing in Chatham Street when I saw the ould gintleman with the red face here the prosecutor scowled at Tim not relishing the description which was given of him standing at the corner of Pearl Street A boy came up and put his hand into his pocket and then run away as fast as his legs could carry him wid the wallet in his hand Who was this boy Do you know him Yes sir Tell his name It was Micky Maguire said Tim reluctantly And who is Micky Maguire He blacks boots Then if this Micky Maguire took the wallet how happened it that it was found in this boy s possession I can tell that said Tim I ran after Micky to see if he d get off wid the wallet He hadn t gone but a little way when I saw him slip it into Dick s pocket I suppose you mean by Dick the prisoner at the bar Yes sir And what became of this Micky He stopped runnin after he d got rid of the pocket book and a minute after up came the copp and took Dick Why didn t you come forward and explain the mistake I was afraid Micky d beat me Do you know this Micky Maguire said the judge turning to the officer I do What is his reputation Bad He s been at the Island three or four times already Did you see him anywhere about when you made the arrest I did Do you know this boy who has just testified Yes He is a good boy The case seems a clear one The prisoner is discharged from custody Arrest Micky Maguire on the same charge as early as possible The next case was called and Dick was free Mr Murdock came forward and took him by the hand which he shook heartily I congratulate you on your acquittal he said I feel a little better than I did said Dick Tim you re a good fellow he said clasping Tim s hand I wouldn t have got off if it hadn t been for you I ought to do that much for you Dick when you ve been so kind to me How are you getting along now Tim Pretty well Mother s got so she can work and we re doin well When she was sick it was pretty hard Here s something to help you along said Dick and he drew a bill from his pocket Five dollars said Tim in surprise You can buy some new clothes Tim I ought not to take so much as that Dick It s all right Tim There s some more where that comes from They were in Centre Street by this time Fosdick came up hurriedly Have you got off Dick he asked eagerly Yes Fosdick There s no chance of my being entertained at the expense of the city I didn t expect the trial was coming off so early Tell me all about it What did they say at the house at my being away asked Dick Miss Peyton inquired particularly after you I said as you directed me that you were detained by important business What did she say then Dick was so particular in his inquiries fearing lest any suspicion should have been formed of the real cause which had detained him There was no reason for it but it had always been a matter of pride with him in his vagabond days that he had never been arrested on any charge and it troubled him that he should even have been suspected of theft You are fishing for compliments Dick said Fosdick How do you make that out You want to know what Miss Peyton said I believe you are getting,horatioAlger
Dr Green Have to come to us and the mercury now Dr Green Natur Y a r b s Did I hear something about herbs and herb doctors here said a flute like voice advancing It was the herb doctor in person Carpet bag in hand he happened to be strolling back that way Pardon me addressing the Missourian but if I caught your words aright you would seem to have little confidence in nature which really in my way of thinking looks like carrying the spirit of distrust pretty far And who of my sublime species may you be turning short round upon him clicking his rifle lock with an air which would have seemed half cynic half wild cat were it not for the grotesque excess of the expression which made its sincerity appear more or less dubious One who has confidence in nature and confidence in man with some little modest confidence in himself That s your Confession of Faith is it Confidence in man eh Pray which do you think are most knaves or fools Having met with few or none of either I hardly think I am competent to answer I will answer for you Fools are most Why do you think so For the same reason that I think oats are numerically more than horses Don t knaves munch up fools just as horses do oats A droll sir you are a droll I can appreciate drollery ha ha ha But I m in earnest That s the drollery to deliver droll extravagance with an earnest air knaves munching up fools as horses oats Faith very droll indeed ha ha ha Yes I think I understand you now sir How silly I was to have taken you seriously in your droll conceits too about having no confidence in nature In reality you have just as much as I have I have confidence in nature I I say again there is nothing I am more suspicious of I once lost ten thousand dollars by nature Nature embezzled that amount from me absconded with ten thousand dollars worth of my property a plantation on this stream swept clean away by one of those sudden shiftings of the banks in a freshet ten thousand dollars worth of alluvion thrown broad off upon the waters But have you no confidence that by a reverse shifting that soil will come back after many days ah here is my venerable friend observing the old miser not in your berth yet Pray if you will keep afoot don t lean against that baluster take my arm It was taken and the two stood together the old miser leaning against the herb doctor with something of that air of trustful fraternity with which when standing the less strong of the Siamese twins habitually leans against the other The Missourian eyed them in silence which was broken by the herb doctor You look surprised sir Is it because I publicly take under my protection a figure like this But I am never ashamed of honesty whatever his coat Look you said the Missourian after a scrutinizing pause you are a queer sort of chap Don t know exactly what to make of you Upon the whole though you somewhat remind me of the last boy I had on my place Good trustworthy boy I hope Oh very I am now started to get me made some kind of machine to do the sort of work which boys are supposed to be fitted for Then you have passed a veto upon boys And men too But my dear sir does not that again imply more or less lack of confidence Stand up a little just a very little my venerable friend you lean rather hard No confidence in boys no confidence in men no confidence in nature Pray sir who or what may you have confidence in I have confidence in distrust more particularly as applied to you and your herbs Well with a forbearing smile that is frank But pray don t forget that when you suspect my herbs you suspect nature Didn t I say that before Very good For the argument s sake I will suppose you are in earnest Now can you who suspect nature deny that this same nature not only kindly brought you into being but has faithfully nursed you to your present vigorous and independent condition Is it not to nature that you are indebted for that robustness of mind which you so unhandsomely use to her scandal Pray is it not to nature that you owe the very eyes by which you criticise her No for the privilege of vision I am indebted to an oculist who in my tenth year operated upon me in Philadelphia Nature made me blind and would have kept me so My oculist counterplotted her And yet sir by your complexion I judge you live an out of door life without knowing it you are partial to nature you fly to nature the universal mother Very motherly Sir in the passion fits of nature I ve known birds fly from nature to me rough as I look yes sir in a tempest refuge here smiting the folds of his bearskin Fact sir fact Come come Mr Palaverer for all your palavering did you yourself never shut out nature of a cold wet night Bar her out Bolt her out Lint her out As to that said the herb doctor calmly much may be said Say it then ruffling all his hairs You can t sir can t Then as in apostrophe Look you nature I don t deny but your clover is sweet and your dandelions don t roar but whose hailstones smashed my windows Sir with unimpaired affability producing one of his boxes I am pained to meet with one who holds nature a dangerous character Though your manner is refined your voice is rough in short you seem

I believe your father I doubt not he can lie I doubt not he doth lie upon occasion for the best of us do that but there is no occasion here A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought But come sith it is thy humour to give over begging wherewithal shall we busy ourselves With robbing kitchens The King said impatiently Have done with this folly you weary me Hugo replied with temper Now harkee mate you will not beg you will not rob so be it But I will tell you what you will do You will play decoy whilst I beg Refuse an you think you may venture The King was about to reply contemptuously when Hugo said interrupting Peace Here comes one with a kindly face Now will I fall down in a fit When the stranger runs to me set you up a wail and fall upon your knees seeming to weep then cry out as all the devils of misery were in your belly and say Oh sir it is my poor afflicted brother and we be friendless o God s name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick forsaken and most miserable wretch bestow one little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to perish and mind you keep you on wailing and abate not till we bilk him of his penny else shall you rue it Then immediately Hugo began to moan and groan and roll his eyes and reel and totter about and when the stranger was close at hand down he sprawled before him with a shriek and began to writhe and wallow in the dirt in seeming agony O dear O dear cried the benevolent stranger O poor soul poor soul how he doth suffer There let me help thee up O noble sir forbear and God love you for a princely gentleman but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so My brother there will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be upon me A penny dear sir a penny to buy a little food then leave me to my sorrows A penny thou shalt have three thou hapless creature and he fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out There poor lad take them and most welcome Now come hither my boy and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house where I am not his brother said the King interrupting What not his brother Oh hear him groaned Hugo then privately ground his teeth He denies his own brother and he with one foot in the grave Boy thou art indeed hard of heart if this is thy brother For shame and he scarce able to move hand or foot If he is not thy brother who is he then A beggar and a thief He has got your money and has picked your pocket likewise An thou would st do a healing miracle lay thy staff over his shoulders and trust Providence for the rest But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle In a moment he was up and off like the wind the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry lustily as he went The King breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for his own release fled in the opposite direction and did not slacken his pace until he was out of harm s reach He took the first road that offered and soon put the village behind him He hurried along as briskly as he could during several hours keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder for pursuit but his fears left him at last and a grateful sense of security took their place He recognised now that he was hungry and also very tired So he halted at a farmhouse but when he was about to speak he was cut short and driven rudely away His clothes were against him He wandered on wounded and indignant and was resolved to put himself in the way of like treatment no more But hunger is pride s master so as the evening drew near he made an attempt at another farmhouse but here he fared worse than before for he was called hard names and was promised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly The night came on chilly and overcast and still the footsore monarch laboured slowly on He was obliged to keep moving for every time he sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold All his sensations and experiences as he moved through the solemn gloom and the empty vastness of the night were new and strange to him At intervals he heard voices approach pass by and fade into silence and as he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless drifting blur there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that made him shudder Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light always far away apparently almost in another world if he heard the tinkle of a sheep s bell it was vague distant indistinct the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences a mournful sound now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest all sounds were remote they made the little King feel that all life and activity were far removed from him and that he stood solitary companionless in the centre of a measureless solitude He stumbled along through the gruesome fascinations of this new experience startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves overhead so like human whispers they seemed to sound and by and by he came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand,markTwain
any one And the paper The paper I prefer to keep myself said Mrs Brent nodding her head suspiciously I don t care to have my only proof destroyed Philip did not seem to take her meaning but with the daguerreotype in his hand he left the room I say mother chuckled Jonas his freckled face showing his enjoyment it s a good joke on Phil isn t it I guess he won t be quite so uppish after this CHAPTER III PHIL S SUDDEN RESOLUTION When Phil left the presence of Mrs Brent he felt as if he had been suddenly transported to a new world He was no longer Philip Brent and the worst of it was that he did not know who he was In his tumultuous state of feeling however one thing seemed clear his prospects were wholly changed and his plans for the future also Mrs Brent had told him that he was wholly dependent upon her Well he did not intend to remain so His home had not been pleasant at the best As a dependent upon the bounty of such a woman it would be worse He resolved to leave home and strike out for himself not from any such foolish idea of independence as sometimes leads boys to desert a good home for an uncertain skirmish with the world but simply be cause he felt now that he had no real home To begin with he would need money and on opening his pocket book he ascertained that his available funds consisted of only a dollar and thirty seven cents That wasn t quite enough to begin the world with But he had other resources He owned a gun which a friend of his would be ready to take off his hands He had a boat also which he could probably sell On the village street he met Reuben Gordon a young journeyman carpenter who was earning good wages and had money to spare How are you Phil said Reuben in a friendly way You are just the one I want to meet said Phil earnestly Didn t you tell me once you would like to buy my gun Yes Want to sell it No I don t but I want the money it will bring So I ll sell it if you ll buy What d ye want for it asked Reuben cautiously Six dollars Too much I ll give five You can have it said Phil after a pause How soon can you let me have the money Bring the gun round to night and I ll pay you for it All right Do you know of any one who wants to buy a boat What Going to sell that too Yes Seems to me you re closin up business said Reuben shrewdly So I am I m going to leave Planktown You don t say Well I declare Where are you goin To New York I guess Got any prospect there Yes This was not perhaps strictly true that is Phil had no definite prospect but he felt that there must be a chance in a large city like New York for any one who was willing to work and so felt measurably justified in saying what he did I hadn t thought of buyin a boat said Reuben thoughtfully Phil pricked up his ears at the hint of a possible customer You d better buy mine he said quickly I ll sell it cheap How cheap Ten dollars That s too much It cost me fifteen But it s second hand now you know said Reuben It s just as good as new I m taking off five dollars though you see I don t think I want it enough to pay ten dollars What will you give Reuben finally agreed to pay seven dollars and seventy five cents after more or less bargaining and to pay the money that evening upon delivery of the goods I don t think I ve got anything more to sell said Phil thoughtfully There s my skates but they are not very good I ll give them to Tommy Kavanagh He can t afford to buy a pair Tommy was the son of a poor widow and was very much pleased with the gift which Phil conveyed to him just before supper Just after supper he took his gun and the key of his boat over to Reuben Gordon who thereupon gave him the money agreed upon Shall I tell Mrs Brent I am going away Phil said to himself or shall I leave a note for her He decided to announce his resolve in person To do otherwise would seem too much like running away and that he had too much self respect to do So in the evening after his return from Reuben Gordon s he said to Mrs Brent I think I ought to tell you that I m going away to morrow Mrs Brent looked up from her work and her cold gray eyes surveyed Phil with curious scrutiny You are going away she replied Where are you going I think I shall go to New York What for Seek my fortune as so many have done before me They didn t always find it said Mrs Brent with a cold sneer Is there any other reason Yes it s chiefly on account of what you told me yesterday You said that I was dependent upon you So you are And that I wasn t even entitled to the name of Brent Yes I said it and it s true Well said Phil I don t want to be dependent upon you I prefer to earn my own living I am not prepared to say but that you are right But do you know what the neighbors will say What will they say That I drove you from home It won t be true I don t,horatioAlger
months he wandered about first in this direction and then in that without finding any traces of the dragon or his captive At last he came to a stream and as he stopped for a moment to look at it he noticed a little fish lying on the bank beating its tail convulsively in a vain effort to get back into the water Oh for pity s sake my brother shrieked the little creature help me and put me back into the river and I will repay you some day Take one of my scales and when you are in danger twist it in your fingers and I will come The prince picked up the fish and threw it into the water then he took off one of its scales as he had been told and put it in his pocket carefully wrapped in a cloth Then he went on his way till some miles further down the road he found a fox caught in a trap Oh be a brother to me called the fox and free me from this trap and I will help you when you are in need Pull out one of my hairs and when you are in danger twist it in your fingers and I will come So the prince unfastened the trap pulled out one of the fox s hairs and continued his journey And as he was going over the mountain he passed a wolf entangled in a snare who begged to be set at liberty Only deliver me from death he said and you will never be sorry for it Take a lock of my fur and when you need me twist it in your fingers And the prince undid the snare and let the wolf go For a long time he walked on without having any more adventures till at length he met a man travelling on the same road Oh brother asked the prince tell me if you can where the dragon emperor lives The man told him where he would find the palace and how long it would take him to get there and the prince thanked him and followed his directions till that same evening he reached the town where the dragon emperor lived When he entered the palace to his great joy he found his wife sitting alone in a vast hall and they began hastily to invent plans for her escape There was no time to waste as the dragon might return directly so they took two horses out of the stable and rode away at lightning speed Hardly were they out of sight of the palace than the dragon came home and found that his prisoner had flown He sent at once for his talking horse and said to him Give me your advice what shall I do have my supper as usual or set out in pursuit of them Eat your supper with a free mind first answered the horse and follow them afterwards So the dragon ate till it was past mid day and when he could eat no more he mounted his horse and set out after the fugitives In a short time he had come up with them and as he snatched the empress out of her saddle he said to the prince This time I will forgive you because you brought me the water when I was in the cask but beware how you return here or you will pay for it with your life Half mad with grief the prince rode sadly on a little further hardly knowing what he was doing Then he could bear it no longer and turned back to the palace in spite of the dragon s threats Again the empress was sitting alone and once more they began to think of a scheme by which they could escape the dragon s power Ask the dragon when he comes home said the prince where he got that wonderful horse from and then you can tell me and I will try to find another like it Then fearing to meet his enemy he stole out of the castle Soon after the dragon came home and the empress sat down near him and began to coax and flatter him into a good humour and at last she said But tell me about that wonderful horse you were riding yesterday There can not be another like it in the whole world Where did you get it from And he answered The way I got it is a way which no one else can take On the top of a high mountain dwells an old woman who has in her stables twelve horses each one more beautiful than the other And in one corner is a thin wretched looking animal whom no one would glance at a second time but he is in reality the best of the lot He is twin brother to my own horse and can fly as high as the clouds themselves But no one can ever get this horse without first serving the old woman for three whole days And besides the horses she has a foal and its mother and the man who serves her must look after them for three whole days and if he does not let them run away he will in the end get the choice of any horse as a present from the old woman But if he fails to keep the foal and its mother safe on any one of the three nights his head will pay The next day the prince watched till the dragon left the house and then he crept in to the empress who told him all she had learnt from her gaoler The prince at once determined to seek the old woman on the top of the mountain and lost no time in setting out It was a long and steep climb but at last he found her and with a,andrewLang
said bluntly You never liked Jack queried Columbine slowly That was not what she wanted to say but the thought spoke itself I should smile I never did Ever since you and he fought long ago all over His sharp gesture made the coiled lasso loosen Ever since I licked him good don t forget that interrupted Wilson The red had faded from the bronze Yes you licked him mused Columbine I remember that And Jack s hated you ever since There s been no love lost But Wils you never before talked this way spoke out so against Jack she protested Well I m not the kind to talk behind a fellow s back But I m not mealy mouthed either and and He did not complete the sentence and his meaning was enigmatic Altogether Moore seemed not like himself The fact disturbed Columbine Always she had confided in him Here was a most complex situation she burned to tell him yet somehow feared to she felt an incomprehensible satisfaction in his bitter reference to Jack she seemed to realize that she valued Wilson s friendship more than she had known and now for some strange reason it was slipping from her We we were such good friends pards said Columbine hurriedly and irrelevantly Who He stared at her Why you and me Oh His tone softened but there was still disapproval in his glance What of that Something has happened to make me think I ve missed you lately that s all Ahuh His tone held finality and bitterness but he would not commit himself Columbine sensed a pride in him that seemed the cause of his aloofness Wilson why have you been different lately she asked plaintively What s the good to tell you now he queried in reply That gave her a blank sense of actual loss She had lived in dreams and he in realities Right now she could not dispel her dream see and understand all that he seemed to She felt like a child then growing old swiftly The strange past longing for a mother surged up in her like a strong tide Some one to lean on some one who loved her some one to help her in this hour

clumsy hands He did not look at her His tone expressed anger and amaze Dad says I must marry Jack she said with a sudden return to her natural simplicity I heard him tell that months ago snapped Moore

any more after dad said that she queried Columbine a girl nineteen years and about to to get married ought not be a fool he replied with sarcasm I m not a fool she rejoined hotly You ask fool questions Well you didn t like me afterward or you d never have mistreated me If you say I mistreated you you say what s untrue he replied just as hotly They had never been so near a quarrel before Columbine experienced a sensation new to her a commingling of fear heat and pang it seemed all in one throb Wilson was hurting her A quiver ran all over her along her veins swelling and tingling You mean I lie she flashed Yes I do if But before he could conclude she slapped his face It grew pale then while she began to tremble Oh I didn t intend that Forgive me she faltered He rubbed his cheek The hurt had not been great so far as the blow was concerned But his eyes were dark with pain and anger Oh don t distress yourself he burst out You slapped me before once years ago for kissing you I I apologize for saying you lied You re only out of your head So am I That poured oil upon the troubled waters The cowboy appeared to be hesitating between sudden flight and the risk of staying longer Maybe that s it replied Columbine with a half laugh She was not far from tears and fury with herself Let us make up be friends again Moore squared around aggressively He seemed to fortify himself against something in her She felt that But his face grew harder and older than she had ever seen it Columbine do you know where Jack Belllounds has been for these three years he asked deliberately entirely ignoring her overtures of friendship No Somebody said Denver Some one else said Kansas City I never asked dad because I knew Jack had been sent away I ve supposed he was working making a man

a young man of serious demeanor with a smooth shaven face and a square determined jaw There was something about him which seemed familiar but Van Bibber could not determine just what it was The elevator stopped to allow some people to leave it at the second floor and as the young man shoved the door to again Van Bibber asked him if he happened to know of a chambermaid with red hair a tall girl on the seventh floor a girl who danced very well The wire rope of the elevator slipped less rapidly through the hands of the young man who controlled it and he turned and fixed his eyes with sudden interest on Van Bibber s face and scrutinized him and his companion with serious consideration Yes I know her I know who you mean anyway he said Why Why echoed Van Bibber raising his eyes We wish to see her on a matter of business Can you tell me her name The elevator was running so slowly now that its movement upward was barely perceptible Her name s Annie Annie Crehan Excuse me said the young man doubtfully ain t you the young fellows who came to our ball with that English lady the one that sung Yes Van Bibber assented pleasantly We were there That s where I ve seen you before You were there too weren t you Me and Annie was dancing together most all the evening I seen all youse watching her Of course exclaimed Van Bibber I remember you now Oh then you must know her quite well Maybe you can help us We want to put her on the stage The elevator came to a stop with an abrupt jerk and the young man shoved his hands behind him and leaned back against one of the mirrors in its side On the stage he repeated Why Van Bibber smiled and shrugged his shoulders in some embarrassment at this peremptory challenge But there was nothing in the young man s tone or manner that could give offence He seemed much in earnest and spoke as though they must understand that he had some right to question Why Because of her dancing She is a very remarkable dancer All of those actors with

give her a trial And if she needs money to pay for lessons or to buy the proper dresses and slippers and things we are willing to give it to her or to lend it to her if she would like that better Why repeated the young man immovably His manner was not encouraging Why what interrupted Travers with growing impatience Why are you willing to give her money You don t know her Van Bibber looked at Travers and Travers smiled in some annoyance The electric bell rang violently from different floors but the young man did not heed it He had halted the elevator between two landings and he now seated himself on the velvet cushions and crossed one leg over the other as though for a protracted debate Travers gazed about him in humorous apprehension as though alarmed at the position in which he found himself hung as it were between the earth and sky I swear I am an unarmed man he said in a whisper Our intentions are well meant I assure you said Van Bibber with an amused smile The girl is working ten hours a day for very little money isn t she You know she is when she could make a great deal of money by working half as hard We have some influence with theatrical people and we meant merely to put her in the way of bettering her position and to give her the chance to do something which she can do better than many others while almost any one I take it can sweep and make beds If she were properly managed she could become a great dancer and delight thousands of people add to the gayety of nations as it were She s hardly doing that now is she Have you any objections to that What right have you to make objections anyway The young man regarded the two young gentlemen before him with a dogged countenance but there was now in his eyes a look of helplessness and of great disquietude We re engaged to be married Annie and me he said That s it Oh exclaimed Van Bibber I beg your pardon That s different Well in that case you can help us very much if you wish We leave it entirely with you I don t want that you should leave it with me said the young man harshly I don t want to have nothing to do with it Annie can speak for herself I knew it was coming to this he said leaning forward and clasping his hands together or something like this I ve never felt dead sure of Annie never once I always knew something would happen Why nothing has happened said Van Bibber soothingly You would both benefit by it We would be as willing to help two as one You would both be better off The young man raised his head and stared at Van Bibber reprovingly You know better than that he said You know what I d look like Of course she could make money as a dancer I ve known that for some time but she hasn t thought of it yet and she d never have thought of it herself But the question isn t me or what I want It s Annie Is she going to be happier or not that s the question And I m telling you that she couldn t be,richardHarding
and the two men ate their dinner in silence each considering what the coming of the strangers might mean to him As he was leaving the room MacWilliams stopped and hovered uncertainly in the doorway Are you going to get yourself into a dress suit to night he asked Clay said that he thought he would he wanted to feel quite clean once more Well all right then the other returned reluctantly I ll do it for this once if you mean to but you needn t think I m going to make a practice of it for I m not I haven t worn a dress suit he continued as though explaining his principles in the matter since your spread when we opened the railroad that s six months ago and the time before that I wore one at MacGolderick s funeral MacGolderick blew himself up at Puerto Truxillo shooting rocks for the breakwater We never found all of him but we gave what we could get together as fine a funeral as those natives ever saw The boys they wanted to make him look respectable so they asked me to lend them my dress suit but I told them I meant to wear it myself That s how I came to wear a dress suit at a funeral It was either me or MacGolderick MacWilliams said Clay as he stuck the toe of one boot into the heel of the other if I had your imagination I d give up railroading and take to writing war clouds for the newspapers Do you mean you don t believe that story MacWilliams demanded sternly I do said Clay I mean I don t Well let it go returned MacWilliams gloomily but there s been funerals for less than that let me tell you A half hour later MacWilliams appeared in the door and stood gazing attentively at Clay arranging his tie before a hand glass and then at himself in his unusual apparel No wonder you voted to dress up he exclaimed finally in a tone of personal injury That s not a dress suit you ve got on anyway It hasn t any tails And I hope for your sake Mr Clay he continued his voice rising in plaintive indignation that you are not going to play that scarf on us for a vest And you haven t got a high collar on either That s only a rough blue print of a dress suit Why you look just as comfortable as though you were going to enjoy yourself and you look cool too Well why not laughed Clay Well but look at me cried the other Do I look cool Do I look happy or comfortable No I don t I look just about the way I feel like a fool undertaker I m going to take this thing right off You and Ted Langham can wear your silk scarfs and bobtail coats if you like but if they don t want me in white duck they don t get me When they reached the Palms Clay asked Miss Langham if she did not want to see his view And perhaps if you appreciate it properly I will make you a present of it he said as he walked before her down the length of the veranda It would be very selfish to keep it all to my self she said Couldn t we share it They had left the others seated facing the bay with MacWilliams and young Langham on the broad steps of the veranda and the younger sister and her father sitting in long bamboo steamer chairs above them Clay and Miss Langham were quite alone From the high cliff on which the Palms stood they could look down the narrow inlet that joined the ocean and see the moonlight turning the water into a rippling ladder of light and gilding the dark green leaves of the palms near them with a border of silver Directly below them lay the waters of the bay reflecting the red and green lights of the ships at anchor and beyond them again were the yellow lights of the town rising one above the other as the city crept up the hill And back of all were the mountains grim and mysterious with white clouds sleeping in their huge valleys like masses of fog Except for the ceaseless murmur of the insect life about them the night was absolutely still so still that the striking of the ships bells in the harbor came to them sharply across the surface of the water and they could hear from time to time the splash of some great fish and the steady creaking of an oar in a rowlock that grew fainter and fainter as it grew further away until it was drowned in the distance Miss Langham was for a long time silent She stood with her hands clasped behind her gazing from side to side into the moonlight and had apparently forgotten that Clay was present Well he said at last I think you appreciate it properly I was afraid you would exclaim about it and say it was fine or charming or something Miss Langham turned to him and smiled slightly And you told me once that you knew me so very well she said Clay chose to forget much that he had said on that night when he had first met her He knew that he had been bold then and had dared to be so because he did not think he would see her again but now that he was to meet her every day through several months it seemed better to him that they should grow to know each other as they really were simply and sincerely and without forcing the situation in any way So he replied I don t know you so well now You must

by storm and at once granted everything It has raised the English colonel s popularity with his men to fever heat This from the Times London Our Belgrade correspondent telegraphs last night There is here at present a gentleman named MacIver He came from England to offer himself and his sword to the Servians The Servian Minister of War gave him a colonel s commission This morning I saw him drilling about one hundred and fifty remarkably fine looking fellows all clad in a good serviceable cavalry uniform and he has horses Later we find that Colonel MacIver s Legion of Cavalry organizing here now numbers over two hundred men And again Prince Nica a Roumanian cousin of the Princess Natalie of Servia has joined Colonel MacIver s cavalry corps Later in the Court Journal October we read Colonel MacIver who a few years ago was very well known in military circles in Dublin now is making his mark with the Servian army In the war against the Turks he commands about one thousand Russo Servian cavalry He was next to receive the following honors Colonel MacIver has been appointed commander of the cavalry of the Servian armies on the Morava and Timok and has received the Cross of the Takovo Order from General Tchemaieff for gallant conduct in the field and the gold medal for valor Later we learn from the Daily News Mr Lewis Farley Secretary of the League in Aid of Christians of Turkey has received the following letter dated Belgrade October DEAR SIR In reference to the embroidered banner so kindly worked by an English lady and forwarded by the League to Colonel MacIver I have great pleasure in conveying to you the following particulars On Sunday morning the flag having been previously consecrated by the archbishop was conducted by a guard of honor to the palace and Colonel MacIver in the presence of Prince Milan and a numerous suite in the name and on behalf of yourself and the fair donor delivered it into the hands of the Princess Natalie The gallant Colonel wore upon this occasion his full uniform as brigade commander and chief of cavalry of the Servian army and bore upon his breast the Gold Cross of Takovo which he received after the battles of the th and th of September in recognition of the heroism and bravery he displayed upon these eventful days The beauty of the decoration was enhanced by the circumstances of its bestowal for on the evening of the battle of the th General Tchernaieff approached Colonel MacIver and unclasping the cross from his own breast placed it upon that of the Colonel Signed HUGH JACKSON Member of Council of the League In Servia and in the Servian army MacIver reached what as yet is the highest point of his career and of his life the happiest period He was general de brigade which is not what we know as a brigade general but is one who commands a division a major general He was a great favorite both at the palace and with the people the pay was good fighting plentiful and Belgrade gay and amusing Of all the places he has visited and the countries he has served it is of this Balkan kingdom that the general seems to speak most fondly and with the greatest feeling Of Queen Natalie he was and is a most loyal and chivalric admirer and was ever ready when he found any one who did not as greatly respect the lady to offer him the choice of swords or pistols Even for Milan he finds an extenuating word After Servia the general raised more foreign legions planned further expeditions in Central America reorganized the small armies of the small republics served as United States Consul and offered his sword to President McKinley for use against Spain But with Servia the most active portion of the life of the general ceased and the rest has been a repetition of what went before At present his time is divided between New York and Virginia where he has been offered an executive position in the approaching Jamestown Exposition Both North and South he has many friends many admirers But his life is and from the nature of his profession must always be a lonely one While other men remain planted in one spot gathering about them a home sons and daughters an income for old age MacIver is a rolling stone a piece of floating sea weed as the present King of England called him fondly that vagabond soldier To a man who has lived in the saddle and upon transports neighbor conveys nothing and even comrade too often means one who is no longer living With the exception of the United States of which he now is a naturalized citizen the general has fought for nearly every country in the world but if any of those for which he lost his health and blood and for which he risked his life remembers him it makes no sign And the general is too proud to ask to be remembered To day there is no more interesting figure than this man who in years is still young enough to lead an army corps and who for forty years has been selling his sword and risking his life for presidents pretenders charlatans and emperors He finds some mighty changes Cuba which he fought to free is free men of the South with whom for four years he fought shoulder to shoulder are now wearing the blue the empire of Mexico for which he fought is a republic the empire of France for which he fought is a republic the empire of Brazil for which he fought is a republic the dynasty in Servia to which he owes his greatest honors has been wiped out by murder From none of the eighteen countries he has served has he a pension berth or billet and at sixty,richardHarding
the great hall with its slender pillars and gracious arching and clustering lamps was visible to her There over a wilderness of tables lay the huge maps done on so large a scale that one might fancy them small countries the messengers and attendants went and came perpetually altering moving the little pieces that signified hundreds and thousands of men and the great commander and his two consultants stood amidst all these things and near where the fighting was nearest scheming directing They had but to breathe a word and presently away there in the world of reality the punctual myriads moved Men rose up and went forward and died The fate of nations lay behind the eyes of these three men Indeed they were like gods Most godlike of the three was Dubois It was for him to decide the others at most might suggest Her woman s soul went out to this grave handsome still old man in a passion of instinctive worship Once she had taken words of instruction from him direct She had awaited them in an ecstasy of happiness and fear For her exaltation was made terrible by the dread that some error might dishonour her She watched him now through the glass with all the unpenetrating minuteness of an impassioned woman s observation He said little she remarked He looked but little at the maps The tall Englishman beside him was manifestly troubled by a swarm of ideas conflicting ideas he craned his neck at every shifting of the little red blue black and yellow pieces on the board and wanted to draw the commander s attention to this and that Dubois listened nodded emitted a word and became still again brooding like the national eagle His eyes were so deeply sunken under his white eyebrows that she could not see his eyes his moustache overhung the mouth from which those words of decision came Viard too said little he was a dark man with a drooping head and melancholy watchful eyes He was more intent upon the French right which was feeling its way now through Alsace to the Rhine He was she knew an old colleague of Dubois he knew him better she decided he trusted him more than this unfamiliar Englishman Not to talk to remain impassive and as far as possible in profile these were the lessons that old Dubois had mastered years ago To seem to know all to betray no surprise to refuse to hurry itself a confession of miscalculation by attention to these simple rules Dubois had built up a steady reputation from the days when he had been a promising junior officer a still almost abstracted young man deliberate but ready Even then men had looked at him and said He will go far Through fifty years of peace he had never once been found wanting and at man uvres his impassive persistence had perplexed and hypnotised and defeated many a more actively intelligent man Deep in his soul Dubois had hidden his one profound discovery about the modern art of warfare the key to his career And this discovery was that nobody knew that to act therefore was to blunder that to talk was to confess and that the man who acted slowly and steadfastly and above all silently had the best chance of winning through Meanwhile one fed the men Now by this same strategy he hoped to shatter those mysterious unknowns of the Central European command Delhi might talk of a great flank march through Holland with all the British submarines and hydroplanes and torpedo craft pouring up the Rhine in support of it Viard might crave for brilliance with the motor bicycles aeroplanes and ski men among the Swiss mountains and a sudden swoop upon Vienna the thing was to listen and wait for the other side to begin experimenting It was all experimenting And meanwhile he remained in profile with an air of assurance like a man who sits in an automobile after the chauffeur has had his directions And every one about him was the stronger and surer for that quiet face that air of knowledge and unruffled confidence The clustering lights threw a score of shadows of him upon the maps great bunches of him versions of a commanding presence lighter or darker dominated the field and pointed in every direction Those shadows symbolised his control When a messenger came from the wireless room to shift this or that piece in the game to replace under amended reports one Central European regiment by a score to draw back or thrust out or distribute this or that force of the Allies the Marshal would turn his head and seem not to see or look and nod slightly as a master nods who approves a pupil s self correction Yes that s better How wonderful he was thought the woman at

devotion and to have to be impersonal abstract exact punctual She must control herself She gave herself up to fantastic dreams dreams of the days when the war would be over and victory enthroned Then perhaps this harshness this armour would be put aside and the gods might unbend Her eyelids drooped She roused herself with a start She became aware that the night outside was no longer still That there was an excitement down below on the bridge and a running in the street and a flickering of searchlights among the clouds from some high place away beyond the Trocadero And then the excitement

can just walk in and out as you choose But Aunt Janet old Roger was cuter than any burglar He had the place so guarded that the burglar would have been a baffled burglar There are two steel shields which can slide out from the wall and lock into the other side right across the whole big window One is a grille of steel bands that open out into diamond shaped lozenges Nothing bigger than a kitten could get through and yet you can see the garden and the mountains and the whole view much the same as you ladies can see through your veils The other is a great sheet of steel which slides out in a similar way in different grooves It is not of course so heavy and strong as the safe door which covers the little opening in the main wall but Rooke tells me it is proof against the heaviest rifle hall Having told you this I must tell you too Aunt Janet lest you should be made anxious by the arriere pensee of all these warlike measures of defence that I always sleep at night with one of these iron screens across the window Of course when I am awake I leave it open As yet I have tried only but not used the grille and I don t think I shall ever use anything else for it is a perfect guard If it should be tampered with from outside it would sound an alarm at the head of the bed and the pressing of a button would roll out the solid steel screen in front of it As a matter of fact I have been so used to the open that I don t feel comfortable shut in I only close windows against cold or rain The weather here is delightful as yet at all events but they tell me that the rainy season will be on us before very long I think you will like my den aunty dear though it will doubtless be a worry to you to see it so untidy But that can t be helped I must be untidy somewhere and it is best in my own den Again I find my letter so long that I must cut it off now and go on again to night So this must go as it stands I shall not cause you to wait to hear all I can tell you about our new home Your loving RUPERT From Rupert Sent Leger Vissarion to Janet MacKelpie Croom January MY DEAR AUNT JANET My den looks out as I told you in my last letter on the garden or to speak more accurately on one of the gardens for there are acres of them This is the old one which must be almost as old as the Castle itself for it was within the defences in the old days of bows The wall that surrounds the inner portion of it has long ago been levelled but sufficient remains at either end where it joined the outer defences to show the long casemates for the bowmen to shoot through and the raised stone gallery where they stood It is just the same kind of building as the stone work of the sentry s walk on the roof and of the great old guard room under it But whatever the garden may have been and no matter how it was guarded it is a most lovely place There are whole sections of garden here of various styles Greek Italian French German Dutch British Spanish African Moorish all the older nationalities I am going to have a new one laid out for you a Japanese garden I have sent to the great gardener of Japan Minaro to make the plans for it and to come over with workmen to carry it out He is to bring trees and shrubs and flowers and stone work and everything that can be required and you shall superintend the finishing if not the doing of it yourself We have such a fine head of water here and the climate is they tell me usually so lovely that we can do anything in the gardening way If it should ever turn out that the climate does not suit we shall put a great high glass roof over it and make a suitable climate This garden in front of my room is the old Italian garden It must have been done with extraordinary taste and care for there is not a bit of it which is not rarely beautiful Sir Thomas Browne himself for all his Quincunx would have been delighted with it and have found material for another Garden of Cyrus It is so big that there are endless episodes of garden beauty I think all Italy must have been ransacked in old times for garden stone work of exceptional beauty and these treasures have been put together by some master hand Even the formal borders of the walks are of old porous stone which takes the weather staining so beautifully and are carved in endless variety Now that the gardens have been so long neglected or left in abeyance the green staining has become perfect Though the stone work is itself intact it has all the picturesque effect of the wear and ruin wrought by many centuries I am having it kept for you just as it is except that I have had the weeds and undergrowth cleared away so that its beauties might be visible But it is not merely the architect work of the garden that is so beautiful nor is the assembling there of the manifold wealth of floral beauty there is the beauty that Nature creates by the hand of her servant Time You see Aunt Janet how the beautiful garden inspires a danger hardened old tramp like me to high grade sentiments of poetic fancy Not only have limestone and sandstone and even,bramStoker
high compliments to Old Charley upon his sagacity and consideration As many of the burghers had brought spades with them supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse the drain was easily and speedily effected and no sooner was the bottom visible than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of Mr Pennifeather This waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr Shuttleworthy s departure for the city while there were others again ready to testify upon oath if required that Mr P did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr P s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr Shuttleworthy s disappearance Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr Pennifeather and it was observed as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him that he grew exceedingly pale and when asked what he had to say for himself was utterly incapable of saying a word Hereupon the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at once to a man and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest But on the other hand the magnanimity of Mr Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of Mr Pennifeather in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman the heir of the worthy Mr Shuttleworthy for the insult which he the young gentleman had no doubt in the heat of passion thought proper to put upon him Mr Goodfellow He forgave him for it he said from the very bottom of his heart and for himself Mr Goodfellow so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity which he was sorry to say really had arisen against Mr Pennifeather he Mr Goodfellow would make every exertion in his power would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to to to soften down as much as he could conscientiously do so the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business Mr Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart but your warm hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations they run into all sorts of blunders contre temps and mal apropos isms in the hot headedness of their zeal to serve a friend thus often with the kindest intentions in the world doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it So in the present instance it turned out with all the eloquence of Old Charley for although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected yet it so happened somehow or other that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded and to arouse against him the fury of the mob One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr Shuttleworthy The people had really never thought of this before They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle who had no living relative except the nephew and they had therefore always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled so single minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers but the remark of Old Charley brought them at once to a consideration of this point and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat And straightway hereupon arose the natural question of cui bono a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man And here lest I may be misunderstood permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed is invariably mistranslated and misconceived Cui bono in all the crack novels and elsewhere in those of Mrs Gore for example the author of Cecil a lady who quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw and is helped to her learning as needed upon a systematic plan by Mr Beckford in all the crack novels I say from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth the two little Latin words cui bono are rendered to what purpose or as if quo bono to what good Their true meaning nevertheless is for whose advantage Cui to whom bono is it for a benefit It is a purely legal phrase and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed s accomplishment Now in the present instance the question cui bono very pointedly implicated Mr Pennifeather His uncle had threatened him after making a will in his favour with disinheritance But the threat had not been actually kept the original will it appeared had not been altered Had it been altered the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge and even this would have been counteracted by the hope,allanPoe
and open to wind and weather looked out into a charming little secluded garden where an alabaster fountain sparkled among roses and myrtles and was surrounded by orange and citron trees some of which flung their branches into the chambers Beyond these rooms were two saloons longer but less lofty looking also into the garden In the compartments of the panelled ceilings were baskets of fruit and garlands of flowers painted by no mean hand and in tolerable preservation The walls also had been painted in fresco in the Italian style but the paintings were nearly obliterated the windows were in the same shattered state with those of the other chambers This fanciful suite of rooms terminated in an open gallery with balustrades running at right angles along another side of the garden The whole apartment so delicate and elegant in its decorations so choice and sequestered in its situation along this retired little garden and so different in architecture from the neighbouring halls awakened an interest in its history I found on inquiry that it was an apartment fitted up by Italian artists in the early part of the last century at the time when Philip V and his second wife the beautiful Elizabetta of Farnese daughter of the Duke of Parma were expected at the Alhambra It was destined for the queen and the ladies of her train One of the loftiest chambers had been her sleeping room A narrow staircase now walled up led up to a delightful belvidere originally a mirador of the Moorish sultanas communicating with the harem but which was fitted up as a boudoir for the fair Elizabetta and still retains the name of el tocador de la Reyna or the queen s toilette Illustration Illustration Garden of Lindaraxa Illustration Fountain of Lindaraxa One window of the royal sleeping room commanded a prospect of the Generalife and its embowered terraces another looked out into the little secluded garden I have mentioned which was decidedly Moorish in its character and also had its history It was in fact the garden of Lindaraxa so often mentioned in descriptions of the Alhambra but who this Lindaraxa was I had never heard explained A little research gave me the few particulars known about her She was a Moorish beauty who flourished in the court of Muhamed the Left Handed and was the daughter of his loyal adherent the alcayde of Malaga who sheltered him in his city when driven from the throne On regaining his crown the alcayde was rewarded for his fidelity His daughter had her apartment in the Alhambra and was given by the king in marriage to Nasar a young Cetimerien prince descended from Aben Hud the Just Their espousals were doubtless celebrated in the royal palace and their honeymoon may have passed among these very bowers Four centuries had elapsed since the fair Lindaraxa passed away yet how much of the fragile beauty of the scenes she inhabited remained The garden still bloomed in which she delighted the fountain still presented the crystal mirror in which her charms may once have been reflected the alabaster it is true had lost its whiteness the basin beneath overrun with weeds had become the lurking place of the lizard but there was something in the very decay that enhanced the interest of the scene speaking as it did of that mutability the irrevocable lot of man and all his works The desolation too of these chambers once the abode of the proud and elegant Elizabetta had a more touching charm for me than if I had beheld them in their pristine splendour glittering with the pageantry of a court When I returned to my quarters in the governor s apartment everything seemed tame and commonplace after the poetic region I had left The thought suggested itself Why could I not change my quarters to these vacant chambers that would indeed be living in the Alhambra surrounded by its gardens and fountains as in the time of the Moorish sovereigns I proposed the change to Dame Antonia and her family and it occasioned vast surprise They could not conceive any rational inducement for the choice of an apartment so forlorn remote and solitary Dolores exclaimed at its frightful loneliness nothing but bats and owls flitting about and then a fox and wildcat kept in the vaults of the neighbouring baths roamed about at night The good Tia had more reasonable objections The neighbourhood was infested by vagrants gipsies swarmed in the caverns of the adjacent hills the palace was ruinous and easy to be entered in many places the rumour of a stranger quartered alone in one of the remote and ruined apartments out of the hearing of the rest of the inhabitants might tempt unwelcome visitors in the night especially as foreigners were always supposed to be well stocked with money I was not to be diverted from my humour however and my will was law with these good people So calling in the assistance of a carpenter and the ever officious Mateo Ximenes the doors and windows were soon placed in a state of tolerable security and the sleeping room of the stately Elizabetta prepared for my reception Mateo kindly volunteered as a body guard to sleep in my antechamber but I did not think it worth while to put his valour to the proof Illustration Illustration Prospect from the Hall of Ambassadors With all the hardihood I had assumed and all the precautions I had taken I must confess the first night passed in these quarters was inexpressibly dreary I do not think it was so much the apprehension of dangers from without that affected me as the character of the place itself with all its strange associations the deeds of violence committed there the tragical ends of many of those who had once reigned there in splendour As I passed beneath the fated halls of the tower of Comares on the way to,whashingtonIrving
our local history occurred What is that if I may ask sir Certainly The principal landowner of our part of the county is on his way home and there will be a great home coming which you may care to see The fact is for more than a century the various owners in the succession here with the exception of a short time have lived abroad How is that sir if I may ask The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra Regis the family seat of the Caswall family The last owner who lived here was Edgar Caswall grandfather of the man who is coming here and he was the only one who stayed even a short time This man s grandfather also named Edgar they keep the tradition of the family Christian name quarrelled with his family and went to live abroad not keeping up any intercourse good or bad with his relatives although this particular Edgar as I told you did visit his family estate yet his son was born and lived and died abroad while his grandson the latest inheritor was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirty his present age This was the second line of absentees The great estate of Castra Regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five generations covering more than a hundred and twenty years It has been well administered however and no tenant or other connected with it has had anything of which to complain All the same there has been much natural anxiety to see the new owner and we are all excited about the event of his coming Even I am though I own my own estate which though adjacent is quite apart from Castra Regis Here we are now in new ground for you That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral and when we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county and you will naturally want your eyes So we shall shortly have to keep our minds on old Mercia However you need not be disappointed My old friend Sir Nathaniel de Salis who like myself is a free holder near Castra Regis his estate Doom Tower is over the border of Derbyshire on the Peak is coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome Edgar Caswall He is just the sort of man you will like He is devoted to history and is President of the Mercian Archaeological Society He knows more of our own part of the country with its history and its people than anyone else I expect he will have arrived before us and we three can have a long chat after dinner He is also our local geologist and natural historian So you and he will have many interests in common Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak and its caverns and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times They spent the night at Cheltenham and on the following morning resumed their journey to Stafford Adam s eyes were in constant employment and it was not till Salton declared that they had now entered on the last stage of their journey that he referred to Sir Nathaniel s coming As the dusk was closing down they drove on to Lesser Hill Mr Salton s house It was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill not quite so high as that which was covered by the Castle on whose tower flew the flag and which was all ablaze with moving lights manifestly used in the preparations for the festivities on the morrow So Adam deferred his curiosity till daylight His grand uncle was met at the door by a fine old man who greeted him warmly I came over early as you wished I suppose this is your grand nephew I am glad to meet you Mr Adam Salton I am Nathaniel de Salis and your uncle is one of my oldest friends Adam from the moment of their eyes meeting felt as if they were already friends The meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already sounded in his ears The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met made the imparting of information easy Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of the world who had travelled much and within a certain area studied deeply He was a brilliant conversationalist as was to be expected from a successful diplomatist even under unstimulating conditions But he had been touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger man s evident admiration and willingness to learn from him Accordingly the conversation which began on the most friendly basis soon warmed to an interest above proof as the old man spoke of it next day to Richard Salton He knew already that his old friend wanted his grand nephew to learn all he could of the subject in hand and so had during his journey from the Peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation Accordingly Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he wanted to know When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn leaving the three men at their wine Sir Nathaniel began I gather from your uncle by the way I suppose we had better speak of you as uncle and nephew instead of going into exact relationship In fact your uncle is so old and dear a friend that with your permission I shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as Adam as though you were his son I should like answered the young man nothing better The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men but with the usual avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves they instinctively returned to the,bramStoker
desolation of which it was the instrument The road had penetrated the mass of woods that lay nearest to the town and was just emerging into an open space when the traveller s ears were saluted by a sound more mournful than even that of the wind It was like the wailing of some one in distress and it seemed to proceed from beneath a tall and lonely fir tree in the centre of a cleared but unenclosed and uncultivated field The Puritan could not but remember that this was the very spot which had been made accursed a few hours before by the execution of the Quakers whose bodies had been thrown together into one hasty grave beneath the tree on which they suffered He struggled however against the superstitious fears which belonged to the age and compelled himself to pause and listen The voice is most likely mortal nor have I cause to tremble if it be otherwise thought he straining his eyes through the dim moonlight Methinks it is like the wailing of a child some infant it may be which has strayed from its mother and chanced upon this place of death For the ease of mine own conscience I must search this matter out He therefore left the path and walked somewhat fearfully across the field Though now so desolate its soil was pressed down and trampled by the thousand footsteps of those who had witnessed the spectacle of that day all of whom had now retired leaving the dead to their loneliness The traveller at length reached the fir tree which from the middle upward was covered with living branches although a scaffold had been erected beneath and other preparations made for the work of death Under this unhappy tree which in after times was believed to drop poison with its dew sat the one solitary mourner for innocent blood It was a slender and light clad little boy who leaned his face upon a hillock of fresh turned and half frozen earth and wailed bitterly yet in a suppressed tone as if his grief might receive the punishment of crime The Puritan whose approach had been unperceived laid his hand upon the child s shoulder and addressed him compassionately You have chosen a dreary lodging my poor boy and no wonder that you weep said he But dry your eyes and tell me where your mother dwells I promise you if the journey be not too far I will leave you in her arms tonight The boy had hushed his wailing at once and turned his face upward to the stranger It was a pale bright eyed countenance certainly not more than six years old but sorrow fear and want had destroyed much of its infantile expression The Puritan seeing the boy s frightened gaze and feeling that he trembled under his hand endeavored to reassure him Nay if I intended to do you harm little lad the readiest way were to leave you here What you do not fear to sit beneath the gallows on a new made grave and yet you tremble at a friend s touch Take heart child and tell me what is your name and where is your home Friend replied the little boy in a sweet though faltering voice they call me Ilbrahim and my home is here The pale spiritual face the eyes that seemed to mingle with the moonlight the sweet airy voice and the outlandish name almost made the Puritan believe that the boy was in truth a being which had sprung up out of the grave on which he sat but perceiving that the apparition stood the test of a short mental prayer and remembering that the arm which he had touched was lifelike he adopted a more rational supposition The poor child is stricken in his intellect thought he but verily his words are fearful in a place like this He then spoke soothingly intending to humor the boy s fantasy Your home will scarce be comfortable Ilbrahim this cold autumn night and I fear you are ill provided with food I am hastening to a warm supper and bed and if you will go with me you shall share them I thank thee friend but though I be hungry and shivering with cold thou wilt not give me food nor lodging replied the boy in the quiet tone which despair had taught him even so young My father was of the people whom all men hate they have laid him under this heap of earth and here is my home The Puritan who had laid hold of little Ilbrahim s hand relinquished it as if he were touching a loathsome reptile But he possessed a compassionate heart which not even religious prejudice could harden into stone God forbid that I should leave this child to perish though he comes of the accursed sect said he to himself Do we not all spring from an evil root Are we not all in darkness till the light doth shine upon us He shall not perish neither in body nor if prayer and instruction may avail for him in soul He then spoke aloud and kindly to Ilbrahim who had again hid his face in the cold earth of the grave Was every door in the land shut against you my child that you have wandered to this unhallowed spot They drove me forth from the prison when they took my father thence said the boy and I stood afar off watching the crowd of people and when they were gone I came hither and found only this grave I knew that my father was sleeping here and I said This shall be my home No child no not while I have a roof over my head or a morsel to share with you exclaimed the Puritan whose sympathies were now fully excited Rise up and come with me and fear not any harm,nathanielHawthorne

had already given her such instinctive knowledge But at present there was nothing more to be said Mr Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing room To be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable While he talked to Isabella however Emma found an opportunity of saying And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain I am sorry for it The introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better Yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays Even if this family the Braithwaites are put off I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills to keep him to themselves There is jealousy They are jealous even of his regard for his father In short I can feel no dependence on his coming and I wish Mr Weston were less sanguine He ought to come said Emma If he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that A young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one can not comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it One ought to be at Enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied Mrs Weston One ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but Enscombe I believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her But she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite Now according to my idea of Mrs Churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all My dearest Emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way I have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be Emma listened and then coolly said I shall not be satisfied unless he comes He may have a great deal of influence on some points continued Mrs Weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us CHAPTER XV Mr Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared Mr Weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation Mr Elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in Mrs Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa He joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them Emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr Frank Churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making Harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend her fair lovely amiable friend Did she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at Randalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably And in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and Emma was quite in charity with him But at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on Harriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr Perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her She was vexed It did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of Harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper He turned to Mrs Weston to implore her assistance Would not she give him her support would not she add her persuasions to his to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs Goddard s till,janeAusten
better That done we went to see their sleeping rooms on the floor above in which the arrangements were no less excellent and gentle than those we had seen below And after observing that the teachers were of a class and character well suited to the spirit of the place I took leave of the infants with a lighter heart than ever I have taken leave of pauper infants yet Connected with the House of Industry there is also an Hospital which was in the best order and had I am glad to say many beds unoccupied It had one fault however which is common to all American interiors the presence of the eternal accursed suffocating red hot demon of a stove whose breath would blight the purest air under Heaven There are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood One is called the Boylston school and is an asylum for neglected and indigent boys who have committed no crime but who in the ordinary course of things would very soon be purged of that distinction if they were not taken from the hungry streets and sent here The other is a House of Reformation for Juvenile Offenders They are both under the same roof but the two classes of boys never come in contact The Boylston boys as may be readily supposed have very much the advantage of the others in point of personal appearance They were in their school room when I came upon them and answered correctly without book such questions as where was England how far was it what was its population its capital city its form of government and so forth They sang a song too about a farmer sowing his seed with corresponding action at such parts as tis thus he sows he turns him round he claps his hands which gave it greater interest for them and accustomed them to act together in an orderly manner They appeared exceedingly well taught and not better taught than fed for a more chubby looking full waistcoated set of boys I never saw The juvenile offenders had not such pleasant faces by a great deal and in this establishment there were many boys of colour I saw them first at their work basket making and the manufacture of palm leaf hats afterwards in their school where they sang a chorus in praise of Liberty an odd and one would think rather aggravating theme for prisoners These boys are divided into four classes each denoted by a numeral worn on a badge upon the arm On the arrival of a new comer he is put into the fourth or lowest class and left by good behaviour to work his way up into the first The design and object of this Institution is to reclaim the youthful criminal by firm but kind and judicious treatment to make his prison a place of purification and improvement not of demoralisation and corruption to impress upon him that there is but one path and that one sober industry which can ever lead him to happiness to teach him how it may be trodden if his footsteps have never yet been led that way and to lure him back to it if they have strayed in a word to snatch him from destruction and restore him to society a penitent and useful member The importance of such an establishment in every point of view and with reference to every consideration of humanity and social policy requires no comment One other establishment closes the catalogue It is the House of Correction for the State in which silence is strictly maintained but where the prisoners have the comfort and mental relief of seeing each other and of working together This is the improved system of Prison Discipline which we have imported into England and which has been in successful operation among us for some years past America as a new and not over populated country has in all her prisons the one great advantage of being enabled to find useful and profitable work for the inmates whereas with us the prejudice against prison labour is naturally very strong and almost insurmountable when honest men who have not offended against the laws are frequently doomed to seek employment in vain Even in the United States the principle of bringing convict labour and free labour into a competition which must obviously be to the disadvantage of the latter has already found many opponents whose number is not likely to diminish with access of years For this very reason though our best prisons would seem at the first glance to be better conducted than those of America The treadmill is conducted with little or no noise five hundred men may pick oakum in the same room without a sound and both kinds of labour admit of such keen and vigilant superintendence as will render even a word of personal communication amongst the prisoners almost impossible On the other hand the noise of the loom the forge the carpenter s hammer or the stonemason s saw greatly favour those opportunities of intercourse hurried and brief no doubt but opportunities still which these several kinds of work by rendering it necessary for men to be employed very near to each other and often side by side without any barrier or partition between them in their very nature present A visitor too requires to reason and reflect a little before the sight of a number of men engaged in ordinary labour such as he is accustomed to out of doors will impress him half as strongly as the contemplation of the same persons in the same place and garb would if they were occupied in some task marked and degraded everywhere as belonging only to felons in jails In an American state prison or house of correction I found it difficult at first to persuade myself that I was really in a jail a place of ignominious punishment and,charlesDickens
its neighbour so as to toughen the fibre of the whole The fickle Gaul got his steadying from the Franks the steady Saxon got his touch of refinement from the Norman the Italian got a fresh lease of life from the Lombard and the Ostrogoth the corrupt Greek made way for the manly and earnest Mahommedan Everywhere one seems to see a great hand blending the seeds And so one can now save only that emigration has taken the place of war It does not for example take much prophetic power to say that something very great is being built up on the other side of the Atlantic When on an Anglo Celtic basis you see the Italian the Hun and the Scandinavian being added you feel that there is no human quality which may not be thereby evolved But to revert to Gibbon the next stage is the flight of Empire from Rome to Byzantium even as the Anglo Celtic power might find its centre some day not in London but in Chicago or Toronto There is the whole strange story of the tidal wave of Mahommedanism from the south submerging all North Africa spreading right and left to India on the one side and to Spain on the other finally washing right over the walls of Byzantium until it the bulwark of Christianity became what it is now the advanced European fortress of the Moslem Such is the tremendous narrative covering half the world s known history which can all be acquired and made part of yourself by the aid of that humble atlas pencil and note book already recommended When all is so interesting it is hard to pick examples but to me there has always seemed to be something peculiarly impressive in the first entrance of a new race on to the stage of history It has something of the glamour which hangs round the early youth of a great man You remember how the Russians made their debut came down the great rivers and appeared at the Bosphorus in two hundred canoes from which they endeavoured to board the Imperial galleys Singular that a thousand years have passed and that the ambition of the Russians is still to carry out the task at which their skin clad ancestors failed Or the Turks again you may recall the characteristic ferocity with which they opened their career A handful of them were on some mission to the Emperor The town was besieged from the landward side by the barbarians and the Asiatics obtained leave to take part in a skirmish The first Turk galloped out shot a barbarian with his arrow and then lying down beside him proceeded to suck his blood which so horrified the man s comrades that they could not be brought to face such uncanny adversaries So from opposite sides those two great races arrived at the city which was to be the stronghold of the one and the ambition of the other for so many centuries And then even more interesting than the races which arrive are those that disappear There is something there which appeals most powerfully to the imagination Take for example the fate of those Vandals who conquered the north of Africa They were a German tribe blue eyed and flaxen haired from somewhere in the Elbe country Suddenly they too were seized with the strange wandering madness which was epidemic at the time Away they went on the line of least resistance which is always from north to south and from east to west South west was the course of the Vandals a course which must have been continued through pure love of adventure since in the thousands of miles which they traversed there were many fair resting places if that were only their quest They crossed the south of France conquered Spain and finally the more adventurous passed over into Africa where they occupied the old Roman province For two or three generations they held it much as the English hold India and their numbers were at the least some hundreds of thousands Presently the Roman Empire gave one of those flickers which showed that there was still some fire among the ashes Belisarius landed in Africa and reconquered the province The Vandals were cut off from the sea and fled inland Whither did they carry those blue eyes and that flaxen hair Were they exterminated by the negroes or did they amalgamate with them Travellers have brought back stories from the Mountains of the Moon of a Negroid race with light eyes and hair Is it possible that here we have some trace of the vanished Germans It recalls the parallel case of the lost settlements in Greenland That also has always seemed to me to be one of the most romantic questions in history the more so perhaps as I have strained my eyes to see across the ice floes the Greenland coast at the point or near it where the old Eyrbyggia must have stood That was the Scandinavian city founded by colonists from Iceland which grew to be a considerable place so much so that they sent to Denmark for a bishop That would be in the fourteenth century The bishop coming out to his see found that he was unable to reach it on account of a climatic change which had brought down the ice and filled the strait between Iceland and Greenland From that day to this no one has been able to say what has become of these old Scandinavians who were at the time be it remembered the most civilized and advanced race in Europe They may have been overwhelmed by the Esquimaux the despised Skroeling or they may have amalgamated with them or conceivably they might have held their own Very little is known yet of that portion of the coast It would be strange if some Nansen or Peary were to stumble upon the remains of the,arthurDoyle
All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike in severe characters of black and white The jail might have been the infirmary the infirmary might have been the jail the town hall might have been either or both or anything else for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction Fact fact fact everywhere in the material aspect of the town fact fact fact everywhere in the immaterial The M Choakumchild school was all fact and the school of design was all fact and the relations between master and man were all fact and everything was fact between the lying in hospital and the cemetery and what you couldn t state in figures or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest was not and never should be world without end Amen A town so sacred to fact and so triumphant in its assertion of course got on well Why no not quite well No Dear me No Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces in all respects like gold that had stood the fire First the perplexing mystery of the place was Who belonged to the eighteen denominations Because whoever did the labouring people did not It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning and note how few of them the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad called away from their own quarter from their own close rooms from the corners of their own streets where they lounged listlessly gazing at all the church and chapel going as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this because there was a native organization in Coketown itself whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force Then came the Teetotal Society who complained that these same people would get drunk and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk and proved at tea parties that no inducement human or Divine except a medal would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk Then came the chemist and druggist with other tabular statements showing that when they didn t get drunk they took opium Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail with more tabular statements outdoing all the previous tabular statements and showing that the same people would resort to low haunts hidden from the public eye where they heard low singing and saw low dancing and mayhap joined in it and where A B aged twenty four next birthday and committed for eighteen months solitary had himself said not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief his ruin began as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip top moral specimen Then came Mr Gradgrind and Mr Bounderby the two gentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown and both eminently practical who could on occasion furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience and illustrated by cases they had known and seen from which it clearly appeared in short it was the only clear thing in the case that these same people were a bad lot altogether gentlemen that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it gentlemen that they were restless gentlemen that they never knew what they wanted that they lived upon the best and bought fresh butter and insisted on Mocha coffee and rejected all but prime parts of meat and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable In short it was the moral of the old nursery fable There was an old woman and what do you think She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet Is it possible I wonder that there was any analogy between the case of the Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds Surely none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures are to be told at this time of day that one of the foremost elements in the existence of the Coketown working people had been for scores of years deliberately set at nought That there was any Fancy in them demanding to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in convulsions That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and monotonously the craving grew within them for some physical relief some relaxation encouraging good humour and good spirits and giving them a vent some recognized holiday though it were but for an honest dance to a stirring band of music some occasional light pie in which even M Choakumchild had no finger which craving must and would be satisfied aright or must and would inevitably go wrong until the laws of the Creation were repealed This man lives at Pod s End and I don t quite know Pod s End said Mr Gradgrind Which is it Bounderby Mr Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town but knew no more respecting it So they stopped for a moment looking about Almost as they did so there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look a girl whom Mr Gradgrind recognized Halloa said he Stop Where are you going Stop Girl number twenty stopped then palpitating and made him a curtsey Why are you tearing about the streets said Mr Gradgrind in this improper manner I was I was run after sir the girl panted and I wanted to get away Run after repeated Mr Gradgrind Who would run after you The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her by the colourless boy Bitzer who came round the corner with

Sea And far and wide as he might roam he always managed to turn up at frequent intervals at ball and supper and theatre in the gay Hauptstadt of the Habsburgs haunting his favourite caf s and wine vaults skimming through his favourite news sheets greeting old acquaintances and friends from ambassadors down to cobblers in the social scale He seldom talked of his travels but it might be said that his travels talked of him there was an air about him that a German diplomat once summed up in a phrase a man that wolves have sniffed at And then two things happened which he had not mapped out in his route a severe illness shook half the life and all the energy out of him and a heavy money loss brought him almost to the door of destitution With something perhaps of the impulse which drives a stricken animal away from its kind Tom Keriway left the haunts where he had known so much happiness and withdrew into the shelter of a secluded farmhouse lodging more than ever he became to Elaine a hearsay personality And now the chance meeting with the caravan had flung her across the threshold of his retreat What a charming little nook you ve got hold of she exclaimed with instinctive politeness and then looked searchingly round and discovered that she had spoken the truth it really was charming The farmhouse had that intensely English look that one seldom sees out of Normandy Over the whole scene of rickyard garden outbuildings horsepond and orchard brooded that air which seems rightfully to belong to out of the way farmyards an air of wakeful dreaminess which suggests that here man and beast and bird have got up so early that the rest of the world has never caught them up and never will Elaine dismounted and Keriway led the mare round to a little paddock by the side of a great grey barn At the end of the lane they could see the show go past a string of lumbering vans and great striding beasts that seemed to link the vast silences of the desert with the noises and sights and smells the naphtha flares and advertisement hoardings and trampled orange peel of an endless succession of towns You had better let the caravan pass well on its way before you get on the road again said Keriway the smell of the beasts may make your mare nervous and restive going home Then he called to a boy who was busy with a hoe among some defiantly prosperous weeds to fetch the lady a glass of milk and a piece of currant loaf I don t know when I ve seen anything so utterly charming and peaceful said Elaine propping herself on a seat that a pear tree had obligingly designed in the fantastic curve of its trunk Charming certainly said Keriway but too full of the stress of its own little life struggle to be peaceful Since I have lived here I ve learnt what I ve always suspected that a country farmhouse set away in a world of its own is one of the most wonderful studies of interwoven happenings and tragedies that can be imagined It is like the old chronicles of medieval Europe in the days when there was a sort of ordered anarchy between feudal lords and overlords and burg grafs and mitred abbots and prince bishops robber barons and merchant guilds and Electors and so forth all striving and contending and counter plotting and interfering with each other under some vague code of loosely applied rules Here one sees it reproduced under one s eyes like a musty page of black letter come to life Look at one little section of it the poultry life on the farm Villa poultry dull egg machines with records kept of how many ounces of food they eat and how many pennyworths of eggs they lay give you no idea of the wonder life of these farm birds their feuds and jealousies and carefully maintained prerogatives their unsparing tyrannies and persecutions their calculated courage and bravado or sedulously hidden cowardice it might all be some human chapter from the annals of the old Rhineland or medieval Italy And then outside their own bickering wars and hates the grim enemies that come up against them from the woodlands the hawk that dashes among the coops like a moss trooper raiding the border knowing well that a charge of shot may tear him to bits at any moment And the stoat a creeping slip of brown fur a few inches long intently and unstayably out for blood And the hunger taught master of craft the red fox who has waited perhaps half the afternoon for his chance while the fowls were dusting themselves under the hedge and just as they were turning supper ward to the yard one has stopped a moment to give her feathers a final shake and found death springing upon her Do you know he continued as Elaine fed herself and the mare with morsels of currant loaf I don t think any tragedy in literature that I have ever come across impressed me so much as the first one that I spelled out slowly for myself in words of three letters the bad fox has got the red hen There was something so dramatically complete about it the badness of the fox added to all the traditional guile of his race seemed to heighten the horror of the hen s fate and there was such a suggestion of masterful malice about the word got One felt that a countryside in arms would not get that hen away from the bad fox They used to think me a slow dull reader for not getting on with my lesson but I used to sit and picture to myself the red hen with its wings beating helplessly screeching in terrified protest or perhaps,hectorMunro

Carmyle had gone east There was little sympathy between these cousins yet oddly enough their thoughts as they walked centred on the same object Bruce Carmyle threading his way briskly through the crowds of Piccadilly Circus was thinking of Sally and so was Ginger as he loafed aimlessly towards Hyde Park Corner bumping in a sort of coma from pedestrian to pedestrian Since his return to London Ginger had been in bad shape He mooned through the days and slept poorly at night If there is one thing rottener than another in a pretty blighted world one thing which gives a fellow the pip and reduces him to the condition of an absolute onion it is hopeless love Hopeless love had got Ginger all stirred up His had been hitherto a placid soul Even the financial crash which had so altered his life had not bruised him very deeply His temperament had enabled him to bear the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune with a philosophic Right ho But now everything seemed different Things irritated him acutely which before he had accepted as inevitable his Uncle Donald s moustache for instance and its owner s habit of employing it during meals as a sort of zareba or earthwork against the assaults of soup By gad thought Ginger stopping suddenly opposite Devonshire House If he uses that damned shrubbery as soup strainer to night I ll slosh him with a fork Hard thoughts hard thoughts And getting harder all the time for nothing grows more quickly than a mood of rebellion Rebellion is a forest fire that flames across the soul The spark had been lighted in Ginger and long before he reached Hyde Park Corner he was ablaze and crackling By the time he returned to his club he was practically a menace to society to that section of it at any rate which embraced his Uncle Donald his minor uncles George and William and his aunts Mary Geraldine and Louise Nor had the mood passed when he began to dress for the dismal festivities of Bleke s Coffee House He scowled as he struggled morosely with an obstinate tie One can not disguise the fact Ginger was warming up And it was just at this moment that Fate as though it had been waiting for the psychological instant applied the finishing touch There was a knock at the door and a waiter came in with a telegram Ginger looked at the envelope It had been readdressed and forwarded on from the Hotel Normandie It was a wireless handed in on board the White Star liner Olympic and it ran as follows Remember Death to the Family S Ginger sat down heavily on the bed The driver of the taxi cab which at twenty five minutes past seven drew up at the dingy door of Bleke s Coffee House in the Strand was rather struck by his fare s manner and appearance A determined looking sort of young bloke was the taxi driver s verdict CHAPTER V SALLY HEARS NEWS It had been Sally s intention on arriving in New York to take a room at the St Regis and revel in the gilded luxury to which her wealth entitled her before moving into the small but comfortable apartment which as soon as she had the time she intended to find and make her permanent abode But when the moment came and she was giving directions to the taxi driver at the dock there seemed to her something revoltingly Fillmorian about the scheme It would be time enough to sever herself from the boarding house which had been her home for three years when she had found the apartment Meanwhile the decent thing to do if she did not want to brand herself in the sight of her conscience as a female Fillmore was to go back temporarily to Mrs Meecher s admirable establishment and foregather with her old friends After all home is where the heart is even if there are more prunes there than the gourmet would consider judicious Perhaps it was the unavoidable complacency induced by the thought that she was doing the right thing or possibly it was the tingling expectation of meeting Gerald Foster again after all these weeks of separation that made the familiar streets seem wonderfully bright as she drove through them It was a perfect crisp New York morning all blue sky and amber sunshine and even the ash cans had a stimulating look about them The street cars were full of happy people rollicking off to work policemen directed the traffic with jaunty affability and the white clad,pgWodehouse
may be asked Who is this same Agapida who is cited with such deference yet whose name is not to be found in any of the catalogues of Spanish authors The question is hard to answer He appears to have been one of the many indefatigable authors of Spain who have filled the libraries of convents and cathedrals with their tomes without ever dreaming of bringing their labors to the press He evidently was deeply and accurately informed of the particulars of the wars between his countrymen and the Moors a tract of history but too much overgrown with the weeds of fable His glowing zeal also in the cause of the Catholic faith entitles him to be held up as a model of the good old orthodox chroniclers who recorded with such pious exultation the united triumphs of the cross and the sword It is deeply to be regretted therefore that his manuscripts deposited in the libraries of various convents have been dispersed during the late convulsions in Spain so that nothing is now to be met of them but disjointed fragments These however are too precious to be suffered to fall into oblivion as they contain many curious facts not to be found in any other historian In the following work therefore the manuscript of the worthy Fray Antonio will be adopted wherever it exists entire but will be filled up extended illustrated and corroborated by citations from various authors both Spanish and Arabian who have treated of the subject Those who may wish to know how far the work is indebted to the Chronicle of Fray Antonio Agapida may readily satisfy their curiosity by referring to his manuscript fragments carefully preserved in the Library of the Escurial Before entering upon the history it may be as well to notice the opinions of certain of the most learned and devout historiographers of former times relative to this war Marinus Siculus historian to Charles V pronounces it a war to avenge ancient injuries received by the Christians from the Moors to recover the kingdom of Granada and to extend the name and honor of the Christian religion Lucio Marino Siculo Cosas Memorabiles de Espana lib Estevan de Garibay one of the most distinguished Spanish historians regards the war as a special act of divine clemency toward the Moors to the end that those barbarians and infidels who had dragged out so many centuries under the diabolical oppression of the absurd sect of Mahomet should at length be reduced to the Christian faith Garibay Compend Hist Espana lib c Padre Mariana also a venerable Jesuit and the most renowned historian of Spain considers the past domination of the Moors a scourge inflicted on the Spanish nation for its iniquities but the conquest of Granada the reward of Heaven for its great act of propitiation in establishing the glorious tribunal of the Inquisition No sooner says the worthy father was this holy office opened in Spain than there shone forth a resplendent light Then it was that through divine favor the nation increased in power and became competent to overthrow and trample down the Moorish domination Mariana Hist Espana lib c Having thus cited high and venerable authority for considering this war in the light of one of those pious enterprises denominated crusades we trust we have said enough to engage the Christian reader to follow us into the field and stand by us to the very issue of the encounter NOTE TO THE REVISED EDITION The foregoing introduction prefixed to the former editions of this work has been somewhat of a detriment to it Fray Antonio Agapida was found to be an imaginary personage and this threw a doubt over the credibility of his Chronicle which was increased by a vein of irony indulged here and there and by the occasional heightening of some of the incidents and the romantic coloring of some of the scenes A word or two explanatory may therefore be of service Many of the observations in this note have already appeared in an explanatory article which at Mr Murray s request the author furnished to the London Quarterly Review The idea of the work was suggested while I was occupied at Madrid in writing the Life of Columbus In searching for traces of his early life I was led among the scenes of the war of Granada he having followed the Spanish sovereigns in some of their campaigns and been present at the surrender of the Moorish capital I actually wove some of these scenes into the biography but found they occupied an undue space and stood out in romantic relief not in unison with the general course of the narrative My mind however had become so excited by the stirring events and romantic achievements of this war that I could not return with composure to the sober biography I had in hand The idea then occurred as a means of allaying the excitement to throw off a rough draught of the history of this war to be revised and completed at future leisure It appeared to me that its true course and character had never been fully illustrated The world had received a strangely perverted idea of it through Florian s romance of Gonsalvo of Cordova or through the legend equally fabulous entitled The Civil Wars of Granada by Ginez Perez de la Hita the pretended work of an Arabian contemporary but in reality a Spanish fabrication It had been woven over with love tales and scenes of sentimental gallantry totally opposite to its real character for it was in truth one of the sternest of those iron conflicts sanctified by the title of holy wars In fact the genuine nature of the war placed it far above the need of any amatory embellishments It possessed sufficient interest in the striking contrast presented by the combatants of Oriental and European creeds costumes and manners and in the hardy and harebrained enterprises the romantic

to steal softly from the room Fred s door was shut and I could hear him snoring I scratched gently and then harder till I heard the snores stop He got out of bed and opened the door Don t make a noise I whispered Come on downstairs I want you to meet a friend of mine At first he was quite peevish What s the idea he said coming and spoiling a man s beauty sleep Get out He actually started to go back into the room No honestly Fred I said I m not fooling you There is a man downstairs He got in through the window I want you to meet him He s very shy and I think it will do him good to have a chat with you What are you whining about Fred began and then he broke off suddenly and listened We could both hear the man s footsteps as he moved about Fred jumped back into the room He came out carrying something He didn t say any more but started to go downstairs very quiet and I went after him There was the man still putting things in his bag I was just going to introduce Fred when Fred the silly ass gave a great yell I could have bitten him What did you want to do that for you chump I said I told you he was shy Now you ve scared him He certainly had The man was out of the window quicker than you would have believed possible He just flew out I called after him that it was only Fred and me but at that moment a gun went off with a tremendous bang so he couldn t have heard me I was pretty sick about it The whole thing had gone wrong Fred seemed to have lost his head entirely He was behaving like a perfect ass Naturally the man had been frightened with him carrying on in that way I jumped out of the window to see if I could find the man and explain but he was gone Fred jumped out after me and nearly squashed me It was pitch dark out there I couldn t see a thing But I knew the man could not have gone far or I should have heard him I started to sniff round on the chance of picking up his trail It wasn t long before I struck it Fred s father had come down now and they were running about The old man had a light I followed the trail and it ended at a large cedar tree not far from the house I stood underneath it and looked up but of course I could not see anything Are you up there I shouted There s nothing to be scared at It was only Fred He s an old pal of mine He works at the place where you bought me His gun went off by accident He won t hurt you There wasn t a sound I began to think I must have made a mistake He s got away I heard Fred say to his father and just as he said it I caught a faint sound of someone moving in the branches above me No he hasn t I shouted He s up this tree I believe the dog s found him dad Yes he s up here Come along and meet him Fred came to the foot of the tree You up there he said come along down Not a sound from the tree It s all right I explained he is up there but he s very shy Ask him again All right said Fred Stay there if you want to But I m going to shoot off this gun into the branches just for fun And then the man started to come down As soon as he touched the ground I jumped up at him This is fine I said Here s my friend Fred You ll like him But it wasn t any good They didn t get along together at all They hardly spoke The man went into the house and Fred went after him carrying his gun And when they got into the house it was just the same The man sat in one chair and Fred sat in another and after a long time some men came in a motor car and the man went away with them He didn t say good bye to me When he had gone Fred and his father made a great fuss of me I couldn t understand it Men are so odd The man wasn t a bit pleased that I had brought him and Fred together but Fred seemed as if he couldn t do enough for me for having introduced him to the man However Fred s father produced some cold ham my favourite dish and gave me quite a lot of it so I stopped worrying over the thing As mother used to say Don t bother your head about what doesn t concern you The only thing a dog need concern himself with is the bill of fare Eat your bun and don t make yourself busy about other people s affairs Mother s was in some ways a narrow outlook but she had a great fund of sterling common sense II He Moves in Society It was one of those things which are really nobody s fault It was not the chauffeur s fault and it was not mine I was having a friendly turn up with a pal of mine on the side walk he ran across the road I ran after him and the car came round the corner and hit me It must have been going pretty slow or I should have been killed As it was I just had the breath knocked out of me You know how you feel,pgWodehouse
and I said Come on Toby don t keep us waiting and by Gad he drawled out in a most horribly natural voice that he d come when he dashed well pleased I nearly jumped out of my skin Appin had preached to absolutely incredulous hearers Sir Wilfrid s statement carried instant conviction A Babel like chorus of startled exclamation arose amid which the scientist sat mutely enjoying the first fruit of his stupendous discovery In the midst of the clamour Tobermory entered the room and made his way with velvet tread and studied unconcern across to the group seated round the tea table A sudden hush of awkwardness and constraint fell on the company Somehow there seemed an element of embarrassment in addressing on equal terms a domestic cat of acknowledged dental ability Will you have some milk Tobermory asked Lady Blemley in a rather strained voice I don t mind if I do was the response couched in a tone of even indifference A shiver of suppressed excitement went through the listeners and Lady Blemley might be excused for pouring out the saucerful of milk rather unsteadily I m afraid I ve spilt a good deal of it she said apologetically After all it s not my Axminster was Tobermory s rejoinder Another silence fell on the group and then Miss Resker in her best district visitor manner asked if the human language had been difficult to learn Tobermory looked squarely at her for a moment and then fixed his gaze serenely on the middle distance It was obvious that boring questions lay outside his scheme of life What do you think of human intelligence asked Mavis Pellington lamely Of whose intelligence in particular asked Tobermory coldly Oh well mine for instance said Mavis with a feeble laugh You put me in an embarrassing position said Tobermory whose tone and attitude certainly did not suggest a shred of embarrassment When your inclusion in this house party was suggested Sir Wilfrid protested that you were the most brainless woman of his acquaintance and that there was a wide distinction between hospitality and the care of the feeble minded Lady Blemley replied that your lack of brain power was the precise quality which had earned you your invitation as you were the only person she could think of who might be idiotic enough to buy their old car You know the one they call The Envy of Sisyphus because it goes quite nicely up hill if you push it Lady Blemley s protestations would have had greater effect if she had not casually suggested to Mavis only that morning that the car in question would be just the thing for her down at her Devonshire home Major Barfield plunged in heavily to effect a diversion How about your carryings on with the tortoiseshell puss up at the stables eh The moment he had said it every one realized the blunder One does not usually discuss these matters in public said Tobermory frigidly From a slight observation of your ways since you ve been in this house I should imagine you d find it inconvenient if I were to shift the conversation on to your own little affairs The panic which ensued was not confined to the Major Would you like to go and see if cook has got your dinner ready suggested Lady Blemley hurriedly affecting to ignore the fact that it wanted at least two hours to Tobermory s dinner time Thanks said Tobermory not quite so soon after my tea I don t want to die of indigestion Cats have nine lives you know said Sir Wilfrid heartily Possibly answered Tobermory but only one liver Adelaide said Mrs Cornett do you mean to encourage that cat to go out and gossip about us in the servants hall The panic had indeed become general A narrow ornamental balustrade ran in front of most of the bedroom windows at the Towers and it was recalled with dismay that this had formed a favourite promenade for Tobermory at all hours whence he could watch the pigeons and heaven knew what else besides If he intended to become reminiscent in his present outspoken strain the effect would be something more than disconcerting Mrs Cornett who spent much time at her toilet table and whose complexion was reputed to be of a nomadic though punctual disposition looked as ill at ease as the Major Miss Scrawen who wrote fiercely sensuous poetry and led a blameless life merely displayed irritation if you are methodical and virtuous in private you don t necessarily want every one to know it Bertie van Tahn who was so depraved at seventeen that he had long ago given up trying to be any worse turned a dull shade of gardenia white but he did not commit the error of dashing out of the room like Odo Finsberry a young gentleman who was understood to be reading for the Church and who was possibly disturbed at the thought of scandals he might hear concerning other people Clovis had the presence of mind to maintain a composed exterior privately he was calculating how long it would take to procure a box of fancy mice through the agency of the EXCHANGE AND MART as a species of hush money Even in a delicate situation like the present Agnes Resker could not endure to remain too long in the background Why did I ever come down here she asked dramatically Tobermory immediately accepted the opening Judging by what you said to Mrs Cornett on the croquet lawn yesterday you were out for food You described the Blemleys as the dullest people to stay with that you knew but said they were clever enough to employ a first rate cook otherwise they d find it difficult to get anyone to come down a second time There s not a word of truth in it I appeal to Mrs Cornett exclaimed the discomfited Agnes

we up to the lake and all around I ve got enough money to buy a gun and if there s any hunting around there we ll hunt Kate down in my heart I m sick of massaging old ladies double chins and kidding them into thinking they look young And anyway she added straightforwardly I don t suppose I ll be at the Martha much longer They re going to let a lot of us girls out and I m almost sure to be one of them There s enough of the older girls to do all the work there is now till the tourist season begins again in the fall I couldn t get in anywhere else this time of the year so I d just about have to go out to one of the beaches and get a little tent house or something with some of the girls and fool around until something opened up in the fall And even if you live in your bathing suit all day Kate you just can t get by without spending a little money Well of course you d stay with me if I were here I wouldn t hear to anything else And even why don t you come on out anyway till we get ready to start We could plan so much better And don t you think Marion it would be much better for you if you didn t wait for the Martha to let you go but gave them notice instead Quit before I m invited to leave I believe I d better do that Kate It won t be half bad to spring it on the girls that I m going up in the mountains for the summer I ll talk about that lake till say I m just wild to start How soon do you think it will be Fred will have to teach me how to trout fish or whatever you call it Only think of stepping out of our log cabin and catching trout just any time you want to And Kate I really am going to buy a gun Down on Spring in that sporting goods house you know the one on the corner they have got the cutest rifles And by the way they had some of the best looking outing suits in the window the other day I m going in there when I come down in the morning Let Fred advise you about the rifle before you buy Fred s tremendously clever about nature stuff Marion He ll know just what you want I think a gun will maybe be necessary You know there are bear Oh good night cried Marion But in the next breath she added I wonder if there are any nice hunters after the bears CHAPTER SEVEN GUARDIAN OF THE FORESTS In mid July the pines and spruces and firs have lost their pale green fingertips which they wave to the world in spring and have settled down to the placid business of growing new cones that shall bear the seed of future forests as stately as these On the shadowed needle carpeted slopes there is always a whispery kind of calm the calm of Nature moving quietly about her appointed tasks without haste and without uncertainty untorn by doubts or fears or futile questioning like a broad souled deep bosomed mother contentedly rearing her young in a sheltered home where love abides in the peace which passeth understanding Gray squirrels sleek and bright eyed and graceful always lope over the brown needles intent upon some urgent business of their own Noisy little chipmunks sit up and nibble nervously at dainties they have found and flirt their tails and gossip and scold the carping bluejays that peer down from overhanging branches Perhaps a hoot owl in the hollow trees overhead opens amber eyes and blinks irritatedly at the chattering then wriggles his head farther down into his feathers stretches a leg and a wing and settles himself for another nap Little streams go sliding down between banks of bright green grass and fuss over the mossy rocks that lie in their beds Deer lift heads often to listen and look and sniff the breeze between mouthfuls of the tender twigs they love Shambling slack jointed bears move shuffling through the thickets like the deer lifting suspicious noses to test frequently the wind lest some enemy steal upon them unaware From his glass walled eyrie Jack Corey gazed down upon the wooded slopes and dreamed of what they hid of beauty and menace and calm and of loneliness He saw them once drenched with rain but mostly they lay warm under the hot sunshine of summer He saw them darkling with night shadows he saw them silvered with morning fogs which turned rose tinted with the first rays of sunrise he saw them lie soft shaded in the sunset s after glow saw them held in the unearthly beauty of the full moonlight Like the deer and the bear down there his head was lifted often to look and to sniff the wind that blew strongly over the peak For now the winds came too often tainted with the smoke of burning pines The blue haze of the far distance deepened with the thickening air Four times in the last ten days he had swung the pointer over the mapped table and sighted it upon brown puffballs that rose over the treetops the first betraying marks of the licking flames below He had watched the puff balls grow until they exploded into rolling clouds of smoke yellow where the flames mounted high in some dead pine or into a cedar black where a pitch stump took fire After he had telephoned the alarm to headquarters he would watch anxiously the spreading pall To stand up there helpless while great trees that had been a hundred years or more in the growing died the death of,bmBower

not A girl not out has always the same sort of dress a close bonnet for instance looks very demure and never says a word You may smile but it is so I assure you and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far it is all very proper Girls should be quiet and modest The most objectionable part is that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite to confidence That is the faulty part of the present system One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before Mr Bertram I dare say you have sometimes met with such changes I believe I have but this is hardly fair I see what you are at You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson No indeed Miss Anderson I do not know who or what you mean I am quite in the dark But I will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about Ah you carry it off very well but I can not be quite so far imposed on You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye in describing an altered young lady You paint too accurately for mistake It was exactly so The Andersons of Baker Street We were speaking of them the other day you know Edmund you have heard me mention Charles Anderson The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it When Anderson first introduced me to his family about two years ago his sister was not out and I could not get her to speak to me I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson with only her and a little girl or two in the room the governess being sick or run away and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady nothing like a civil answer she screwed up her mouth and turned from me with such an air I did not see her again for a twelvemonth She was then out I met her at Mrs Holford s and did not recollect her She came up to me claimed me as an acquaintance stared me out of countenance and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time and Miss Crawford it is plain has heard the story And a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it I dare say than does credit to Miss Anderson It is too common a fault Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters I do not know where the error lies I do not pretend to set people right but I do see that they are often wrong Those who are showing the world what female manners should be said Mr Bertram gallantly are doing a great deal to set them right The error is plain enough said the less courteous Edmund such girls are ill brought up They are given wrong notions from the beginning They are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards I do not know replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly Yes I can not agree with you there It is certainly the modestest part of the business It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which I have seen done That is worse than anything quite disgusting Yes that is very inconvenient indeed said Mr Bertram It leads one astray one does not know what to do The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September just after my return from the West Indies My friend Sneyd you have heard me speak of Sneyd Edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me When we reached Albion Place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier Mrs and the two Miss Sneyds with others of their acquaintance I made my bow in form and as Mrs Sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as I could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong They looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and Miss Sneyd I believe has never forgiven me That was bad indeed Poor Miss Sneyd Though I have no younger sister I feel for her To be neglected before one s time must be very vexatious but it was entirely the mother s fault Miss Augusta should have been with her governess Such half and half doings never prosper But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price Does she go to balls Does she dine out every where as well as at my sister s No replied Edmund I do not think she has ever been,janeAusten
were immediately washed overboard We also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves On this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator Toward evening we saw several sharks and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us At one time a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water the monster actually swam in upon us floundering for some moments just over the companion hatch and striking Peters violently with his tail A heavy sea at length hurled him overboard much to our relief In moderate weather we might have easily captured him July This morning the wind having greatly abated and the sea not being very rough we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom After a great deal of hard labor during the whole day we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter the partitions of the room having been stove during the night and its contents swept into the hold This discovery as may be supposed filled us with despair July The sea nearly smooth with a light wind and still from the northward and westward The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes Found great relief from thirst and much comfort otherwise by bathing in the sea in this however we were forced to use great caution being afraid of sharks several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day July Good weather still The brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency lashing our tortoise waterjug and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward placing them outside the hull below the main chains The sea very smooth all day with little or no wind July A continuance of the same weather Augustus s wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification He complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst but no acute pain Nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced We did every thing in our power for his comfort and trebled his allowance of water July An excessively hot day with no wind An enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon We made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose Augustus much worse and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds He constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings wishing for nothing but death This evening we ate the last of our olives and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine Determined to kill our tortoise in the morning July After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue owing to the position of the hulk we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed although in good condition the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible we cut it into fine pieces and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the wine bottle all of which had been kept pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives In this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day the whole would thus last us thirteen days A brisk shower with severe thunder and lightning came on about dusk but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water The whole of this by common consent was given to Augustus who now appeared to be in the last extremity He drank the water from the sheet as we caught it we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth for we had now nothing left capable of holding water unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy or the stale water from the jug Either of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught His arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder and his feet were like ice We expected every moment to see him breathe his last He was frightfully emaciated so much so that although he weighed a hundred and twenty seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket he now did not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest His eyes were sunk far in his head being scarcely perceptible and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food or even swallowing any liquid without great difficulty August A continuance of the same calm weather with an oppressively hot sun Suffered exceedingly from thirst the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin We contrived nevertheless to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine our thirst however was but little abated We found more relief by bathing in the sea but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals on account of the continual presence of sharks We now saw The Works of Edgar Allan Poe by Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Edition VOLUME III Contents NARRATIVE OF A GORDON

CHAPTER NOTES TO THE THIRD VOLUME LIGEIA MORELLA A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS THE SPECTACLES KING PEST THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK NARRATIVE OF A GORDON PYM INTRODUCTORY NOTE Upon my return to the United States a few months ago after the extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere of which an account is given in the following pages accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in Richmond Va who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions I had visited and who were constantly urging it upon me as a duty to give my narrative to the public I had several reasons however for declining to do so some of which were of a nature altogether private and concern no person but myself others not so much so One consideration which deterred me was that having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which I was absent I feared I should not be able to write from mere memory a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are,allanPoe
for the nobility that tyrannical murderous rapacious and morally rotten as they were they were deeply and enthusiastically religious Nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the Church More than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage stop to pray before cutting his throat more than once I had seen a noble after ambushing and despatching his enemy retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks without even waiting to rob the body There was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even Benvenuto Cellini that rough hewn saint ten centuries later All the nobles of Britain with their families attended divine service morning and night daily in their private chapels and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides The credit of this belonged entirely to the Church Although I was no friend to that Catholic Church I was obliged to admit this And often in spite of me I found myself saying What would this country be without the Church After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by hundreds of grease jets and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts At the head of the hall on a dais was the table of the king queen and their son Prince Uwaine Stretching down the hall from this was the general table on the floor At this above the salt sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families of both sexes the resident Court in effect sixty one persons below the salt sat minor officers of the household with their principal subordinates altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs or serving in one capacity or another It was a very fine show In a gallery a band with cymbals horns harps and other horrors opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude first draft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as In the Sweet Bye and Bye It was new and ought to have been rehearsed a little more For some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged after dinner After this music the priest who stood behind the royal table said a noble long grace in ostensible Latin Then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts and darted rushed flew fetched and carried and the mighty feeding began no words anywhere but absorbing attention to business The rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery The havoc continued an hour and a half and unimaginable was the destruction of substantials Of the chief feature of the feast the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop skirt and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes With the pastries and so on the heavy drinking began and the talk Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared and everybody got comfortable then happy then sparklingly joyous both sexes and by and by pretty noisy Men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear but nobody blushed and when the nub was sprung the assemblage let go with a horse laugh that shook the fortress Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England hide behind a handkerchief but nobody hid here but only laughed howled you may say In pretty much all of these dreadful stories ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes but that didn t worry the chaplain any he had his laugh with the rest more than that upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was sung that night By midnight everybody was fagged out and sore with laughing and as a rule drunk some weepingly some affectionately some hilariously some quarrelsomely some dead and under the table Of the ladies the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess whose wedding eve this was and indeed she was a spectacle sure enough Just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the Regent d Orleans at the famous dinner whence she was carried foul mouthed intoxicated and helpless to her bed in the lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime Suddenly even while the priest was lifting his hands and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing there appeared under the arch of the far off door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white haired lady leaning upon a crutch stick and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the queen and cried out The wrath and curse of God fall upon you woman without pity who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright for a curse was an awful thing to those people but the queen rose up majestic with the death light in her eye and flung back this ruthless command Lay hands on her To the stake with her The guards left their posts to obey It was a shame it was a cruel thing to see What could be done Sandy gave me a look I knew she had another inspiration I said Do what you choose She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment She indicated me and said Madame he saith this may not,markTwain
man and afterwards to the lower animals Some of the instances are of a very trifling nature but they are as good for our purpose as more important habits It is known to everyone how difficult or even impossible it is without repeated trials to move the limbs in certain opposed directions which have never been practised Analogous cases occur with sensations as in the common experiment of rolling a marble beneath the tips of two crossed fingers when it feels exactly like two marbles Everyone protects himself when falling to the ground by extending his arms and as Professor Alison has remarked few can resist acting thus when voluntarily falling on a soft bed A man when going out of doors puts on his gloves quite unconsciously and this may seem an extremely simple operation but he who has taught a child to put on gloves knows that this is by no means the case When our minds are much affected so are the movements of our bodies but here another principle besides habit namely the undirected overflow of nerve force partially comes into play Norfolk in speaking of Cardinal Wolsey says Some strange commotion Is in his brain he bites his lip and starts Stops on a sudden looks upon the ground Then lays his finger on his temple straight Springs out into fast gait then stops again Strikes his breast hard and anon he casts His eye against the moon in most strange postures We have seen him set himself Hen VIII act iii sc A vulgar man often scratches his head when perplexed in mind and I believe that he acts thus from habit as if he experienced a slightly uncomfortable bodily sensation namely the itching of his head to which he is particularly liable and which he thus relieves Another man rubs his eyes when perplexed or gives a little cough when embarrassed acting in either case as if he felt a slightly uncomfortable sensation in his eyes or windpipe From the continued use of the eyes these organs are especially liable to be acted on through association under various states of the mind although there is manifestly nothing to be seen A man as Gratiolet remarks who vehemently rejects a proposition will almost certainly shut his eyes or turn away his face but if he accepts the proposition he will nod his head in affirmation and open his eyes widely The man acts in this latter case as if he clearly saw the thing and in the former case as if he did not or would not see it I have noticed that persons in describing a horrid sight often shut their eyes momentarily and firmly or shake their heads as if not to see or to drive away something disagreeable and I have caught myself when thinking in the dark of a horrid spectacle closing my eyes firmly In looking suddenly at any object or in looking all around everyone raises his eyebrows so that the eyes may be quickly and widely opened and Duchenne remarks that a person in trying to remember something often raises his eyebrows as if to see it A Hindoo gentleman made exactly the same remark to Mr Erskine in regard to his countrymen I noticed a young lady earnestly trying to recollect a painter s name and she first looked to one corner of the ceiling and then to the opposite corner arching the one eyebrow on that side although of course there was nothing to be seen there In most of the foregoing cases we can understand how the associated movements were acquired through habit but with some individuals certain strange gestures or tricks have arisen in association with certain states of the mind owing to wholly inexplicable causes and are undoubtedly inherited I have elsewhere given one instance from my own observation of an extraordinary and complex gesture associated with pleasurable feelings which was transmitted from a father to his daughter as well as some other analogous facts Another curious instance of an odd inherited movement associated with the wish to obtain an object will be given in the course of this volume There are other actions which are commonly performed under certain circumstances independently of habit and which seem to be due to imitation or some sort of sympathy Thus persons cutting anything with a pair of scissors may be seen to move their jaws simultaneously with the blades of the scissors Children learning to write often twist about their tongues as their fingers move in a ridiculous fashion When a public singer suddenly becomes a little hoarse many of those present may be heard as I have been assured by a gentleman on whom I can rely to clear their throats but here habit probably comes into play as we clear our own throats under similar circumstances I have also been told that at leaping matches as the performer makes his spring many of the spectators generally men and boys move their feet but here again habit probably comes into play for it is very doubtful whether women would thus act Reflex actions Reflex actions in the strict sense of the term are due to the excitement of a peripheral nerve which transmits its influence to certain nerve cells and these in their turn excite certain muscles or glands into action and all this may take place without any sensation or consciousness on our part though often thus accompanied As many reflex actions are highly expressive the subject must here be noticed at some little length We shall also see that some of them graduate into and can hardly be distinguished from actions which have arisen through habit Coughing and sneezing are familiar instances of reflex actions With infants the first act of respiration is often a sneeze although this requires the co ordinated movement of numerous muscles Respiration is partly voluntary but mainly reflex and is performed in the most natural and,charlesDarwin
I thought to myself this now is as it should be It is good to shake off now and then this iron yoke round our necks And after having once permitted us sailors to be a little noisy in a harmless way somewhat merrily turbulent the officers can not with any good grace be so excessively stern and unyielding as before I began to think a man of war a man of peace and good will after all But alas disappointment came Next morning the same old scene was enacted at the gang way And beholding the row of uncompromising looking officers there assembled with the Captain to witness punishment the same officers who had been so cheerfully disposed over night an old sailor touched my shoulder and said See White Jacket all round they have shipped their quarter deck faces again But this is the way I afterward learned that this was an old man of war s man s phrase expressive of the facility with which a sea officer falls back upon all the severity of his dignity after a temporary suspension of it CHAPTER XXIV INTRODUCTORY TO CAPE HORN And now through drizzling fogs and vapours and under damp double reefed top sails our wet decked frigate drew nearer and nearer to the squally Cape Who has not heard of it Cape Horn Cape Horn a horn indeed that has tossed many a good ship Was the descent of Orpheus Ulysses or Dante into Hell one whit more hardy and sublime than the first navigator s weathering of that terrible Cape Turned on her heel by a fierce West Wind many an outward bound ship has been driven across the Southern Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope that way to seek a passage to the Pacific And that stormy Cape I doubt not has sent many a fine craft to the bottom and told no tales At those ends of the earth are no chronicles What signify the broken spars and shrouds that day after day are driven before the prows of more fortunate vessels or the tall masts imbedded in icebergs that are found floating by They but hint the old story of ships that have sailed from their ports and never more have been heard of Impracticable Cape You may approach it from this direction or that in any way you please from the East or from the West with the wind astern or abeam or on the quarter and still Cape Horn is Cape Horn Cape Horn it is that takes the conceit out of fresh water sailors and steeps in a still salter brine the saltest Woe betide the tyro the fool hardy Heaven preserve Your Mediterranean captain who with a cargo of oranges has hitherto made merry runs across the Atlantic without so much as furling a t gallant sail oftentimes off Cape Horn receives a lesson which he carries to the grave though the grave as is too often the case follows so hard on the lesson that no benefit comes from the experience Other strangers who draw nigh to this Patagonia termination of our Continent with their souls full of its shipwrecks and disasters top sails cautiously reefed and everything guardedly snug these strangers at first unexpectedly encountering a tolerably smooth sea rashly conclude that the Cape after all is but a bugbear they have been imposed upon by fables and founderings and sinkings hereabouts are all cock and bull stories Out reefs my hearties fore and aft set t gallant sails stand by to give her the fore top mast stun sail But Captain Rash those sails of yours were much safer in the sail maker s loft For now while the heedless craft is bounding over the billows a black cloud rises out of the sea the sun drops down from the sky a horrible mist far and wide spreads over the water Hands by the halyards Let go Clew up Too late For ere the ropes ends can be the east off from the pins the tornado is blowing down to the bottom of their throats The masts are willows the sails ribbons the cordage wool the whole ship is brewed into the yeast of the gale An now if when the first green sea breaks over him Captain Rash is not swept overboard he has his hands full be sure In all probability his three masts have gone by the board and ravelled into list his sails are floating in the air Or perhaps the ship broaches to or is brought by the lee In either ease Heaven help the sailors their wives and their little ones and heaven help the underwriters Familiarity with danger makes a brave man braver but less daring Thus with seamen he who goes the oftenest round Cape Horn goes the most circumspectly A veteran mariner is never deceived by the treacherous breezes which sometimes waft him pleasantly toward the latitude of the Cape No sooner does he come within a certain distance of it previously fixed in his own mind than all hands are turned to setting the ship in storm trim and never mind how light the breeze down come his t gallant yards He bends his strongest storm sails and lashes every thing on deck securely The ship is then ready for the worst and if in reeling round the headland she receives a broadside it generally goes well with her If ill all hands go to the bottom with quiet consciences Among sea captains there are some who seem to regard the genius of the Cape as a wilful capricious jade that must be courted and coaxed into complaisance First they come along under easy sails do not steer boldly for the headland but tack this way and that sidling up to it Now they woo the Jezebel with a t gallant studding sail anon they deprecate her wrath with double reefed topsails When at length,hermanMelville
don t know that country But that north country we know as landmarks anyway Look at that saw tooth range The Indians call it Echo Cliffs At the far end it drops off into the Colorado River Lee s Ferry is there about one hundred and sixty miles That ragged black rent is the Grand Canyon Looks like a thread doesn t it But Carley it s some hole believe me Away to the left you see the tremendous wall rising and turning to come this way That s the north wall of the Canyon It ends at the great bluff Greenland Point See the black fringe above the bar of gold That s a belt of pine trees It s about eighty miles across this ragged old stone washboard of a desert Now turn and look straight and strain your sight over Wildcat See the rim purple dome You must look hard I m glad it s clear and the sun is shining We don t often get this view That purple dome is Navajo Mountain two hundred miles and more away Carley yielded to some strange drawing power and slowly walked forward until she stood at the extreme edge of the summit What was it that confounded her sight Desert slope down and down color distance space The wind that blew in her face seemed to have the openness of the whole world back of it Cold sweet dry exhilarating it breathed of untainted vastness Carley s memory pictures of the Adirondacks faded into pastorals her vaunted images of European scenery changed to operetta settings She had nothing with which to compare this illimitable space Oh America was her unconscious tribute Stanton and Flo had come on to places beside her The young man laughed Wal now Miss Carley you couldn t say more When I was in camp trainin for service overseas I used to remember how this looked An it seemed one of the things I was goin to fight for Reckon I didn t the idea of the Germans havin my Painted Desert I didn t get across to fight for it but I shore was willin You see Carley this is our America said Flo softly Carley had never understood the meaning of the word The immensity of the West seemed flung at her What her vision beheld so far reaching and boundless was only a dot on the map Does any one live out there she asked with slow sweep of hand A few white traders and some Indian tribes replied Stanton But you can ride all day an next day an never see a livin soul What was the meaning of the gratification in his voice Did Westerners court loneliness Carley wrenched her gaze from the desert void to look at her companions Stanton s eyes were narrowed his expression had changed lean and hard and still his face resembled bronze The careless humor was gone as was the heated flush of his quarrel with Flo The girl too had subtly changed had responded to an influence that had subdued and softened her She was mute her eyes held a light comprehensive and all embracing she was beautiful then For Carley quick to read emotion caught a glimpse of a strong steadfast soul that spiritualized the brown freckled face Carley wheeled to gaze out and down into this incomprehensible abyss and on to the far up flung heights white and red and yellow and so on to the wonderful mystic haze of distance The significance of Flo s designation of miles could not be grasped by Carley She could not estimate distance But she did not need that to realize her perceptions were swallowed up by magnitude Hitherto the power of her eyes had been unknown How splendid to see afar She could see yes but what did she see Space first annihilating space dwarfing her preconceived images and then wondrous colors What had she known of color No wonder artists failed adequately and truly to paint mountains let alone the desert space The toiling millions of the crowded cities were ignorant of this terrible beauty and sublimity Would it have helped them to see But just to breathe that untainted air just to see once the boundless open of colored sand and rock to realize what the freedom of eagles meant would not that have helped anyone And with the thought there came to Carley s quickened and struggling mind a conception of freedom She had not yet watched eagles but she now gazed out into their domain What then must be the effect of such environment on people whom it encompassed The idea stunned Carley Would such people grow in proportion to the nature with which they were in conflict Hereditary influence could not be comparable to such environment in the shaping of character Shore I could stand here all day said Flo But it s beginning to cloud over and this high wind is cold So we d better go Carley I don t know what I am but it s not cold replied Carley Wal Miss Carley I reckon you ll have to come again an again before you get a comfortable feelin here said Stanton It surprised Carley to see that this young Westerner had hit upon the truth He understood her Indeed she was uncomfortable She was oppressed vaguely unhappy But why The thing there the infinitude of open sand and rock was beautiful wonderful even glorious She looked again Steep black cindered slope with its soft gray patches of grass sheered down and down and out in rolling slope to merge upon a cedar dotted level Nothing moved below but a red tailed hawk sailed across her vision How still how gray the desert floor as it reached away losing its black dots and gaining bronze spots of stone By plain and prairie it fell away each inch of gray in her sight magnifying

and won t do neither There s the British Empire beyond the seas Canada Australia New Zealand East Africa He rolled the names round his tongue with obvious relish If it was a list of first class battleships and armoured cruisers and destroyers and airships that you were reeling off there would be some comfort and hope in the situation said Yeovil the loyalty of the colonies is a splendid thing but it is only pathetically splendid because it can do so little to recover for us what we ve lost Against the Zeppelin air fleet and the Dreadnought sea squadrons and the new Gelberhaus cruisers the last word in maritime mobility of what avail is loyal devotion plus half a dozen warships one keel to ten scattered over one or two ocean coasts Ah but they ll build said the fisherman confidently they ll build They re only waiting to enlarge their dockyard accommodation and get the right class of artificers and engineers and workmen together The money will be forthcoming somehow and they ll start in and build And do you suppose asked Yeovil in slow bitter contempt that the victorious nation is going to sit and watch and wait till the defeated foe has created a new war fleet big enough to drive it from the seas Do you suppose it is going to watch keel added to keel gun to gun airship to airship till its preponderance has been wiped out or even threatened That sort of thing is done once in a generation not twice Who is going to protect Australia or New Zealand while they enlarge their dockyards and hangars and build their dreadnoughts and their airships Here s my station and I m not sorry said the fisherman gathering his tackle together and rising to depart I ve listened to you long enough You and me wouldn t agree not if we was to talk all day Fact is I m an out and out patriot and you re only a half hearted one That s what you are half hearted And with that parting shot he left the carriage and lounged heavily down the platform a patriot who had never handled a rifle or mounted a horse or pulled an oar but who had never flinched from demolishing his country s enemies with his tongue England has never had any lack of patriots of that type thought Yeovil sadly so many patriots and so little patriotism CHAPTER XIII TORYWOOD Yeovil got out of the train at a small clean wayside station and rapidly formed the conclusion that neatness abundant leisure and a devotion to the cultivation of wallflowers and wyandottes were the prevailing influences of the station master s life The train slid away into the hazy distance of trees and meadows and left the traveller standing in a world that seemed to be made up in equal parts of rock garden chicken coops and whiskey advertisements The station master who appeared also to act as emergency porter took Yeovil s ticket with the gesture of a kind hearted person brushing away a troublesome wasp and returned to a study of the Poultry Chronicle which was giving its readers sage counsel concerning the ailments of belated July chickens Yeovil called to mind the station master of a tiny railway town in Siberia who had held him in long and rather intelligent converse on the poetical merits and demerits of Shelley and he wondered what the result would be if he were to engage the English official in a discussion on Lermontoff or for the matter of that on Shelley The temptation to experiment was however removed by the arrival of a young groom with brown eyes and a friendly smile who hurried into the station and took Yeovil once more into a world where he was of fleeting importance In the roadway outside was a four wheeled dogcart with a pair of the famous Torywood blue roans It was an agreeable variation in modern locomotion to be met at a station with high class horseflesh instead of the ubiquitous motor and the landscape was not of such a nature that one wished to be whirled through it in a cloud of dust After a quick spin of some ten or fifteen minutes through twisting hedge girt country roads the roans turned in at a wide gateway and went with dancing rhythmic step along the park drive The screen of oak crowned upland suddenly fell away and a grey sharp cornered building came into view in a setting of low growing beeches and dark pines Torywood was not a stately reposeful looking house it lay amid the sleepy landscape like a couched watchdog with pricked ears and wakeful eyes Built somewhere about the last years of Dutch William s reign it had been a centre ever since for the political life of the countryside a storm centre of discontent or a rallying ground for the well affected as the circumstances of the day might entail On the stone flagged terrace in front of the house with its quaint leaden figures of Diana pursuing a hound pressed stag successive squires and lords of Torywood had walked to and fro with their friends watching the thunderclouds on the political horizon or the shifting shadows on the sundial of political favour tapping the political barometer for indications of change working out a party campaign or arranging for the support of some national movement To and fro they had gone in their respective generations men with the passion for statecraft and political combat strong in their veins and many oft recurring names had echoed under those wakeful looking casements names spoken in anger or exultation or murmured in fear and anxiety Bolingbroke Charles Edward Walpole the Farmer King Bonaparte Pitt Wellington Peel Gladstone echo and Time might have graven those names on the stone flags and grey walls And now one tired old woman walked there with,hectorMunro
other nor why you should think it worth talking about the young man reasoned Neither can I It s just a whim Certainly if it will give you any pleasure I ll say nothing at the shop That s charming of you and I m very grateful I see now that this was why the spirit moved me to come up to save them Mrs Ryves went on She added moving away that now she had saved them she must really go To save them for what if I mayn t break the seals Baron asked I don t know for a generous sacrifice Why should it be generous What s at stake Peter demanded leaning against the doorpost as she stood on the landing I don t know what but I feel as if something or other were in peril Burn them up she exclaimed with shining eyes Ah you ask too much I m so curious about them Well I won t ask more than I ought and I m much obliged to you for your promise to be quiet I trust to your discretion Good by You ought to reward my discretion said Baron coming out to the landing She had partly descended the staircase and she stopped leaning against the baluster and smiling up at him Surely you ve had your reward in the honour of my visit That s delightful as far as it goes But what will you do for me if I burn the papers Mrs Ryves considered a moment Burn them first and you ll see On this she went rapidly downstairs and Baron to whom the answer appeared inadequate and the proposition indeed in that form grossly unfair returned to his room The vivacity of her interest in a question in which she had discoverably nothing at stake mystified amused and in addition irresistibly charmed him She was delicate imaginative inflammable quick to feel quick to act He didn t complain of it it was the way he liked women to be but he was not impelled for the hour to commit the sealed packets to the flames He dropped them again into their secret well and after that he went out He felt restless and excited another day was lost for work the dreadful job to be performed for Mr Locket was still further off III TEN days after Mrs Ryves s visit he paid by appointment another call on the editor of the Promiscuous He found him in the little wainscoted Chelsea house which had to Peter s sense the smoky brownness of an old pipebowl surrounded with all the emblems of his office a litter of papers a hedge of encyclop dias a photographic gallery of popular contributors and he promised at first to consume very few of the moments for which so many claims competed It was Mr Locket himself however who presently made the interview spacious gave it air after discovering that poor Baron had come to tell him something more interesting than that he couldn t after all patch up his tale Peter had begun with this had intimated respectfully that it was a case in which both practice and principle rebelled and then perceiving how little Mr Locket was affected by his audacity had felt weak and slightly silly left with his heroism on his hands He had armed himself for a struggle but the Promiscuous didn t even protest and there would have been nothing for him but to go away with the prospect of never coming again had he not chanced to say abruptly irrelevantly as he got up from his chair Do you happen to be at all interested in Sir Dominick Ferrand Mr Locket who had also got up looked over his glasses The late Sir Dominick The only one you know the family s extinct Mr Locket shot his young friend another sharp glance a silent retort to the glibness of this information Very extinct indeed I m afraid the subject today would scarcely be regarded as attractive Are you very sure Baron asked Mr Locket leaned forward a little with his fingertips on his table in the attitude of giving permission to retire I might consider the question in a special connection He was silent a minute in a way that relegated poor Peter to the general but meeting the young man s eyes again he asked Are you a thinking of proposing an article upon him Not exactly proposing it because I don t yet quite see my way but the idea rather appeals to me Mr Locket emitted the safe assertion that this eminent statesman had been a striking figure in his day then he added Have you been studying him I ve been dipping into him I m afraid he s scarcely a question of the hour said Mr Locket shuffling papers together I think I could make him one Peter Baron declared Mr Locket stared again he was unable to repress an unattenuated You I have some new material said the young man colouring a little That often freshens up an old story It buries it sometimes It s often only another tombstone That depends upon what it is However Peter added the documents I speak of would be a crushing monument Mr Locket hesitating shot another glance under his glasses Do you allude to a revelations Very curious ones Mr Locket still on his feet had kept his body at the bowing angle it was therefore easy for him after an instant to bend a little further and to sink into his chair with a movement of his hand toward the seat Baron had occupied Baron resumed possession of this convenience and the conversation took a fresh start on a basis which such an extension of privilege could render but little less humiliating to our young man He had matured no plan of confiding his secret to Mr Locket and he had really,henryJames
the stigma stands in the mouth of the corolla above the anthers which latter are enclosed within the tube but only a short way down In the short styled form the anthers are placed in the mouth of the corolla above the stigma which occupies the same position as the anthers in the other form being seated only a short way down the tube Therefore the pistil of the long styled form does not exceed in length that of the short styled in nearly so great a degree as in many other Rubiaceae Nevertheless there is a considerable difference in the size of the pollen grains in the two forms for as Fritz Muller informs me those of the short styled are to those of the long styled as to in diameter Houstonia coerulea Rubiaceae Professor Asa Gray has been so kind as to send me an abstract of some observations made by Dr Rothrock on this plant The pistil is exserted in the one form and the stamens in the other as has long been observed The stigmas of the long styled form are shorter stouter and far more hispid than in the other form The stigmatic hairs or papillae on the former are millimetres and on the latter only millimetres in length In the short styled form the anthers are larger and the pollen grains when distended with water are to those from the long styled form as to in diameter Selected capsules from some long styled plants growing in the Botanic Gardens at Cambridge U S near where plants of the other form grew contained on an average seeds but these plants must have been subjected to unfavourable conditions for some long styled plants in a state of nature yielded an average of seeds per capsule Some short styled plants which had been planted by themselves in the Botanic Gardens where it was not likely that they would have been visited by insects that had previously visited long styled plants produced capsules eleven of which were wholly sterile but one contained and another seeds So that the short styled form seems to be very sterile with its own pollen Professor Asa Gray informs me that the other North American species of this genus are likewise heterostyled Oldenlandia sp Rubiaceae Mr J Scott sent me from India dried flowers of a heterostyled species of this genus which is closely allied to the last The pistil in the long styled flowers is longer by about a quarter of its length and the stamens shorter in about the same proportion than the corresponding organs in the short styled flowers In the latter the anthers are longer and the divergent stigmas decidedly longer and apparently thinner than in the long styled form Owing to the state of the specimens I could not decide whether the stigmatic papillae were longer in the one form than in the other The pollen grains distended with water from the short styled flowers were to those from the long styled as to in diameter as deduced from the mean of ten measurements of each kind Hedyotis sp Rubiaceae Fritz Muller sent me from St Catharina in Brazil dried flowers of a small delicate species which grows on wet sand near the edges of fresh water pools In the long styled form the stigma projects above the corolla and stands on a level with the projecting anthers of the short styled form but in the latter the stigmas stand rather beneath the level of the anthers in the other or long styled form these being enclosed within the tube of the corolla The pistil of the long styled form is nearly thrice as long as that of the short styled or speaking strictly as to and the papillae on the stigma of the former are broader in the ratio of to but whether longer than those of the short styled I could not decide In the short styled form the anthers are rather larger and the pollen grains are to those from the long styled flowers as to in diameter Fritz Muller sent me a second small sized species which is likewise heterostyled Coccocypselum sp Rubiaceae Fritz Muller also sent me dried flowers of this plant from St Catharina in Brazil The exserted stigma of the long styled form stands a little above the level of the exserted anthers of the short styled form and the enclosed stigma of the latter also stands a little above the level of the enclosed anthers in the long styled form The pistil of the long styled is about twice as long as that of the short styled with its two stigmas considerably longer more divergent and more curled Fritz Muller informs me that he could detect no difference in the size of the pollen grains in the two forms Nevertheless there can be no doubt that this plant is heterostyled Lipostoma sp Rubiaceae Dried flowers of this plant which grows in small wet ditches in St Catharina in Brazil were likewise sent me by Fritz Muller In the long styled form the exserted stigma stands rather above the level of the exserted anthers of the other form whilst in the short styled form it stands on a level with the anthers of the other form So that the want of strict correspondence in height between the stigmas and anthers in the two forms is reversed compared with what occurs in Hedyotis The long styled pistil is to that of the short styled as to in length and its divergent stigmas are longer by fully one third of their own length than those of the short styled form In the latter the anthers are a little larger and the pollen grains are as to in diameter compared with those from the long styled form Cinchona micrantha Rubiaceae Dried specimens of both forms of this plant were sent me from Kew My attention was called to this plant by a drawing copied,charlesDarwin
running at the call Your mistress has retired I suppose Yes sir a good two hours ago Very good I shall call you myself in the morning He closed my door and the echo of his steps seemed hardly to have died from my ears before I had sunk into that deep and dreamless sleep which only youth and fatigue can give CHAPTER VII THE OWNER OF GROSBOIS My host was as good as his word for when a noise in my room awoke me in the morning it was to find him standing by the side of my bed so composed in his features and so drab in his attire that it was hard to associate him with the stirring scenes of yesterday and with the repulsive part which he had played in them Now in the fresh morning sunlight he presented rather the appearance of a pedantic schoolmaster an impression which was increased by the masterful and yet benevolent smile with which he regarded me In spite of his smile I was more conscious than ever that my whole soul shrank from him and that I should not be at my ease until I had broken this companionship which had been so involuntarily formed He carried a heap of clothes over one arm which he threw upon a chair at the bottom of my bed I gather from the little that you told me last night said he that your wardrobe is at present somewhat scanty I fear that your inches are greater than those of anyone in my household but I have brought a few things here amongst which you may find something to fit you Here too are the razors the soap and the powder box I will return in half an hour when your toilet will doubtless be completed I found that my own clothes with a little brushing were as good as ever but I availed myself of his offer to the extent of a ruffled shirt and a black satin cravat I had finished dressing and was looking out of the window of my room which opened on to a blank wall when my host returned He looked me all over with a keenly scrutinising eye and appeared to be satisfied with what he saw That will do That will do very well indeed said he nodding a critical head In these times a slight indication of travel or hard work upon a costume is more fashionable than the foppishness of the Incroyable I have heard ladies remark that it was in better taste Now sir if you will kindly follow me His solicitude about my dress filled me with surprise but this was soon forgotten in the shock which was awaiting me For as we passed down the passage and into a large hall which seemed strangely familiar to me there was a full length portrait of my father standing right in front of me I stood staring with a gasp of astonishment and turned to see the cold grey eyes of my companion fixed upon me with a humorous glitter You seem surprised Monsieur de Laval said he For God s sake said I do not trifle with me any further Who are you and what is this place to which you have taken me For answer he broke into one of his dry chuckles and laying his skinny brown hand upon my wrist he led me into a large apartment In the centre was a table tastefully laid and beyond it in a low chair a young lady was seated with a book in her hand She rose as we entered and I saw that she was tall and slender with a dark face pronounced features and black eyes of extraordinary brilliancy Even in that one glance it struck me that the expression with which she regarded me was by no means a friendly one Sibylle said my host and his words took the breath from my lips this is your cousin from England Louis de Laval This my dear nephew is my only daughter Sibylle Bernac Then you I am your mother s brother Charles Bernac You are my Uncle Bernac I stammered at him like an idiot But why did you not tell me so I cried I was not sorry to have a chance of quietly observing what his English education had done for my nephew It might also have been harder for me to stand your friend if my comrades had any reason to think that I was personally interested in you But you will permit me now to welcome you heartily to France and to express my regret if your reception has been a rough one I am sure that Sibylle will help me to atone for it He smiled archly at his daughter who continued to regard me with a stony face I looked round me and gradually the spacious room with the weapons upon the wall and the deer s heads came dimly back to my memory That view through the oriel window too with the clump of oaks in the sloping park and the sea in the distance beyond I had certainly seen it before It was true then and I was in our own castle of Grosbois and this dreadful man in the snuff coloured coat this sinister plotter with the death s head face was the man whom I had heard my poor father curse so often the man who had ousted him from his own property and installed himself in his place And yet I could not forget that it was he also who at some risk to himself had saved me the night before and my soul was again torn between my gratitude and my repulsion We had seated ourselves at the table and as we ate this newly found uncle of mine continued to explain all those points which I had failed to understand I suspected that,arthurDoyle
in which it was enclosed It was a beautiful scarab us and at that time unknown to naturalists of course a great prize in a scientific point of view There were two round black spots near one extremity of the back and a long one near the other The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance of burnished gold The weight of the insect was very remarkable and taking all things into consideration I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it but what to make of Legrand s concordance with that opinion I could not for the life of me tell I sent for you said he in a grandiloquent tone when I had completed my examination of the beetle I sent for you that I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug My dear Legrand I cried interrupting him you are certainly unwell and had better use some little precautions You shall go to bed and I will remain with you a few days until you get over this You are feverish and Feel my pulse said he I felt it and to say the truth found not the slightest indication of fever But you may be ill and yet have no fever Allow me this once to prescribe for you In the first place go to bed In the next You are mistaken he interposed I am as well as I can expect to be under the excitement which I suffer If you really wish me well you will relieve this excitement And how is this to be done Very easily Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills upon the main land and in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide You are the only one we can trust Whether we succeed or fail the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed I am anxious to oblige you in any way I replied but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills It has Then Legrand I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding I am sorry very sorry for we shall have to try it by ourselves Try it by yourselves The man is surely mad but stay how long do you propose to be absent Probably all night We shall start immediately and be back at all events by sunrise And will you promise me upon your honor that when this freak of yours is over and the bug business good God settled to your satisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly as that of your physician Yes I promise and now let us be off for we have no time to lose With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend We started about four o clock Legrand Jupiter the dog and myself Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades the whole of which he insisted upon carrying more through fear it seemed to me of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master than from any excess of industry or complaisance His demeanor was dogged in the extreme and dat deuced bug were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey For my own part I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns while Legrand contented himself with the scarab us which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip cord twirling it to and fro with the air of a conjuror as he went When I observed this last plain evidence of my friend s aberration of mind I could scarcely refrain from tears I thought it best however to humor his fancy at least for the present or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success In the mean time I endeavored but all in vain to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than we shall see We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff and ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land proceeded in a northwesterly direction through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen Legrand led the way with decision pausing only for an instant here and there to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion In this manner we journeyed for about two hours and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen It was a species of table land near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill densely wooded from base to pinnacle and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined Deep ravines in various directions gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe and Jupiter by direction of his master proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip tree which stood with some eight or ten oaks upon the level and far surpassed them all and all other trees which I had then ever seen in the beauty of its foliage and form in the wide spread of its branches and in the general majesty,allanPoe
play a little with his dignity I will take the matter into my own hands It is time that the good Colonel came forth to greet his friends else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a sip too much of his Canary wine in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach in honor of the day But since he is so much behindhand I will give him a remembrancer myself Accordingly with such a tramp of his ponderous riding boots as might of itself have been audible in the remotest of the seven gables he advanced to the door which the servant pointed out and made its new panels reecho with a loud free knock Then looking round with a smile to the spectators he awaited a response As none came however he knocked again but with the same unsatisfactory result as at first And now being a trifle choleric in his temperament the lieutenant governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword wherewith he so beat and banged upon the door that as some of the bystanders whispered the racket might have disturbed the dead Be that as it might it seemed to produce no awakening effect on Colonel Pyncheon When the sound subsided the silence through the house was deep dreary and oppressive notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine or spirits Strange forsooth very strange cried the lieutenant governor whose smile was changed to a frown But seeing that our host sets us the good example of forgetting ceremony I shall likewise throw it aside and make free to intrude on his privacy He tried the door which yielded to his hand and was flung wide open by a sudden gust of wind that passed as with a loud sigh from the outermost portal through all the passages and apartments of the new house It rustled the silken garments of the ladies and waved the long curls of the gentlemen s wigs and shook the window hangings and the curtains of the bedchambers causing everywhere a singular stir which yet was more like a hush A shadow of awe and half fearful anticipation nobody knew wherefore nor of what had all at once fallen over the company They thronged however to the now open door pressing the lieutenant governor in the eagerness of their curiosity into the room in advance of them At the first glimpse they beheld nothing extraordinary a handsomely furnished room of moderate size somewhat darkened by curtains books arranged on shelves a large map on the wall and likewise a portrait of Colonel Pyncheon beneath which sat the original Colonel himself in an oaken elbow chair with a pen in his hand Letters parchments and blank sheets of paper were on the table before him He appeared to gaze at the curious crowd in front of which stood the lieutenant governor and there was a frown on his dark and massive countenance as if sternly resentful of the boldness that had impelled them into his private retirement A little boy the Colonel s grandchild and the only human being that ever dared to be familiar with him now made his way among the guests and ran towards the seated figure then pausing halfway he began to shriek with terror The company tremulous as the leaves of a tree when all are shaking together drew nearer and perceived that there was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of Colonel Pyncheon s stare that there was blood on his ruff and that his hoary beard was saturated with it It was too late to give assistance The iron hearted Puritan the relentless persecutor the grasping and strong willed man was dead Dead in his new house There is a tradition only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious awe to a scene perhaps gloomy enough without it that a voice spoke loudly among the guests the tones of which were like those of old Matthew Maule the executed wizard God hath given him blood to drink Thus early had that one guest the only guest who is certain at one time or another to find his way into every human dwelling thus early had Death stepped across the threshold of the House of the Seven Gables Colonel Pyncheon s sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise in its day There were many rumors some of which have vaguely drifted down to the present time how that appearances indicated violence that there were the marks of fingers on his throat and the print of a bloody hand on his plaited ruff and that his peaked beard was dishevelled as if it had been fiercely clutched and pulled It was averred likewise that the lattice window near the Colonel s chair was open and that only a few minutes before the fatal occurrence the figure of a man had been seen clambering over the garden fence in the rear of the house But it were folly to lay any stress on stories of this kind which are sure to spring up around such an event as that now related and which as in the present case sometimes prolong themselves for ages afterwards like the toadstools that indicate where the fallen and buried trunk of a tree has long since mouldered into the earth For our own part we allow them just as little credence as to that other fable of the skeleton hand which the lieutenant governor was said to have seen at the Colonel s throat but which vanished away as he advanced farther into the room Certain it is however that there was a great consultation and dispute of doctors over the dead body One John Swinnerton by name who appears to have been a man of eminence upheld it if we have rightly understood his terms of art,nathanielHawthorne
Elizabeth Refugee Camp says If we had to complain it would be false complaint and all the stories about ill treatment are untrue as far as I can find out Among the women cared for in this camp was one from Jagersfontein who boasted and with truth that she had shot two unarmed British soldiers with a revolver Such is some of the evidence to be placed against Miss Hobhouse s report and that of the unnamed lady in Pretoria In justice it must be acknowledged that some camps may have been more open to criticism than others and that as we should expect they became more perfect with time But I can not believe that any impartial mind can read the evidence without seeing that the British Government was doing its best under difficult circumstances to carry out the most humane plan possible and that any other must involve consequences from which a civilised nation must shrink Towards the end of an attempt was made to lessen the mortality in the camps by bringing them down to the sea coast The problem was complicated by the fact that many of the refugees were averse from leaving their own country and had come in upon a promise that they would not be asked to do so Those who would were moved down and the camps at East London Port Elizabeth and Merebank near Durban largely increased No expense must be allowed to stand in the way said Mr Chamberlain in an official message In Blue Book Cd we find Lord Milner and the Colonial Secretary discussing every means by which the mortality might be lessened and the comfort of the camps increased It is worthy of record that the portrait of an emaciated child has been circulated upon the Continent and in America as a proof positive of the horrors of the concentration system It is only too probable that there are many emaciated children in the camps for they usually arrive in that condition This particular portrait however was as I am credibly informed taken by the British authorities on the occasion of the criminal trial of the mother for the ill usage of the child The incident is characteristic of the unscrupulous tactics which have been used from the beginning to poison the mind of the world against Great Britain CHAPTER VIII THE BRITISH SOLDIER IN SOUTH AFRICA When Lord Roberts desired to sum up the character of the soldiers whom he had led he declared that they had behaved like gentlemen I believe that statement to be no exaggeration and I think that when the bitter animosities of warfare have subsided it will be acknowledged by the Boers themselves that it is true They have had some unsavoury work to do for guerilla warfare brings much in its train which is hateful but officers and men have ameliorated and softened the asperities of warfare wherever it has been possible to do so Their character has been most foully attacked by politicians at home and by the ignorant or malevolent abroad Let us examine the evidence There were many military attach s present with our Army Have any of them reported against the discipline of our soldiers So far as their reports are known nothing of the sort has been alleged Captain Slocum the American representative writes from Bloemfontein The British have been too merciful and I believe had a more rigorous course been adopted when the Army first entered this capital and the enemy thoroughly stampeded the war would have been materially shortened The French military attach said What I admire most in this campaign is the conduct of your soldiers Here they are trekking and fighting daily in an uninteresting country scorched by day cold by night without drink without women Any other soldiers in Europe would have mutinied long ago There were several foreign war correspondents with our army Of these the only Frenchman M Carr re of the Matin was an ardent pro Boer Read his book En pleine Epop e He is bitter against our policy and our politicians His eyes are very keenly open for flaws in our Army But from cover to cover he has nothing but praise for the devoted Tommy and his chivalrous officer Three American correspondents were there there may have been more but three I knew These were Messrs Julian Ralph James Barnes and Unger The first two were much impressed by the humanity and discipline of the British troops though Mr Ralph was I believe like Captain Slocum of the opinion that it was occasionally pushed too far Mr Unger s published impressions of the war confirm the same idea Here then is practical unanimity among all the impartial witnesses On the opinions of our own correspondents I will not dwell I have the advantage of knowing nearly all of them and though among them are several gentlemen who have a chivalrous and idealistic sympathy for the Boers I can not recollect that I have ever once heard one of them record a single instance where they had been shocked by the conduct of a soldier I may perhaps be permitted to add my own testimony I went to South Africa with great sympathy for the individual Boer and with a belief that I should find soldiers in the field very different from soldiers in peace I was three months in Bloemfontein when there were from ten to thirty thousand men encamped round the town During that time I only once saw a man drunk I never saw a man drunk during the short time that I was in Pretoria and Johannesburg I once heard of a soldier striking a Boer It was because the man had refused to raise his hat at the burial of the soldier s comrade I not only never saw any outrage but in many confidential talks with officers I never heard of one I saw twenty Boer prisoners within five,arthurDoyle
of this age a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones have been found of a sort of ape man with a brain case bigger than that of any living apes which seems to have walked erect This creature is now called Pithecanthropus erectus the walking ape man and the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in figuring to ourselves the makers of the Eoliths FLINT IMPLEMENTS FOUND IN PILTDOWN REGION FLINT IMPLEMENTS FOUND IN PILTDOWN REGION Nat Hist Mus It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million years old that we find any other particle of a sub human being But there are plenty of implements and they are steadily improving in quality as we read on through the record They are no longer clumsy Eoliths they are now shapely instruments made with considerable skill And they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made by true man Then in a sandpit at Heidelberg appears a single quasi human jaw bone a clumsy jaw bone absolutely chinless far heavier than a true human jaw bone and narrower so that it is improbable the creature s tongue could have moved about for articulate speech On the strength of this jaw bone scientific men suppose this creature to have been a heavy almost human monster possibly with huge limbs and hands possibly with a thick felt of hair and they call it the Heidelberg Man A THEORETICAL RESTORATION OF THE PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS BY PROF RUTOT A THEORETICAL RESTORATION OF THE PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS BY PROF RUTOT This jaw bone is I think one of the most tormenting objects in the world to our human curiosity To see it is like looking through a defective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing shambling through the bleak wilderness clambering to avoid the sabre toothed tiger watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods Then before we can scrutinize the monster he vanishes Yet the soil is littered abundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses THE HEIDELBERG MAN THE HEIDELBERG MAN The Heidelberg Man as modelled under the supervision of Prof Rutot Still more fascinatingly enigmatical are the remains of a creature found at Piltdown in Sussex in a deposit that may indicate an age between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand years ago though some authorities would put these particular remains back in time to before the Heidelberg jaw bone Here there are the remains of a thick sub human skull much larger than any existing ape s and a chimpanzee like jaw bone which may or may not belong to it and in addition a bat shaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully manufactured through which a hole had apparently been bored There is also the thigh bone of a deer with cuts upon it like a tally That is all THE PILTDOWN SKULL AS RECONSTRUCTED FROM ORIGINAL FRAGMENT THE PILTDOWN SKULL AS RECONSTRUCTED FROM ORIGINAL FRAGMENT Nat Hist Mus What sort of beast was this creature which sat and bored holes in bones Scientific men have named him Eoanthropus the Dawn Man He stands apart from his kindred a very different being either from the Heidelberg creature or from any living ape No other vestige like him is known But the gravels and deposits of from one hundred thousand years onward are increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar stone And these implements are no longer rude Eoliths The arch ologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers borers knives darts throwing stones and hand axes We are drawing very near to man In our next section we shall have to describe the strangest of all these precursors of humanity the Neanderthalers the men who were almost but not quite true men But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no scientific man supposes either of these creatures the Heidelberg Man or Eoanthropus to be direct ancestors of the men of to day These are at the closest related forms X THE NEANDERTHALER AND THE RHODESIAN MAN About fifty or sixty thousand years ago before the climax of the Fourth Glacial Age there lived a creature on earth so like a man that until a few years ago its remains were considered to be altogether human We have skulls and bones of it and a great accumulation of the large implements it made and used It made fires It sheltered in caves from the cold It probably dressed skins roughly and wore them It was right handed as men are Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men They were of a different species of the same genus They had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low foreheads Their thumbs were not opposable to the fingers as men s are their necks were so poised that they could not turn back their heads and look up to the sky They probably slouched along head down and forward Their chinless jaw bones resemble the Heidelberg jaw bone and are markedly unlike human jaw bones And there were great differences from the human pattern in their teeth Their cheek teeth were more complicated in structure than ours more complicated and not less so they had not the long fangs of our cheek teeth and also these quasi men had not the marked canines dog teeth of an ordinary human being The capacity of their skulls was quite human but the brain was bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain Their intellectual faculties were differently arranged They were not ancestral to the human line Mentally and physically they were upon a different line from the human line Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at Neanderthal among other places and from that,hgWells
proposal she replied gaily It s dangerous to propose elopement to a Mormon woman Well I was expecting you Now will be a good hour to show you Milly Erne s grave The day riders have gone and the night riders haven t come in Bern what do you make of that Need I worry You know I have to be made to worry Well it s not usual for the night shift to ride in so late replied Venters slowly and his glance sought Lassiter s Cattle are usually quiet after dark Still I ve known even a coyote to stampede your white herd I refuse to borrow trouble Come said Jane They mounted and with Jane in the lead rode down the lane and turning off into a cattle trail proceeded westward Venters s dogs trotted behind them On this side of the ranch the outlook was different from that on the other the immediate foreground was rough and the sage more rugged and less colorful there were no dark blue lines of canyons to hold the eye nor any uprearing rock walls It was a long roll and slope into gray obscurity Soon Jane left the trail and rode into the sage and presently she dismounted and threw her bridle The men did likewise Then on foot they followed her coming out at length on the rim of a low escarpment She passed by several little ridges of earth to halt before a faintly defined mound It lay in the shade of a sweeping sage brush close to the edge of the promontory and a rider could have jumped his horse over it without recognizing a grave Here She looked sad as she spoke but she offered no explanation for the neglect of an unmarked uncared for grave There was a little bunch of pale sweet lavender daisies doubtless planted there by Jane I only come here to remember and to pray she said But I leave no trail A grave in the sage How lonely this resting place of Milly Erne The cottonwoods or the alfalfa fields were not in sight nor was there any rock or ridge or cedar to lend contrast to the monotony Gray slopes tinging the purple barren and wild with the wind waving the sage swept away to the dim horizon Lassiter looked at the grave and then out into space At that moment he seemed a figure of bronze Jane touched Venters s arm and led him back to the horses Bern cried Jane when they were out of hearing Suppose Lassiter were Milly s husband the father of that little girl lost so long ago It might be Jane Let us ride on If he wants to see us again he ll come So they mounted and rode out to the cattle trail and began to climb From the height of the ridge where they had started down Venters looked back He did not see Lassiter but his glance drawn irresistibly farther out on the gradual slope caught sight of a moving cloud of dust Hello a rider Yes I see said Jane That fellow s riding hard Jane there s something wrong Oh yes there must be How he rides The horse disappeared in the sage and then puffs of dust marked his course He s short cut on us he s making straight for the corrals Venters and Jane galloped their steeds and reined in at the turning of the lane This lane led down to the right of the grove Suddenly into its lower entrance flashed a bay horse Then Venters caught the fast rhythmic beat of pounding hoofs Soon his keen eye recognized the swing of the rider in his saddle It s Judkins your Gentile rider he cried Jane when Judkins rides like that it means hell CHAPTER IV DECEPTION PASS The rider thundered up and almost threw his foam flecked horse in the sudden stop He was a giant form and with fearless eyes Judkins you re all bloody cried Jane in affright Oh you ve been shot Nothin much Miss Withersteen I got a nick in the

Jud they meant to kill you declared Venters Now I wonder returned Judkins They wanted me bad An it ain t regular for rustlers to waste time chasin one rider Thank heaven you got away said Jane But my riders where are they I don t know The night riders weren t there last night when I rode down en this mornin I met no day riders Judkins Bern they ve been set upon killed by Oldring s men I don t

his face some of it between his teeth and of green turf streaming past in front of his eyes He saw the shoulder of the Master Horse vast and sleek with the muscles flowing swiftly under the skin He perceived that his arms were round the neck and that the violent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm Then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree stems and then there were fronds of bracken about and then more open turf Then a stream of pebbles rushing past little pebbles flying sideways athwart the stream from the blow of the swift hoofs Ugh lomi began to feel frightfully sick and giddy but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because he was uncomfortable He dared not leave his grip but he tried to make himself more comfortable He released his hug on the neck gripping the mane instead He slipped his knees forward and pushing back came into a sitting position where the quarters broaden It was nervous work but he managed it and at last he was fairly seated astride breathless indeed and uncertain but with that frightful pounding of his body at any rate relieved Slowly the fragments of Ugh lomi s mind got into order again The pace seemed to him terrific but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust his first frantic terror The air rushed by sweet and wonderful the rhythm of the hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again They were on turf now a wide glade the beech trees a hundred yards away on either side and a succulent band of green starred with pink blossom and shot with silver water here and there meandered down the middle Far off was a glimpse of blue valley far away The exultation grew It was man s first taste of pace Then came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering this way and that and then a couple of jackals mistaking Ugh lomi for a lion came hurrying after him And when they saw it was not a lion they still came on out of curiosity On galloped the horse with his one idea of escape and after him the jackals with pricked ears and quickly barked remarks Which kills which said the first jackal It s the horse being killed said the second They gave the howl of following and the horse answered to it as a horse answers nowadays to the spur On they rushed a little tornado through the quiet day putting up startled birds sending a dozen unexpected things darting to cover raising a myriad of indignant dung flies smashing little blossoms flowering complacently back into their parental turf Trees again and then splash splash across a torrent then a hare shot out of a tuft of grass under the very hoofs of the Master Horse and the jackals left them incontinently So presently they broke into the open again a wide expanse of turfy hillside the very grassy downs that fall northward nowadays from the Epsom Stand The first hot bolt of the Master Horse was long since over He was falling into a measured trot and Ugh lomi albeit bruised exceedingly and quite uncertain of the future was in a state of glorious enjoyment And now came a new development The pace broke again the Master Horse came round on a short curve and stopped dead Ugh lomi became alert He wished he had a flint but the throwing flint he had carried in a thong about his waist was like the axe heaven knows where The Master Horse turned his head and Ugh lomi became aware of an eye and teeth He whipped his leg into a position of security and hit at the cheek with his fist Then the head went down somewhere out of existence apparently and the back he was sitting on flew up into a dome Ugh lomi became a thing of instinct again strictly prehensile he held by knees and feet and his head seemed sliding towards the turf His fingers were twisted into the shock of mane and the rough hair of the horse saved him The gradient he was on lowered again and then Whup said Ugh lomi astonished and the slant was the other way up But Ugh lomi was a thousand generations nearer the primordial than man no monkey could have held on better And the lion had been training the horse for countless generations against the tactics of rolling and rearing back But he kicked like a master and buck jumped rather neatly In five minutes Ugh lomi lived a lifetime If he came off the horse would kill him he felt assured Then the Master Horse decided to stick to his old tactics again and suddenly went off at a gallop He headed down the slope taking the steep places at a rush swerving neither to the right nor to the left and as they rode down the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind the approaching skirmishers of oak and hawthorn They skirted a sudden hollow with the pool of a spring rank weeds and silver bushes The ground grew softer and the grass taller and on the right hand side and the left came scattered bushes of May still splashed with belated blossom Presently the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing rider and little flashes and gouts of blood came out on horse and man Then the way opened again And then came a wonderful adventure A sudden squeal of unreasonable anger rose amidst the bushes the squeal of some creature bitterly wronged And crashing after them appeared a big grey blue shape It was Yaaa the big horned rhinoceros in one of those fits of fury of his charging full tilt after the manner of his kind He had been startled at his feeding and someone it did not,hgWells
suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground So expressive it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famished traveller wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die Some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes had looked up again not with any interest or curiosity but with a dull mechanical perception beforehand that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood was not yet empty I want said Defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker to let in a little more light here You can bear a little more The shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air of listening at the floor on one side of him then similarly at the floor on the other side of him then upward at the speaker What did you say You can bear a little more light I must bear it if you let it in Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word The opened half door was opened a little further and secured at that angle for the time A broad ray of light fell into the garret and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausing in his labour His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench He had a white beard raggedly cut but not very long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair though they had been really otherwise but they were naturally large and looked unnaturally so His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat and showed his body to be withered and worn He and his old canvas frock and his loose stockings and all his poor tatters of clothes had in a long seclusion from direct light and air faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment yellow that it would have been hard to say which was which He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the very bones of it seemed transparent So he sat with a steadfastly vacant gaze pausing in his work He never looked at the figure before him without first looking down on this side of himself then on that as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound he never spoke without first wandering in this manner and forgetting to speak Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to day asked Defarge motioning to Mr Lorry to come forward What did you say Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to day I can t say that I mean to I suppose so I don t know But the question reminded him of his work and he bent over it again Mr Lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the door When he had stood for a minute or two by the side of Defarge the shoemaker looked up He showed no surprise at seeing another figure but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead colour and then the hand dropped to his work and he once more bent over the shoe The look and the action had occupied but an instant You have a visitor you see said Monsieur Defarge What did you say Here is a visitor The shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a hand from his work Come said Defarge Here is monsieur who knows a well made shoe when he sees one Show him that shoe you are working at Take it monsieur Mr Lorry took it in his hand Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the maker s name There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied I forget what it was you asked me What did you say I said couldn t you describe the kind of shoe for monsieur s information It is a lady s shoe It is a young lady s walking shoe It is in the present mode I never saw the mode I have had a pattern in my hand He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride And the maker s name said Defarge Now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right and then passed a hand across his bearded chin and so on in regular changes without a moment s intermission The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon or endeavouring in the hope of some disclosure to stay the spirit of a fast dying man Did you ask me for my name Assuredly I did One Hundred and Five North Tower Is that all One Hundred and Five North Tower With a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to work again until the silence was again broken You are not a shoemaker by trade said Mr Lorry looking steadfastly at him His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him but as no help came from that quarter they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground I am not a shoemaker by trade No I was not a shoemaker by trade I I learnt it here I taught myself I asked leave to He lapsed away even for minutes,charlesDickens
