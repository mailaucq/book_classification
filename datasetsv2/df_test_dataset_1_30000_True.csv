CONTENTS Introduction Author ’ s Preface The Life of Colonel Jacque The True-born Englishman The Shortest Way with the Dissenters ILLUSTRATIONS COLONEL JACQUE PART I Jacque is summoned before his master . _ Frontispiece_ Escaping with the purloined horse . In the sixty-second chapter of _Roderick Random_ , the hero of that novel is profoundly impressed by the genius of the disappointed poet , Melopoyn , the story of whose tragedy is Smollett ’ s acrimonious version of the fate of his own first literary effort , _The Regicide_ . Melopoyn tells Random that while waiting in vain for his tragedy to be produced , he wrote some pastorals which were rejected by one bookseller after another . A first said merely that the pastorals would not serve ; a second advised Melopoyn to offer in their place something “ satirical or luscious ; ” and a third asked if he “ had got never a piece of secret history , thrown into a series of letters , or a volume of adventures , such as those of Robinson Crusoe and Colonel Jack , or a collection of conundrums , wherewith to entertain the plantations ? ” Smollett probably wrote this passage some time in the year 1747 , for _Roderick Random_ was published in January , 1748 . It was twenty-four years earlier—December twentieth , 1722—that _Colonel Jacque_ had been published , or , to give it the name set forth by its flaunting title-page : —_The History and Remarkable Life of the truly Honourable Colonel Jacque , vulgarly called Col. Jack , who was born a Gentleman ; put ’ Prentice to a Pickpocket ; was six and twenty years a Thief , and then kidnapped to Virginia ; came back a Merchant ; was five times married to four Whores ; went into the Wars , behaved bravely , got Preferment , was made Colonel of a Regiment ; came over , and fled with the Chevalier , is still abroad Completing a Life of Wonders , and resolves to die a General_ . Surely a book for servants , readers of our time will be apt to think on looking at this title-page ; and yet _Colonel Jacque_ is found to-day in many a gentleman ’ s library . This is no reason , though , why it should still retain considerable popularity in Smollett ’ s day . In less time after their appearance , some books which live forever in literature have been forgotten by the great mass of readers . What was it now that kept _Colonel Jacque_ popular a quarter of a century after its publication ? It can hardly be the story which maintained its popularity , for the inorganic tale is of the simplest kind . Jacque , like Captain Singleton , and Moll Flanders in her childhood , had almost no knowledge of his parents . He was brought up by a woman who was well paid for taking the child off his parents ’ hands—a woman who , though seemingly an abandoned character , nevertheless showed the boy kindness . When he was about ten , she died . Then followed the chequered career sketched in the title given above . Jacque , trained by a comrade as a pickpocket , became in time a thief on a larger scale , but not a thief quite destitute of good feeling . After he had robbed a poor woman of Kentish Town of 22_s_ . 6½_d_. , his conscience was never easy till he paid her back the money , a year later ; and through all his criminal life , he remembered that his foster-mother had told him he came of gentle blood , and accordingly should remember always to be a gentleman . The hope of being a gentleman was before him , even when he was kidnapped to Virginia and sold into bondage . There he became such a favourite of his master that in time he was able to set up as a planter on his own account . From Virginia he returned to England , and thence , after the unhappy matrimonial ventures mentioned in the title , he went back to Virginia , where at last he married the wife whom he had previously divorced . Nor could the character of the hero have had much to do in keeping _Colonel Jacque_ popular . In spite of his matrimonial achievements , in spite of the affection which he rouses in his American employer and his slaves both , Colonel Jacque is without any attraction which a reader can perceive to-day . His chief interest is commerce ; he is a typical “ Anglo-Saxon ” trader . There are thousands and thousands of such clever , prosy , cold-blooded business-men in the United States to-day , and in the British colonies , and in the United Kingdom . It was the story of Colonel Jacque ’ s successful trading , no doubt , which had a large part in sustaining the popularity of his _History_ . This is less striking in the later pages than in the earlier . Even so , what vividness there is in the American scenes is too largely commercial . Not many people , other than small traders or would-be traders , could ever have read with interest such a paragraph as the following : — “ With the sloop I sent letters to my wife and to my chief manager with orders to load her back , as I there directed , viz. , that she should have two hundred barrels of flour , fifty barrels of pease ; and , to answer my other views , I ordered a hundred bales to be made up of all sorts of European goods , such as not my own warehouses only would supply , but such as they could be supplied with in other warehouses where I knew they had credit for anything. ” Very different are the earlier pages which deal with Jacque ’ s adventures as a poor criminal boy in England . Barring this improbability—one by the way which you are not aware of while you read the scenes in question , for you do not know how long a time will elapse before the hero begins to record his experiences—the verisimilitude of the first part of _Colonel Jacque_ could not be surpassed . And so in the early pages of _Colonel Jacque_ , more than anywhere else , is found the power of the story , the secret of its popularity when Smollett was writing _Roderick Random_ , and the secret of its appeal to readers to-day . The circumstances which led to its publication are set forth by the author himself in his autobiographical sketch of 1715 , _An Appeal to Honour and Justice_ . On the first of August , 1700 , according to his statement , there appeared “ a vile abhorred pamphlet , in very ill verse , written by one Mr. Tutchin , and called _The Foreigners_ ; in which the author . . . fell personally upon the King himself , and then upon the Dutch Nation . And after having reproached his Majesty with crimes that his worst enemy could not think of without horror , he sums up all in the odious name of _Foreigner_ . This filled me with a kind of rage against the book , and gave birth to a trifle which I never could hope should have met with so general an acceptance as it did ; I mean _The True-Born Englishman_. ” The reason for Tutchin ’ s pamphlet was that William III. , never loved by the English , became less and less popular after the death of Queen Mary . A Dutchman , he was supposed to have the interests of Holland more at heart than those of England . This supposition was strengthened by the fact that he took no Englishmen into his confidence as he did his old and trusted Dutch friends . Nor would this nation ever have arrived to the degree of wealth and glory it now boasts of , if the addition of foreign nations . . . had not been helpful to it . “ And lest by length of time it be pretended The climate may this modern breed have mended , Wise Providence , to keep us where we are , Mixes us daily with exceeding care . We have been Europe ’ s sink , the jakes where she Voids all her offal outcast progeny . Among the stanzas in which he hits off the faults of his countrymen , the following , more true than grammatical , is among the most forcible : — “ Surly to strangers , froward to their friend ; Submit to love with a reluctant mind ; Resolved to be ungrateful and unkind . If by necessity reduced to ask , The giver has the difficultest task ; For what ’ s bestow ’ d they awkwardly receive , And always take less freely than they give . The obligation is their highest grief ; And never love , where they accept relief . Written , as it is , in rough verse , at times little better than doggerel , it is yet always vigorous and interesting . That it was effective in accomplishing the purpose for which it was composed , is proved by the fact that the people , taking the satire good-naturedly , experienced a revulsion of feeling towards the king and his Dutch friends . It was written in 1702 , the first year of Anne ’ s reign , when the strong Tory influence in the government seemed likely to bring back the persecution of Nonconformists which had ceased in the time of William . From the early summer , when Dr. Sacheverell preached at Oxford a most inflammatory sermon against the Dissenters , High Church feeling against them grew stronger and stronger . The result was the pamphlet , _The Shortest Way with the Dissenters ; or , Proposals for the Establishment of the Church_ , which appeared on the first of December , 1702 . “ I join with ” the author “ in all he says , ” wrote one of them , [ 3 ] to a friend who had sent him the pamphlet , “ and have such a value for the book , that , next to the Holy Bible and the sacred Comments , I take it for the most valuable piece I have. ” Naturally there was a storm when the truth was discovered and the High Tories found out that what they had praised was ironical . They were immediately shamed into declaring the pamphlet a dangerous libel , intended to stir up the Dissenters to civil war . He gave himself up , was tried , and sentenced to pay a fine of two hundred marks , to stand three times in the pillory , and to go to prison for the Queen ’ s pleasure . G. H. Maynadier . AUTHOR ’ S PREFACE Sir , —It is so customary to write prefaces to all books of this kind , to introduce them with the more advantage into the world , that I can not omit it , though on that account ’ tis thought this work needs a preface less than any that ever went before it . The pleasant and delightful part speaks for itself ; the useful and instructive is so large , and capable of so many improvements , that it would employ a book large as itself to make improvements suitable to the vast variety of the subject . Here ’ s room for just and copious observations on the blessings and advantages of a sober and well-governed education , and the ruin of so many thousands of youths of all kinds in this nation for want of it ; also , how much public schools and charities might be improved to prevent the destruction of so , many unhappy children as in this town are every year bred up for the gallows . The miserable condition of unhappy children , many of whose natural tempers are docible , and would lead them to learn the best things rather than the worst , is truly deplorable , and is abundantly seen in the history of this man ’ s childhood ; where , though circumstances formed him by necessity to be a thief , a strange rectitude of principles remained with him , and made him early abhor the worst part of his trade , and at last wholly leave it off . If he had come into the world with the advantage of education , and been well instructed how to improve the generous principles he had in him , what a man might he not have been ! The various turns of his fortunes in the world make a delightful field for the reader to wander in ; a garden where he may gather wholesome and medicinal fruits , none noxious or poisonous ; where he will see virtue and the ways of wisdom everywhere applauded , honoured , encouraged , rewarded ; vice and all kinds of wickedness attended with misery , many kinds of infelicities ; and at last , sin and shame going together , the persons meeting with reproof and reproach , and the crimes with abhorrence . Every wicked reader will here be encouraged to a change , and it will appear that the best and only good end of an impious , misspent life is repentance ; that in this there is comfort , peace , and oftentimes hope , and that the penitent shall be returned like the prodigal , _and his latter end be better than his beginning_ . While these things , and such as these , are the ends and designs of the whole book , I think I need not say one word more as an apology for any part of the rest—no , nor for the whole . If discouraging everything that is evil , and encouraging everything that is virtuous and good—I say , if these appear to be the whole scope and design of the publishing this story , no objection can lie against it ; neither is it of the least moment to inquire whether the Colonel hath told his own story true or not ; if he has made it a History or a Parable , it will be equally useful , and capable of doing good ; and in that it recommends itself without any introduction.—Your humble servant , The Editor . THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE Seeing my life has been such a chequer-work of nature , and that I am able now to look back upon it from a safer distance than is ordinarily the fate of the clan to which I once belonged , I think my history may find a place in the world as well as some who I see are every day read with pleasure , though they have in them nothing so diverting or instructing as I believe mine will appear to be . My original may be as high as anybody ’ s for aught I know , for my mother kept very good company ; but that part belongs to her story more than to mine . All I know of it is by oral tradition , thus : My nurse told me my mother was a gentlewoman , that my father was a man of quality , and she ( my nurse ) had a good piece of money given her to take me off his hands , and deliver him and my mother from the importunities that usually attend the misfortune of having a child to keep that should not be seen or heard of . My father , it seems , gave my nurse something more than was agreed for , at my mother ’ s request , upon her solemn promise that she would use me well and let me be put to school ; and charged her , that if I lived to come to any bigness , capable to understand the meaning of it , she should always take care to bid me remember that I was a gentleman ; and this , he said , was all the education he would desire of her for me ; for he did not doubt , he said , but that , some time or other , the very hint would inspire me with thoughts suitable to my birth , and that I would certainly act like a gentleman , if I believed myself to be so . But my disasters were not directed to end as soon as they began . It is very seldom that the unfortunate are so but for a day ; as the great rise by degrees of greatness to the pitch of glory in which they shine , so the miserable sink to the depth of their misery by a continued series of disasters , and are long in the tortures and agonies of their distressed circumstances , before a turn of fortune , if ever such a thing happens to them , gives them a prospect of deliverance . My nurse was as honest to the engagement she had entered into as could be expected from one of her employment , and particularly as honest as her circumstances would give her leave to be ; for she bred me up very carefully with her own son , and with another son of shame like me , whom she had taken upon the same terms . My name was John , as she told me , but neither she or I knew anything of a surname that belonged to me ; so I was left to call myself Mr . Anything , what I pleased , as fortune and better circumstances should give occasion . It happened that her own son ( for she had a little boy of her own , about one year older than I ) was called John too ; and about two years after she took another son of shame , as I called it above , to keep as she did me , and his name was John too . As we were all Johns , we were all Jacques , and soon came to be called so ; for at that part of the town where we had our breeding , viz. , near Goodman ’ s Fields , the Johns are generally called Jacque ; but my nurse , who may be allowed to distinguish her own son a little from the rest , would have him called captain , because , forsooth , he was the eldest . I was provoked at having this boy called captain , and I cried , and told my nurse I would be called captain ; for she told me I was a gentleman , and I would be a captain , that I would . The good woman , to keep the peace , told me , ay , ay , I was a gentleman , and therefore I should be above a captain , for I should be a colonel , and that was a great deal better than a captain ; “ for , my dear , ” says she , “ every tarpauling , if he gets but to be lieutenant of a press smack , is called captain , but colonels are soldiers , and none but gentlemen are ever made colonels . Besides , ” says she , “ I have known colonels come to be lords and generals , though they were bastards at first , and therefore you shall be called colonel. ” Well , I was hushed indeed with this for the present , but not thoroughly pleased , till , a little while after , I heard her tell her own boy that I was a gentleman , and therefore he must call me colonel ; at which her boy fell a-crying , and he would be called colonel . That part pleased me to the life , that he should cry to be called colonel , for then I was satisfied that it was above a captain : so universally is ambition seated in the minds of men that not a beggar-boy but has his share of it . So here was Colonel Jacque and Captain Jacque . As for the third boy , he was only plain Jacque for some years after , till he came to preferment by the merit of his birth , as you shall hear in its place . We were hopeful boys , all three of us , and promised very early , by many repeated circumstances of our lives , that we would be all rogues ; and yet I can not say , if what I have heard of my nurse ’ s character be true , but the honest woman did what she could to prevent it . Before I tell you much more of our story , it would be very proper to give you something of our several characters , as I have gathered them up in my memory , as far back as I can recover things , either of myself or my brother Jacques , and they shall be brief and impartial . Captain Jacque was the eldest of us all , by a whole year . He was a squat , big , strong-made boy , and promised to be stout when grown up to be a man , but not to be tall . His temper was sly , sullen , reserved , malicious , revengeful ; and , withal , he was brutish , bloody , and cruel in his disposition . He was , as to manners , a mere boor , or clown , of a carman-like breed ; sharp as a street-bred boy must be , but ignorant and unteachable from a child . He had much the nature of a bull-dog , bold and desperate , but not generous at all . All the schoolmistresses we went to could never make him learn—no , not so much as to make him know his letters ; and as if he was born a thief , he would steal everything that came near him , even as soon almost as he could speak ; and that not from his mother only , but from anybody else , and from us too that were his brethren and companions . He was an original rogue , for he would do the foulest and most villainous things , even by his own inclination ; he had no taste or sense of being honest—no , not , I say , to his brother rogues , which is what other thieves make a point of honour of ; I mean that of being honest to one another . The other , that is to say , the youngest of us Johns , was called Major Jacque , by the accident following : The lady that had deposited him with our nurse had owned to her that it was a major of the Guards that was the father of the child , but that she was obliged to conceal his name , and that was enough . So he was at first called John the Major , and afterwards the Major ; and at last , when we came to rove together , Major Jacque , according to the rest , for his name was John , as I have observed already . Major Jacque was a merry , facetious , pleasant boy , had a good share of wit , especially off-hand-wit , as they call it ; was full of jests and good humour , and , as I often said , had something of a gentleman in him . He had a true manly courage , feared nothing , and could look death in the face without any hesitation ; and yet , if he had the advantage , was the most generous and most compassionate creature alive . He had native principles of gallantry in him , without anything of the brutal or terrible part that the captain had ; and , in a word , he wanted nothing but honesty to have made him an excellent man . He had learned to read , as I had done ; and as he talked very well , so he wrote good sense and very handsome language , as you will see in the process of his story . As for your humble servant , Colonel Jacque , he was a poor , unhappy , tractable dog , willing enough , and capable too , to learn anything , if he had had any but the devil for his schoolmaster . He set out into the world so early , that when he began to do evil , he understood nothing of the wickedness of it , nor what he had to expect for it . I remember very well that when I was once carried before a justice , for a theft which indeed I was not guilty of , and defended myself by argument , proving the mistakes of my accusers , and how they contradicted themselves , the justice told me it was a pity I had not been better employed , for I was certainly better taught ; in which , however , his worship was mistaken , for I had never been taught anything but to be a thief ; except , as I said , to read and write , and that was all , before I was ten years old ; but I had a natural talent of talking , and could say as much to the purpose as most people that had been taught no more than I. I passed among my comrades for a bold , resolute boy , and one that durst fight anything ; but I had a different opinion of myself , and therefore shunned fighting as much as I could , though sometimes I ventured too , and came off well , being very strong made and nimble withal . However , I many times brought myself off with my tongue , where my hands would not have been sufficient , and this as well after I was a man as while I was a boy . I was wary and dexterous at my trade , and was not so often catched as my fellow-rogues—I mean while I was a boy , and never after I came to be a man ; no , not once for twenty-six years , being so old in the trade , and still unhanged , as you shall hear . As for my person , while I was a dirty glass-bottle-house boy , sleeping in the ashes , and dealing always in the street dirt , it can not be expected but that I looked like what I was , and so we did all ; that is to say , like a “ black-your-shoes-your-honour , ” a beggar-boy , a blackguard-boy , or what you please , despicable and miserable to the last degree ; and yet I remember the people would say of me , “ That boy has a good face ; if he was washed and well dressed , he would be a good , pretty boy . Do but look ; what eyes he has ; what a pleasant , smiling countenance ! ’ Tis a pity . I wonder what the rogue ’ s father and mother was , ” and the like . Then they would call me , and ask me my name , and I would tell them my name was Jacque . “ But what ’ s your surname , sirrah ? ” says they . “ I don ’ t know , ” says I . “ Who is your father and mother ? ” “ I have none , ” said I . “ What , and never had you any ? ” said they . “ No , ” says I , “ not that I know of. ” Then they would shake their heads and cry , “ Poor boy ! ” and “ ’ Tis a pity , ” and the like ; and so let me go . But I laid up all these things in my heart . I was almost ten years old , the captain eleven , and the major about eight , when the good woman my nurse died . Her husband was a seaman , and had been drowned a little before in the _Gloucester_ frigate , one of the king ’ s ships which was cast away going to Scotland with the Duke of York in the time of King Charles II. , and the honest woman dying very poor , the parish was obliged to bury her ; when the three young Jacques attended her corpse , and I , the colonel ( for we all passed for her own children ) , was chief mourner ; the captain , who was the eldest son , going back very sick . The good woman being dead , we , the three Jacques , were turned loose to the world . As to the parish providing for us , we did not trouble ourselves much about that ; we rambled about all three together , and the people in Rosemary Lane and Ratcliff , and that way , knowing us pretty well , we got victuals easily enough and without much begging . For my particular part , I got some reputation for a mighty civil , honest boy ; for if I was sent off an errand , I always did it punctually and carefully , and made haste again ; and if I was trusted with any thing , I never touched it to diminish it , but made it a point of honour to be punctual to whatever was committed to me , though I was as arrant a thief as any of them in all other cases . In like case , some of the poorer shopkeepers would often leave me at their door , to look after their shops till they went up to dinner , or till they went over the way to an alehouse , and the like , and I always did it freely and cheerfully , and with the utmost honesty . Captain Jacque , on the contrary , a surly , ill-looking , rough boy , had not a word in his mouth that savoured either of good manners or good humour ; he would say “ Yes ” and “ No , ” just as he was asked a question , and that was all , but nobody got any thing from him that was obliging in the least . If he was sent off an errand he would forget half of it , and it may be go to play , if he met any boys , and never go at all , or if he went , never come back with an answer , which was such a regardless , disobliging way that nobody had a good word for him , and everybody said he had the very look of a rogue , and would come to be hanged . In a word , he got nothing of anybody for goodwill , but was , as it were , obliged to turn thief for the mere necessity of bread to eat ; for if he begged , he did it with so ill a tone , rather like bidding folks give him victuals than entreating them , that one man , of whom he had something given , and knew him , told him one day , “ Captain Jacque , ” says he , “ thou art but an awkward , ugly sort of a beggar , now thou art a boy ; I doubt thou wilt be fitter to ask a man for his purse than for a penny when thou comest to be a man. ” The major was a merry , thoughtless fellow , always cheerful ; whether he had any victuals or no , he never complained ; and he recommended himself so well by his good carriage that the neighbours loved him , and he got victuals enough , one where or other . Thus we all made a shift , though we were so little , to keep from starving ; and as for lodging , we lay in the summer-time about the watch-houses and on bulkheads and shop-doors , where we were known . As for a bed , we knew nothing what belonged to it for many years after my nurse died ; and in winter we got into the ash-holes and nealing-arches in the glass-house , called Dallow ’ s Glass-house , in Rosemary Lane , or at another glass-house in Ratcliff Highway . In this manner we lived for some years ; and here we failed not to fall among a gang of naked , ragged rogues like ourselves , wicked as the devil could desire to have them be at so early an age , and ripe for all the other parts of mischief that suited them as they advanced in years . I remember that one cold winter night we were disturbed in our rest with a constable and his watch crying out for one Wry-neck , who , it seems , had done some roguery , and required a hue-and-cry of that kind ; and the watch were informed he was to be found among the beggar-boys under the nealing-arches in the glass-house . The alarm being given , we were awakened in the dead of the night with “ Come out here , ye crew of young devils ; come out and show yourselves ; ” so we were all produced . Some came out rubbing their eyes and scratching their heads , and others were dragged out ; and I think there was about seventeen of us in all , but Wry-neck as they called him , was not among them . It seems this was a good big boy , that used to be among the inhabitants of that place , and had been concerned in a robbery the night before , in which his comrade , who was taken , in hopes of escaping punishment , had discovered him , and informed where he usually harboured ; but he was aware , it seems , and had secured himself , at least for that time . So we were allowed to return to our warm apartment among the coal-ashes , where I slept many a cold winter night ; nay , I may say , many a winter , as sound and as comfortably as ever I did since , though in better lodgings . In this manner of living we went on a good while , I believe two years , and neither did or meant any harm . We generally went all three together ; for , in short , the captain , for want of address , and for something disagreeable in him , would have starved if we had not kept him with us . As we were always together , we were generally known by the name of the three Jacques ; but Colonel Jacque had always the preference , upon many accounts . The major , as I have said , was merry and pleasant , but the colonel always held talk with the better sort—I mean the better sort of those that would converse with a beggar-boy . In this way of talk I was always upon the inquiry , asking questions of things done in public , as well as in private ; particularly , I loved to talk with seamen and soldiers about the war , and about the great sea-fights or battles on shore that any of them had been in ; and , as I never forgot anything they told me , I could soon , that is to say , in a few years , give almost as good an account of the Dutch war , and of the fights at sea , the battles in Flanders , the taking of Maestricht , and the like , as any of those that had been there ; and this made those old soldiers and tars love to talk with me too , and to tell me all the stories they could think of , and that not only of the wars then going on , but also of the wars in Oliver ’ s time , the death of King Charles I. , and the like . By this means , as young as I was , I was a kind of an historian ; and though I had read no books , and never had any books to read , yet I could give a tolerable account of what had been done and of what was then a-doing in the world , especially in those things that our own people were concerned in . I knew the names of every ship in the navy , and who commanded them too , and all this before I was fourteen years old , or but very soon after . Captain Jacque in this time fell into bad company , and went away from us , and it was a good while before we ever heard tale or tidings of him , till about half a year , I think , or thereabouts . I understood he was got among a gang of kidnappers , as they were then called , being a sort of wicked fellows that used to spirit people ’ s children away ; that is , snatch them up in the dark , and , stopping their mouths , carry them to such houses where they had rogues ready to receive them , and so carry them on board ships bound to Virginia , and sell them . This was a trade that horrid Jacque , for so I called him when we were grown up , was very fit for , especially the violent part ; for if a little child got into his clutches , he would stop the breath of it , instead of stopping its mouth , and never troubled his head with the child ’ s being almost strangled , so he did but keep it from making a noise . There was , it seems , some villainous thing done by this gang about that time , whether a child was murdered among them , or a child otherwise abused ; but it seems it was a child of an eminent citizen , and the parent somehow or other got a scent of the thing , so that they recovered their child , though in a sad condition , and almost killed . I was too young , and it was too long ago , for me to remember the whole story , but they were all taken up and sent to Newgate , and Captain Jacque among the rest , though he was but young , for he was not then much above thirteen years old . What punishment was inflicted upon the rogues of that gang I can not tell now , but the captain , being but a lad , was ordered to be three times soundly whipped at Bridewell , my Lord Mayor , or the Recorder , telling him it was done in pity to him , to keep him from the gallows , not forgetting to tell him that he had a hanging look , and bid him have a care on that very account ; so remarkable was the captain ’ s countenance , even so young , and which he heard of afterwards on many occasions . When he was in Bridewell I heard of his misfortune , and the major and I went to see him ; for this was the first news we heard of what became of him . The very day that we went he was called out to be corrected , as they called it , according to his sentence ; and as it was ordered to be done soundly , so indeed they were true to the sentence ; for the alderman who was the president of Bridewell , and whom I think they called Sir William Turner , held preaching to him about how young he was , and what pity it was such a youth should come to be hanged , and a great deal more ; how he should take warning by it , and how wicked a thing it was that they should steal away poor innocent children , and the like ; and all this while the man with a blue badge on lashed him most unmercifully , for he was not to leave off till Sir William knocked with a little hammer on the table . The poor captain stamped and danced , and roared out like a mad boy ; and I must confess I was frighted almost to death ; for though I could not come near enough , being but a poor boy , to see how he was handled , yet I saw him afterwards with his back all wealed with the lashes , and in several places bloody , and thought I should have died with the sight of it ; but I grew better acquainted with those things afterwards . I did what I could to comfort the poor captain when I got leave to come to him . But the worst was not over with him , for he was to have two more such whippings before they had done with him ; and indeed they scourged him so severely that they made him sick of the kidnapping trade for a great while ; but he fell in among them again , and kept among them as long as that trade lasted , for it ceased in a few years afterwards . The major and I , though very young , had sensible impressions made upon us for some time by the severe usage of the captain , and it might be very well said we were corrected as well as he , though not concerned in the crime ; but it was within the year that the major , a good-conditioned , easy boy , was wheedled away by a couple of young rogues that frequented the glass-house apartments , to take a walk with them , as they were pleased to call it . The gentlemen were very well matched ; the major was about twelve years old , and the oldest of the two that led him out was not above fourteen . The business was to go to Bartholomew Fair , and the end of going to Bartholomew Fair was , in short , to pick pockets . The major knew nothing of the trade , and therefore was to do nothing ; but they promised him a share with them for all that , as if he had been as expert as themselves . So away they went . The two dexterous young rogues managed it so well that by eight o ’ clock at night they came back to our dusty quarters at the glass-house , and , sitting them down in a corner , they began to share their spoil , by the light of the glass-house fire . The major lugged out the goods , for as fast as they made any purchase they unloaded themselves , and gave all to him , that , if they had been taken , nothing might be found about them . It was a devilish lucky day to them , the devil certainly assisting them to find their prey , that he might draw in a young gamester , and encourage him to the undertaking , who had been made backward before by the misfortune of the captain . The list of their purchase the first night was as follows : — 1 . A white handkerchief from a country wench , as she was staring up at a jack-pudding ; there was 3s . 6d . and a row of pins tied up in one end of it . 2 . A coloured handkerchief , out of a young country fellow ’ s pocket as he was buying a china orange . 3 . A riband purse with 11s . 3d . and a silver thimble in it , out of a young woman ’ s pocket , just as a fellow offered to pick her up . _N.B_.—She missed her purse presently , but , not seeing the thief , charged the man with it that would have picked her up , and cried out , “ A pickpocket ! ” and he fell into the hands of the mob , but , being known in the street , he got off with great difficulty . 4 . A knife and fork , that a couple of boys had just bought and were going home with ; the young rogue that took it got it within the minute after the boy had put it in his pocket . 5 . A little silver box with 7s . in it , all in small silver , 1d. , 2d. , 3d. , 4d . pieces . _N.B_.—This , it seems , a maid pulled out of her pocket , to pay at her going into the booth to see a show , and the little rogue got his hand in and fetched it off , just as she put it up again . 6 . Another silk handkerchief , out of a gentleman ’ s pocket . 7 . Another . 8 . A jointed baby and a little looking-glass , stolen off a toy-seller ’ s stall in the fair . All this cargo to be brought home clear in one afternoon , or evening rather , and by only two little rogues so young , was , it must be confessed , extraordinary ; and the major was elevated the next day to a strange degree . He came very early to me , who lay not far from him , and said to me , “ Colonel Jacque , I want to speak with you. ” “ Well , ” said I , “ what do you say ? ” “ Nay , ” said he , “ it is business of consequence ; I can not talk here ; ” so we walked out . As soon as we were come out into a narrow lane by the glass-house , “ Look here , ” says he , and pulls out his little hand almost full of money . I was surprised at the sight , when he puts it up again , and , bringing his hand out , “ Here , ” says he , “ you shall have some of it ; ” and gives me a sixpence and a shilling ’ s worth of the small silver pieces . This was very welcome to me , who , as much as I was of a gentleman , and as much as I thought of myself upon that account , never had a shilling of money together before in all my life , not that I could call my own . I was very earnest then to know how he came by this wealth , for he had for his share 7s . 6d . in money , the silver thimble , and a silk handkerchief , which was , in short , an estate to him , that never had , as I said of myself , a shilling together in his life . “ And what will you do with it now , Jacque ? ” said I . “ I do ? ” says he . “ The first thing I do I ’ ll go into Rag Fair and buy me a pair of shoes and stockings. ” “ That ’ s right , ” says I , “ and so will I too ; ” so away we went together , and we bought each of us a pair of Rag Fair stockings in the first place for fivepence ; not fivepence a pair , but fivepence together ; and good stockings they were too , much above our wear , I assure you . We found it more difficult to fit ourselves with shoes ; but at last , having looked a great while before we could find any good enough for us , we found a shop very well stored , and of these we bought two pair for sixteenpence . We put them on immediately , to our great comfort , for we had neither of us had any stockings to our legs that had any feet to them for a long time . I found myself so refreshed with having a pair of warm stockings on , and a pair of dry shoes—things , I say , which I had not been acquainted with a great while—that I began to call to my mind my being a gentleman , and now I thought it began to come to pass . When we had thus fitted ourselves I said , “ Hark ye , Major Jacque , you and I never had any money in our lives before , and we never had a good dinner in all our lives . What if we should go somewhere and get some victuals ? I am very hungry. ” “ So we will , then , ” says the major ; “ I am hungry too. ” So we went to a boiling cook ’ s in Rosemary Lane , where we treated ourselves nobly , and , as I thought with myself , we began to live like gentlemen , for we had three pennyworth of boiled beef , two pennyworth of pudding , a penny brick ( as they call it , or loaf ) , and a whole pint of strong beer , which was sevenpence in all . _N.B_.—We had each of us a good mess of charming beef-broth into the bargain ; and , which cheered my heart wonderfully , all the while we were at dinner , the maid and the boy in the house , every time they passed by the open box where we sat at our dinner , would look in and cry , “ Gentlemen , do you call ? ” and “ Do ye call , gentlemen ? ” I say , this was as good to me as all my dinner . Not the best housekeeper in Stepney parish , not my Lord Mayor of London , no , not the greatest man on earth , could be more happy in their own imagination , and with less mixture of grief or reflection , than I was at this new piece of felicity ; though mine was but a small part of it , for Major Jacque had an estate compared to me , as I had an estate compared to what I had before ; in a word , nothing but an utter ignorance of greater felicity , which was my case , could make anybody think himself so exalted as I did , though I had no share of this booty but eighteenpence . That night the major and I triumphed in our new enjoyment , and slept with an undisturbed repose in the usual place , surrounded with the warmth of the glass-house fires above , which was a full amends for all the ashes and cinders which we rolled in below . Those who know the position of the glass-houses , and the arches where they neal the bottles after they are made , know that those places where the ashes are cast , and where the poor boys lie , are cavities in the brickwork , perfectly close , except at the entrance , and consequently warm as the dressing-room of a bagnio , that it is impossible they can feel any cold there , were it in Greenland or Nova Zembla , and that therefore the boys lie there not only safe , but very comfortably , the ashes excepted , which are no grievance at all to them . The next day the major and his comrades went abroad again , and were still successful ; nor did any disaster attend them , for I know not how many months ; and , by frequent imitation and direction , Major Jacque became as dexterous a pickpocket as any of them , and went on through a long variety of fortunes , too long to enter upon now , because I am hastening to my own story , which at present is the main thing I have to set down . The major failed not to let me see every day the effects of his new prosperity , and was so bountiful as frequently to throw me a tester , sometimes a shilling ; and I might perceive that he began to have clothes on his back , to leave the ash-hole , having gotten a society lodging ( of which I may give an explanation by itself on another occasion ) ; and which was more , he took upon him to wear a shirt , which was what neither he or I had ventured to do for three years before , and upward . But I observed all this while , that though Major Jacque was so prosperous and had thriven so well , and notwithstanding he was very kind , and even generous , to me , in giving me money upon many occasions , yet he never invited me to enter myself into the society or to embark with him , whereby I might have been made as happy as he ; no , nor did he recommend the employment to me at all . I was not very well pleased with his being thus reserved to me . I had learned from him in general that the business was picking of pockets , and I fancied that though the ingenuity of the trade consisted very much in sleight-of-hand , a good address , and being very nimble , yet that it was not at all difficult to learn ; and , especially , I thought the opportunities were so many , the country people that come to London so foolish , so gaping , and so engaged in looking about them , that it was a trade with no great hazard annexed to it , and might be easily learned , if I did but know in general the manner of it , and how they went about it . The subtle devil , never absent from his business , but ready at all occasions to encourage his servants , removed all these difficulties , and brought him into an intimacy with one of the most exquisite divers , or pickpockets , in the town ; and this , our intimacy , was of no less a kind than that , as I had an inclination to be as wicked as any of them , he was for taking care that I should not be disappointed . He was above the little fellows who went about stealing trifles and baubles in Bartholomew Fair , and ran the risk of being mobbed for three or four shillings . His aim was at higher things , even at no less than considerable sums of money , and bills for more . He solicited me earnestly to go and take a walk with him as above , adding that after he had shown me my trade a little , he would let me be as wicked as I would ; that is , as he expressed it , that after he had made me capable , I should set up for myself , if I pleased , and he would only wish me good luck . Accordingly , as Major Jacque went with his gentlemen only to see the manner , and receive the purchase , and yet come in for a share ; so he told me , if he had success , I should have my share as much as if I had been principal ; and this he assured me was a custom of the trade , in order to encourage young beginners , and bring them into the trade with courage , for that nothing was to be done if a man had not the heart of the lion . I hesitated at the matter a great while , objecting the hazard , and telling the story of Captain Jacque , my elder brother , as I might call him . “ Well , colonel , ” says he , “ I find you are faint-hearted , and to be faint-hearted is indeed to be unfit for our trade , for nothing but a bold heart can go through stitch with this work ; but , however , as there is nothing for you to do , so there is no risk for you to run in these things the first time . If I am taken , ” says he , “ you have nothing to do in it ; they will let you go free ; for it shall easily be made appear , that whatever I have done , you had no hand in it. ” Upon these persuasions I ventured out with him ; but I soon found that my new friend was a thief of quality , and a pickpocket above the ordinary rank , and that aimed higher abundantly than my brother Jacque . He was a bigger boy than I a great deal ; for though I was now near fifteen years old , I was not big of my age ; and as to the nature of the thing , I was perfectly a stranger to it . I knew indeed what at first I did not , for it was a good while before I understood the thing as an offence . I looked on picking pockets as a kind of trade , and thought I was to go apprentice to it . It is true this was when I was young in the society , as well as younger in years , but even now I understood it to be only a thing for which , if we were catched , we ran the risk of being ducked or pumped , which we call soaking , and then all was over ; and we made nothing of having our rags wetted a little ; but I never understood , till a great while after , that the crime was capital , and that we might be sent to Newgate for it , till a great fellow , almost a man , one of our society , was hanged for it ; and then I was terribly frighted , as you shall hear by-and-by . Well , upon the persuasions of this lad , I walked out with him ; a poor innocent boy , and ( as I remember my very thoughts perfectly well ) I had no evil in my intentions . I had never stolen anything in my life ; and if a goldsmith had left me in his shop , with heaps of money strewed all round me , and bade me look after it , I should not have touched it , I was so honest ; but the subtle tempter baited his hook for me , as I was a child , in a manner suited to my childishness , for I never took this picking of pockets to be dishonesty , but , as I have said above , I looked on it as a kind of trade that I was to be bred up to , and so I entered upon it , till I became hardened in it beyond the power of retreating . And thus I was made a thief involuntarily , and went on a length that few boys do , without coming to the common period of that kind of life—I mean to the transport-ship , or to the gallows . The first day I went abroad with my new instructor , he carried me directly into the city , and as we went first to the water-side , he led me into the long-room at the custom-house . We were but a couple of ragged boys at best , but I was much the worse . My leader had a hat on , a shirt , and a neckcloth ; as for me , I had neither of the three , nor had I spoiled my manners so much as to have a hat on my head since my nurse died , which was now some years . His orders to me were to keep always in sight , and near him , but not close to him , nor to take any notice of him at any time till he came to me ; and if any hurly-burly happened , I should by no means know him , or pretend to have anything to do with him . I observed my orders to a tittle . While he peered into every corner and had his eye upon everybody , I kept my eye directly upon him , but went always at a distance , and on the other side of the long-room , looking as it were for pins , and picking them up out of the dust as I could find them , and then sticking them on my sleeve , where I had at last gotten forty or fifty good pins ; but still my eye was upon my comrade , who , I observed , was very busy among the crowds of people that stood at the board doing business with the officers who pass the entries and make the cockets , & c. At length he comes over to me , and stooping as if he would take up a pin close to me , he put some thing into my hand , and said , “ Put that up , and follow me downstairs quickly. ” He did not run , but shuffled along apace through the crowd , and went down , not the great stairs which we came in at , but a little narrow staircase at the other end of the long-room . I followed , and he found I did , and so went on , not stopping below , as I expected , nor speaking one word to me , till , through innumerable narrow passages , alleys , and dark ways , we were got up into Fenchurch Street , and through Billiter Lane into Leadenhall Street , and from thence into Leadenhall Market . It was not a meat-market day , so we had room to sit down upon one of the butchers ’ stalls , and he bid me lug out . What he had given me was a little leather letter-case , with a French almanac stuck in the inside of it , and a great many papers in it of several kinds . We looked them over , and found there was several valuable bills in it , such as bills of exchange and other notes , things I did not understand ; but among the rest was a goldsmith ’ s note , as he called it , of one Sir Stephen Evans , for £300 , payable to the bearer , and at demand . Besides this , there was another note for £12 , 10s. , being a goldsmith ’ s bill too , but I forget the name . There was a bill or two also written in French , which neither of us understood , but which , it seems , were things of value , being called foreign bills accepted . The rogue , my master , knew what belonged to the goldsmiths ’ bills well enough , and I observed , when he read the bill of Sir Stephen , he said , “ This is too big for me to meddle with ; ” but when he came to the bill £12 , 10s. , he said to me , “ This will do . Come hither , Jacque ; ” so away he runs to Lombard Street , and I after him , huddling the other papers into the letter-case . As he went along he inquired the name out immediately , and went directly to the shop , put on a good , grave countenance , and had the money paid him without any stop or question asked . I stood on the other side the way looking about the street , as not at all concerned with anybody that way , but observed that when he presented the bill he pulled out the letter-case , as if he had been a merchant ’ s boy , acquainted with business , and had other bills about him . They paid him the money in gold , and he made haste enough in telling it over , and came away , passing by me , and going into Three King Court , on the other side of the way ; then we crossed back into Clement ’ s Lane , made the best of our way to Cole Harbour , at the water-side , and got a sculler for a penny to carry us over the water to St. Mary Overy ’ s stairs , where we landed , and were safe enough . Here he turns to me ; “ Colonel Jacque , ” says he , “ I believe you are a lucky boy ; this is a good job . We ’ ll go away to St. George ’ s Fields and share our booty. ” Away we went to the Fields , and sitting down in the grass , far enough out of the path , he pulled out the money . “ Look here , Jacque , ” says he , “ did you ever see the like before in your life ? ” “ No , never , ” says I ; and added very innocently , “ Must we have it all ? ” “ We have it ! ” says he , “ who should have it ? ” “ Why , ” says I , “ must the man have none of it again that lost it ? ” “ He have it again ! ” says he . “ What d ’ ye mean by that ? ” “ Nay , I don ’ t know , ” says I . “ Why , you said just now you would let him have the t ’ other bill again , that you said was too big for you. ” He laughed at me . “ You are but a little boy , ” says he , “ that ’ s true , but I thought you had not been such a child neither ; ” so he mighty gravely explained the thing to me thus : that the bill of Sir Stephen Evans was a great bill for £300 , “ and if I , ” says he , “ that am but a poor lad , should venture to go for the money , they will presently say , how should I come by such a bill , and that I certainly found it or stole it ; so they will stop me , ” says he , “ and take it away from me , and it may bring me into trouble for it too ; so , ” says he , “ I did say it was too big for me to meddle with , and that I would let the man have it again , if I could tell how . But for the money , Jacque , the money that we have got , I warrant you he should have none of that . Besides , ” says he , “ whoever he be that has lost this letter-case , to be sure , as soon as he missed it , he would run to the goldsmith and give notice that if anybody came for the money they would be stopped ; but I am too old for him there , ” says he . “ Why , ” says I , “ and what will you do with the bill ? Will you throw it away ? If you do , somebody else will find it , ” says I , “ and they will go and take the money. ” “ No , no , ” says he ; “ then they will be stopped and examined , as I tell you I should be. ” I did not know well what all this meant , so I talked no more about that ; but we fell to handling the money . As for me , I had never seen so much together in all my life , nor did I know what in the world to do with it , and once or twice I was a-going to bid him keep it for me , which would have been done like a child indeed , for , to be sure , I had never heard a word more of it , though nothing had befallen him . However , as I happened to hold my tongue as to that part , he shared the money very honestly with me ; only at the end he told me , that though it was true he promised me half , yet as it was the first time , and I had done nothing but look on , so he thought it was very well if I took a little less than he did ; so he divided the money , which was £12 , 10s. , into two exact parts , viz. , £6 , 5s . in each part ; then he took £1 , 5s . from my part , and told me I should give him that for hansel . “ Well , ” says I , “ take it , then , for I think you deserve it all : ” so , however , I took up the rest , and “ What shall I do with this now , ” says I , “ for I have nowhere to put it ? ” “ Why , have you no pockets ? ” says he . “ Yes , ” says I ; “ but they are full of holes. ” I have often thought since that , and with some mirth too , how I had really more wealth than I knew what to do with ; for lodging I had none , nor any box or drawer to hide my money in ; nor had I any pocket , but such as I say was full of holes . I knew nobody in the world that I could go and desire them to lay it up for me ; for , being a poor naked , ragged boy , they would presently say I had robbed somebody , and perhaps lay hold of me , and my money would be my crime , as they say it often is in foreign countries . And now , as I was full of wealth , behold I was full of care , for what to do to secure my money I could not tell ; and this held me so long , and was so vexatious to me the next day , that I truly sat down and cried . Nothing could be more perplexing than this money was to me all that night . I carried it in my hand a good while , for it was in gold , all but 14s . ; and that is to say , it was in four guineas , and that 14s . was more difficult to carry than the four guineas . At last I sat down and pulled off one of my shoes , and put the four guineas into that ; but after I had gone a while , my shoe hurt me so I could not go , so I was fain to sit down again and take it out of my shoe , and carry it in my hand . Then I found a dirty linen rag in the street , and I took that up and wrapped it all together , and carried it in that a good way . I have often since heard people say , when they have been talking of money that they could not get in , “ I wish I had it in a foul clout ; ” in truth , I had mine in a foul clout ; for it was foul , according to the letter of that saying , but it served me till I came to a convenient place , and then I sat down and washed the cloth in the kennel , and so then put my money in again . Well , I carried it home with me to my lodging in the glass-house , and when I went to go to sleep I knew not what to do with it . If I had let any of the black crew I was with know of it , I should have been smothered in the ashes for it , or robbed of it , or some trick or other put upon me for it ; so I knew not what to do , but lay with it in my hand , and my hand in my bosom . But then sleep went from my eyes . Oh , the weight of human care ! I , a poor beggar-boy , could not sleep so soon as I had but a little money to keep , who before that could have slept upon a heap of brick-bats , or stones , or cinders , or anywhere , as sound as a rich man does on his down bed , and sounder too . Every now and then dropping asleep , I should dream that my money was lost , and start like one frighted ; then , finding it fast in my hand , try to go to sleep again , but could not for a long while ; then drop and start again . At last a fancy came into my head that if I fell asleep I should dream of the money , and talk of it in my sleep , and tell that I had money , which if I should do , and one of the rogues should hear me , they would pick it out of my bosom , and of my hand too , without waking me ; and after that thought I could not sleep a wink more ; so that I passed that night over in care and anxiety enough ; and this , I may safely say , was the first night ’ s rest that I lost by the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches . As soon as it was day I got out of the hole we lay in , and rambled abroad in the fields towards Stepney , and there I mused and considered what I should do with this money , and many a time I wished that I had not had it ; for , after all my ruminating upon it , and what course I should take with it , or where I should put it , I could not hit upon any one thing , or any possible method to secure it , and it perplexed me so that at last , as I said just now , I sat down and cried heartily . When my crying was over the case was the same ; I had the money still , and what to do with it I could not tell . At last it came into my head that I would look out for some hole in a tree , and seek to hide it there till I should have occasion for it . Big was this discovery , as I then thought it . I began to look about me for a tree ; but there were no trees in the fields about Stepney or Mile End that looked fit for my purpose ; and if there were any that I began to look narrowly at , the fields were so full of people that they would see if I went to hide any thing there ; and I thought the people eyed me as it was , and that two men in particular followed me to see what I intended to do . This drove me farther off , and I crossed the road at Mile End , and in the middle of the town went down a lane that goes away to the Blind Beggar ’ s at Bethnal Green . When I came a little way in the lane I found a footpath over the fields , and in those fields several trees for my turn , as I thought . At last one tree had a little hole in it , pretty high out of my reach , and I climbed up the tree to get it , and when I came there I put my hand in , and found ( as I thought ) a place very fit , so I placed my treasure there , and was mighty well satisfied with it ; but , behold , putting my hand in again to lay it more commodiously , as I thought , of a sudden it slipped away from me , and I found the tree was hollow , and my little parcel was fallen in quite out of my reach , and how far it might go in I knew not ; so that , in a word , my money was quite gone , irrecoverably lost . There could be no room so much as to hope ever to see it again , for ’ twas a vast great tree . As young as I was , I was now sensible what a fool I was before , that I could not think of ways to keep my money , but I must come thus far to throw it into a hole where I could not reach it . Well , I thrust my hand quite up to my elbow , but no bottom was to be found , or any end of the hole or cavity . I got a stick of the tree , and thrust it in a great way , but all was one . Then I cried , nay , roared out , I was in such a passion . Then I got down the tree again , then up again , and thrust in my hand again till I scratched my arm and made it bleed , and cried all the while most violently . Then I began to think I had not so much as a halfpenny of it left for a halfpenny roll , and I was hungry , and then I cried again . Then I came away in despair , crying and roaring like a little boy that had been whipped ; then I went back again to the tree , and up the tree again , and thus I did several times . The last time I had gotten up the tree I happened to come down not on the same side that I went up and came down before , but on the other side of the tree , and on the side of the bank also ; and , behold , the tree had a great open place in the side of it close to the ground , as old hollow trees often have ; and looking into the open place , to my inexpressible joy , there lay my money and my linen rag , all wrapped up just as I had put it into the hole ; for the tree being hollow all the way up , there had been some moss or light stuff , which I had not judgment enough to know was not firm , and had given way when it came to drop out of my hand , and so it had slipped quite down at once . I was but a child , and I rejoiced like a child , for I halloed quite out loud when I saw it ; then I ran to it , and snatched it up , hugged and kissed the dirty rag a hundred times ; then danced and jumped about , ran from one end of the field to the other , and , in short , I knew not what ; much less do I know now what I did , though I shall never forget the thing , either what a sinking grief it was to my heart when I thought I had lost it , or what a flood of joy overwhelmed me when I had got it again . While I was in the first transport of my joy , as I have said , I ran about , and knew not what I did ; but when that was over I sat down , opened the foul clout the money was in , looked at it , told it , found it was all there , and then I fell a-crying as savourly as I did before , when I thought I had lost it . It would tire the reader should I dwell on all the little boyish tricks that I played in the ecstasy of my joy and satisfaction when I had found my money ; so I break off here . Joy is as extravagant as grief , and since I have been a man I have often thought , that had such a thing befallen a man , so to have lost all he had , and not have a bit of bread to eat , and then so strangely to find it again , after having given it so effectually over—I say , had it been so with a man , it might have hazarded his using some violence upon himself . Well , I came away with my money , and having taken sixpence out of it , before I made it up again I went to a chandler ’ s shop in Mile End and bought a halfpenny roll and a halfpenny worth of cheese , and sat down at the door after I bought it , and ate it very heartily , and begged some beer to drink with it , which the good woman gave me very freely . Away I went then for the town , to see if I could find any of my companions , and resolved I would try no more hollow trees for my treasure . As I came along Whitechapel I came by a broker ’ s shop over against the church , where they sold old clothes , for I had nothing on but the worst of rags ; so I stopped at the shop , and stood looking at the clothes which hung at the door . “ Well , young gentleman , ” says a man that stood at the door , “ you look wishfully . Do you see any thing you like , and will your pocket compass a good coat now , for you look as if you belonged to the ragged regiment ? ” I was affronted at the fellow . “ What ’ s that to you , ” says I , “ how ragged I am ? If I had seen anything I liked , I have money to pay for it ; but I can go where I shan ’ t be huffed at for looking. ” While I said thus pretty boldly to the fellow comes a woman out . “ What ails you , ” says she to the man , “ to bully away our customers so ? A poor boy ’ s money is as good as my Lord Mayor ’ s . If poor people did not buy old clothes , what would become of our business ? ” And then turning to me , “ Come hither , child , ” says she ; “ if thou hast a mind to anything I have , you shan ’ t be hectored by him . The boy is a pretty boy , I assure you , ” says she to another woman that was by this time come to her . “ Ay , ” says the t ’ other , “ so he is , a very well-looking child , if he was clean and well dressed , and may be as good a gentleman ’ s son , for anything we know , as any of those that are well dressed . Come , my dear , ” says she , “ tell me what is it you would have. ” She pleased me mightily to hear her talk of my being a gentleman ’ s son , and it brought former things to my mind ; but when she talked of my being not clean and in rags , then I cried . She pressed me to tell her if I saw anything that I wanted . I told her no , all the clothes I saw there were too big for me . “ Come , child , ” says she , “ I have two things here that will fit you , and I am sure you want them both ; that is , first , a little hat , and there , ” says she ( tossing it to me ) , “ I ’ ll give you that for nothing . And here is a good warm pair of breeches ; I dare say , ” says she , “ they will fit you , and they are very tight and good ; and , ” says she , “ if you should ever come to have so much money that you don ’ t know what to do with it , here are excellent good pockets , ” says she , “ and a little fob to put your gold in , or your watch in , when you get it. ” It struck me with a strange kind of joy that I should have a place to put my money in , and need not go to hide it again in a hollow tree , that I was ready to snatch the breeches out of her hands , and wondered that I should be such a fool never to think of buying me a pair of breeches before , that I might have a pocket to put my money in , and not carry it about two days together in my hand , and in my shoes and I knew not how ; so , in a word , I gave her two shillings for the breeches , and went over into the churchyard and put them on , put my money into my new pockets , and was as pleased as a prince is with his coach and six horses . I thanked the good woman too for the hat , and told her I would come again when I got more money , and buy some other things I wanted ; and so I came away . I was but a boy , ’ tis true , but I thought myself a man , now I had got a pocket to put my money in , and I went directly to find out my companion by whose means I got it ; but I was frighted out of my wits when I heard that he was carried to Bridewell . I made no question but it was for the letter-case , and that I should be carried there too ; and then my poor brother Captain Jacque ’ s case came into my head , and that I should be whipped there as cruelly as he was , and I was in such a fright that I knew not what to do . But in the afternoon I met him ; he had been carried to Bridewell , it seems , upon that very affair , but was got out again . The case was thus : having had such good luck at the custom-house the day before , he takes his walk thither again , and as he was in the long-room , gaping and staring about him , a fellow lays hold of him , and calls to one of the clerks that sat behind , “ Here , ” says he , “ is the same young rogue that I told you I saw loitering about t ’ other day , when the gentleman lost his letter-case and his goldsmiths ’ bills ; I dare say it was he that stole them. ” Immediately the whole crowd of people gathered about the boy , and charged him point-blank ; but he was too well used to such things to be frighted into a confession of what he knew they could not prove , for he had nothing about him belonging to it , nor had any money but six pence and a few dirty farthings . They threatened him , and pulled and hauled him , till they almost pulled the clothes off his back , and the commissioners examined him ; but all was one ; he would own nothing , but said he walked up through the room , only to see the place , both then and the time before , for he had owned he was there before ; so , as there was no proof against him of any fact , no , nor of any circumstances relating to the letter-case , they were forced at last to let him go . However , they made a show of carrying him to Bridewell , and they did carry him to the gate to see if they could make him confess anything ; but he would confess nothing , and they had no mittimus ; so they durst not carry him into the house ; nor would the people have received him , I suppose , if they had , they having no warrant for putting him in prison . Well , when they could get nothing out of him , they carried him into an alehouse , and there they told him that the letter-case had bills in it of a very great value ; that they would be of no use to the rogue that had them , but they would be of infinite damage to the gentleman that had lost them ; and that he had left word with the clerk , whom the man that stopped this boy had called to , and who was there with him , that he would give £30 to any one that would bring them again , and give all the security that could be desired that he would give them no trouble , whoever it was . He was just come from out of their hands when I met with him , and so he told me all the story . “ But , ” says he , “ I would confess nothing , and so I got off , and am come away clear. ” “ Well , ” says I , “ and what will you do with the letter-case and the bills ? Will you not let the poor man have his bills again ? ” “ No , not I , ” says he ; “ I won ’ t trust them . What care I for their bills ? ” It came into my head , as young as I was , that it was a sad thing indeed to take a man ’ s bills away for so much money , and not have any advantage by it neither ; for I concluded that the gentleman who owned the bills must lose all the money , and it was strange he should keep the bills , and make a gentleman lose so much money for nothing . I remember that I ruminated very much about it , and though I did not understand it very well , yet it lay upon my mind , and I said every now and then to him , “ Do let the gentleman have his bills again ; do , pray do ; ” and so I teased him , with “ Do ” and “ Pray do , ” till at last I cried about them . He said , “ What , would you have me be found out and sent to Bridewell , and be whipped , as your brother Captain Jacque was ? ” I said , “ No , I would not have you whipped , but I would have the man have his bills , for they will do you no good , but the gentleman will be undone , it may be. ” And then I added again , “ Do let him have them. ” He snapped me short . “ Why , ” says he , “ how shall I get them to him ? Who dare carry them ? I dare not , to be sure , for they will stop me , and bring the goldsmith to see if he does not know me , and that I received the money , and so they will prove the robbery , and I shall be hanged . Would you have me be hanged , Jacque ? ” I was silenced a good while with that , for when he said , “ Would you have me be hanged , Jacque ? ” I had no more to say . But one day after this he called to me . “ Colonel Jacque , ” says he , “ I have thought of a way how the gentleman shall have his bills again ; and you and I shall get a good deal of money by it , if you will be honest to me , as I was to you. ” “ Indeed , ” says I , “ Robin ” —that was his name— “ I will be very honest ; let me know how it is , for I would fain have him have his bills. ” “ Why , ” says he , “ they told me that he had left word at the clerk ’ s place in the long-room that he would give £30 to any one that had the bills , and would restore them , and would ask no questions . Now , if you will go , like a poor innocent boy , as you are , into the long-room and speak to the clerk , it may do . Tell him if the gentleman will do as he promised , you believe you can tell him who has it ; and if they are civil to you , and willing to be as good as their words , you shall have the letter-case , and give it them. ” I told him ay , I would go with all my heart . “ But , Colonel Jacque , ” says he , “ what if they should take hold of you and threaten to have you whipped ? Won ’ t you discover me to them ? ” “ No , ” says I ; “ if they would whip me to death I won ’ t. ” “ Well , then , ” says he , “ there ’ s the letter-case ; do you go. ” So he gave me directions how to act and what to say ; but I would not take the letter-case with me , lest they should prove false , and take hold of me , thinking to find it upon me , and so charge me with the fact ; so I left it with him . And the next morning I went to the custom-house , as was agreed . What my directions were will , to avoid repetition , appear in what happened ; it was an errand of too much consequence indeed to be entrusted to a boy , not only so young as I was , but so little of a rogue as I was yet arrived to the degree of . Two things I was particularly armed with , which I resolved upon : 1 . That the man should have his bills again ; for it seemed a horrible thing to me that he should be made to lose his money , which I supposed he must , purely because we would not carry the letter-case home . 2 . That whatever happened to me , I was never to tell the name of my comrade Robin , who had been the principal . With these two pieces of honesty , for such they were both in themselves , and with a manly heart , though a boy ’ s head , I went up into the long-room in the custom-house the next day . As soon as I came to the place where the thing was done , I saw the man sit just where he had sat before , and it ran in my head that he had sat there ever since ; but I knew no better ; so I went up , and stood just at that side of the writing-board that goes upon that side of the room , and which I was but just tall enough to lay my arms upon . While I stood there one thrust me this way , and another thrust me that way , and the man that sat behind began to look at me . At last he called out to me , “ What does that boy do there ? Get you gone , sirrah ! Are you one of the rogues that stole the gentleman ’ s letter-case a Monday last ? ” Then he turns his tale to a gentleman that was doing business with him , and goes on thus : “ Here was Mr. —— had a very unlucky chance on Monday last . Did not you hear of it ? ” “ No , not I , ” says the gentleman . “ Why , standing just there , where you do , ” says he , “ making his entries , he pulled out his letter-case , and laid it down , as he says , but just at his hand , while he reached over to the standish there for a penful of ink , and somebody stole away his letter-case. ” “ His letter-case ! ” says t ’ other . “ What , and was there any bills in it ? ” “ Ay , ” says he , “ there was Sir Stephen Evans ’ s note in it for £300 , and another goldsmith ’ s bill for about £12 ; and which is worse still for the gentleman , he had two foreign accepted bills in it for a great sum—I know not how much . I think one was a French bill for 1200 crowns. ” “ And who could it be ? ” says the gentleman . “ Nobody knows , ” says he ; “ but one of our room-keepers says he saw a couple of young rogues like that , ” pointing at me , “ hanging about here , and that on a sudden they were both gone. ” “ Villains ! ” says he again . “ Why , what can they do with them ? They will be of no use to them . I suppose he went immediately and gave notice to prevent the payment. ” “ Yes , ” says the clerk , “ he did ; but the rogues were too nimble for him with the little bill of £12 odd money ; they went and got the money for that , but all the rest are stopped . However , ’ tis an unspeakable damage to him for want of his money. ” “ Why , he should publish a reward for the encouragement of those that have them to bring them again ; they would be glad to bring them , I warrant you. ” “ He has posted it up at the door that he will give £30 for them. ” “ Ay ; but he should add that he will promise not to stop or give any trouble to the person that brings them. ” “ He has done that too , ” says he ; “ but I fear they won ’ t trust themselves to be honest , for fear he should break his word. ” “ Why ? It is true he may break his word in that case , but no man should do so ; for then no rogue will venture to bring home anything that is stolen , and so he would do an injury to others after him. ” “ I durst pawn my life for him , he would scorn it. ” Thus far they discoursed of it , and then went off to something else . I heard it all , but did not know what to do a great while ; but at last , watching the gentleman that went away , when he was gone I ran after him to have spoken to him , intending to have broke it to him , but he went hastily into a room or two full of people at the hither end of the long-room ; and when I went to follow , the doorkeepers turned me back , and told me I must not go in there ; so I went back , and loitered about near the man that sat behind the board , and hung about there till I found the clock struck twelve , and the room began to be thin of people ; and at last he sat there writing , but nobody stood at the board before him , as there had all the rest of the morning . Then I came a little nearer , and stood close to the board , as I did before ; when , looking up from his paper , and seeing me , says he to me , “ You have been up and down here all this morning , sirrah ! What do you want ? You have some business that is not very good , I doubt. ” “ No , I han ’ t , ” said I . “ No ? It is well if you han ’ t , ” says he . “ Pray , what business can you have in the long-room , sir ? You are no merchant. ” “ I would speak with you , ” said I . “ With me ! ” says he . “ What have you to say to me ? ” “ I have something to say , ” said I , “ if you will do me no harm for it. ” “ I do thee harm , child ! What harm should I do thee ? ” and spoke very kindly . “ Won ’ t you indeed , sir ? ” said I . “ No , not I , child ; I ’ ll do thee no harm . What is it ? Do you know anything of the gentleman ’ s letter-case ? ” I answered , but spoke softly that he could not hear me ; so he gets over presently into the seat next him , and opens a place that was made to come out , and bade me come in to him ; and I did . Then he asked me again if I knew anything of the letter-case . I spoke softly again , and said folks would hear him . Then he whispered softly , and asked me again . I told him I believed I did , but that , indeed , I had it not , nor had no hand in stealing it , but it was gotten into the hands of a boy that would have burned it , if it had not been for me ; and that I heard him say that the gentleman would be glad to have them again , and give a good deal of money for them . “ I did say so , child , ” said he ; “ and if you can get them for him , he shall give you a good reward , no less than £30 , as he has promised. ” “ But you said too , sir , to the gentleman just now , ” said I , “ that you was sure he would not bring them into any harm that should bring them. ” “ No , you shall come to no harm . I will pass my word for it. ” _Boy_ . Nor shan ’ t they make me bring other people into trouble ? _Gent_ . No ; you shall not be asked the name of anybody , nor to tell who they are . _Boy_ . I am but a poor boy , and I would fain have the gentleman have his bills ; and indeed I did not take them away , nor I han ’ t got them . _Gent_ . But can you tell how the gentleman shall have them ? _Boy_ . If I can get them , I will bring them to you to-morrow morning . _Gent_ . Can you not do it to-night ? _Boy_ . I believe I may if I knew where to come . _Gent_ . Come to my house , child . _Boy_ . I don ’ t know where you live . _Gent_ . Go along with me now , and you shall see . So he carried me up into Tower Street , and showed me his house , and ordered me to come there at five o ’ clock at night ; which accordingly I did , and carried the letter-case with me . When I came the gentleman asked me if I had brought the book , as he called it . “ It is not a book , ” said I . “ No , the letter-case ; that ’ s all one , ” says he . “ You promised me , ” said I , “ you would not hurt me , ” and cried . “ Don ’ t be afraid , child , ” says he . “ I will not hurt thee , poor boy ; nobody shall hurt thee. ” “ Here it is , ” said I , and pulled it out . He then brought in another gentleman , who , it seems , owned the letter-case , and asked him if that was it , and he said , “ Yes. ” Then he asked me if all the bills were in it . I told him I heard him say there was one gone , but I believed there was all the rest . “ Why do you believe so ? ” says he . “ Because I heard the boy that I believe stole them say they were too big for him to meddle with. ” The gentleman then that owned them said , “ Where is the boy ? ” Then the other gentleman put in , and said , “ No , you must not ask him that ; I passed my word that you should not , and that he should not be obliged to tell it to anybody. ” “ Well , child , ” says he , “ you will let us see the letter-case opened , and whether the bills are in it ? ” “ Yes , ” says I . Then the first gentleman said , “ How many bills were there in it ? ” “ Only three , ” says he . “ Besides the bill of £12 , 10s. , there was Sir Stephen Evans ’ s note for £300 and two foreign bills. ” “ Well , then , if they are in the letter-case , the boy shall have £30 , shall he not ? ” “ Yes , ” says the gentleman ; “ he shall have it very freely. ” “ Come , then , child , ” says he , “ let me open it. ” So I gave it him , and he opened it , and there were all three bills , and several other papers , fair and safe , nothing defaced or diminished ; and the gentleman said , “ All is right. ” Then said the first man , “ Then I am security to the poor boy for the money. ” “ Well , but , ” says the gentleman , “ the rogues have got the £12 , 10s . ; they ought to reckon that as part of the £30. ” Had he asked me , I should have consented to it at first word ; but the first man stood my friend . “ Nay , ” says he , “ it was since you knew that the £12 , 10s . was received that you offered £30 for the other bills , and published it by the crier , and posted it up at the custom-house door , and I promised him the £30 this morning. ” They argued long , and I thought would have quarrelled about it . However , at last they both yielded a little , and the gentleman gave me £25 in good guineas . When he gave it me he bade me hold out my hand , and he told the money into my hand ; and when he had done he asked me if it was right . I said I did not know , but I believed it was . “ Why , ” says he , “ can ’ t you tell it ? ” I told him no ; I never saw so much money in my life , nor I did not know how to tell money . “ Why , ” says he , “ don ’ t you know that they are guineas ? ” No , I told him , I did not know how much a guinea was . “ Why , then , ” says he , “ did you tell me you believed it was right ? ” I told him , because I believed he would not give it me wrong . “ Poor child , ” says he , “ thou knowest little of the world , indeed . What art thou ? ” “ I am a poor boy , ” says I , and cried . “ What is your name ? ” says he . “ But hold , I forgot , ” said he ; “ I promised I would not ask your name , so you need not tell me. ” “ My name is Jacque , ” said I . “ Why , have you no surname ? ” said he . “ What is that ? ” said I . “ You have some other name besides Jacque , ” says he , “ han ’ t you ? ” “ Yes , ” says I ; “ they call me Colonel Jacque. ” “ But have you no other name ? ” “ No , ” said I . “ How came you to be Colonel Jacque , pray ? ” “ They say , ” said I , “ my father ’ s name was Colonel. ” “ Is your father or mother alive ? ” said he . “ No , ” said I ; “ my father is dead. ” “ Where is your mother , then ? ” said he . “ I never had e ’ er a mother , ” said I . This made him laugh . “ What , ” said he , “ had you never a mother ? What , then ? ” “ I had a nurse , ” said I ; “ but she was not my mother. ” “ Well , ” says he to the gentleman , “ I dare say this boy was not the thief that stole your bills. ” “ Indeed , sir , I did not steal them , ” said I , and cried again . “ No , no , child , ” said he , “ we don ’ t believe you did . This is a very clever boy , ” says he to the other gentleman , “ and yet very ignorant and honest ; ’ tis pity some care should not be taken of him , and something done for him . Let us talk a little more with him. ” So they sat down and drank wine , and gave me some , and then the first gentleman talked to me again . “ Well , ” says he , “ what wilt thou do with this money now thou hast it ? ” “ I don ’ t know , ” said I . “ Where will you put it ? ” said he , “ In my pocket , ” said I . “ In your pocket ! ” said he . “ Is your pocket whole ? Shan ’ t you lose it ? ” “ Yes , ” said I , “ my pocket is whole. ” “ And where will you put it when you get home ? ” “ I have no home , ” said I , and cried again . “ Poor child ! ” said he . “ Then what dost thou do for thy living ? ” “ I go of errands , ” said I , “ for the folks in Rosemary Lane. ” “ And what dost thou do for a lodging at night ? ” “ I lie at the glass-house , ” said I , “ at night. ” “ How , lie at the glass-house ! Have they any beds there ? ” says he . “ I never lay in a bed in my life , ” said I , “ as I remember. ” “ Why , ” says he , “ what do you lie on at the glass-house ? ” “ The ground , ” says I ; “ and sometimes a little straw , or upon the warm ashes. ” Here the gentleman that lost the bills said , “ This poor child is enough to make a man weep for the miseries of human nature , and be thankful for himself ; he puts tears into my eyes. ” “ And into mine too , ” says the other . “ Well , but hark ye , Jacque , ” says the first gentleman , “ do they give you no money when they send you of errands ? ” “ They give me victuals , ” said I , “ and that ’ s better. ” “ But what , ” says he , “ do you do for clothes ? ” “ They give me sometimes old things , ” said I , “ such as they have to spare. ” “ Why , you have never a shirt on , I believe , ” said he , “ have you ? ” “ No ; I never had a shirt , ” said I , “ since my nurse died. ” “ How long ago is that ? ” said he . “ Six winters , when this is out , ” said I . “ Why , how old are you ? ” said he . “ I can ’ t tell , ” said I . “ Well , ” says the gentleman , “ now you have this money , won ’ t you buy some clothes and a shirt with some of it ? ” “ Yes , ” said I , “ I would buy some clothes. ” “ And what will you do with the rest ? ” “ I can ’ t tell , ” said I , and cried . “ What dost cry for , Jacque ? ” said he . “ I am afraid , ” said I , and cried still . “ What art afraid of ? ” “ They will know I have money. ” “ Well , and what then ? ” “ Then I must sleep no more in the warm glass house , and I shall be starved with cold . They will take away my money. ” “ But why must you sleep there no more ? ” Here the gentlemen observed to one another how naturally anxiety and perplexity attend those that have money . “ I warrant you , ” says the clerk , “ when this poor boy had no money he slept all night in the straw , or on the warm ashes in the glass-house , as soundly and as void of care as it would be possible for any creature to do ; but now , as soon as he has gotten money , the care of preserving it brings tears into his eyes and fear into his heart. ” They asked me a great many questions more , to which I answered in my childish way as well as I could , but so as pleased them well enough . At last I was going away with a heavy pocket , and I assure you not a light heart , for I was so frighted with having so much money that I knew not what in the earth to do with myself . I went away , however , and walked a little way , but I could not tell what to do ; so , after rambling two hours or thereabout , I went back again , and sat down at the gentleman ’ s door , and there I cried as long as I had any moisture in my head to make tears of , but never knocked at the door . I had not sat long , I suppose , but somebody belonging to the family got knowledge of it , and a maid came and talked to me , but I said little to her , only cried still . At length it came to the gentleman ’ s ears . As for the merchant , he was gone . When the gentleman heard of me he called me in , and began to talk with me again , and asked me what I stayed for . I told him I had not stayed there all that while , for I had been gone a great while , and was come again . “ Well , ” says he , “ but what did you come again for ? ” “ I can ’ t tell , ” says I . “ And what do you cry so for ? ” said he . “ I hope you have not lost your money , have you ? ” No , I told him , I had not lost it yet , but was afraid I should . “ And does that make you cry ? ” says he . I told him yes , for I knew I should not be able to keep it , but they would cheat me of it , or they would kill me and take it away from me too . “ They ? ” says he . “ Who ? What sort of gangs of people art thou with ? ” I told him they were all boys , but very wicked boys ; “ thieves and pickpockets , ” said I , “ such as stole this letter-case—a sad pack ; I can ’ t abide them. ” “ Well , Jacque , ” said he , “ what shall be done for thee ? Will you leave it with me ? Shall I keep it for you ? ” “ Yes , ” said I , “ with all my heart , if you please. ” “ Come , then , ” says he , “ give it me ; and that you may be sure that I have it , and you shall have it honestly again , I ’ ll give you a bill for it , and for the interest of it , and that you may keep safe enough . Nay , ” added he , “ and if you lose it , or anybody takes it from you , none shall receive the money but yourself , or any part of it. ” I presently pulled out all the money , and gave it to him , only keeping about 15s . for myself to buy some clothes ; and thus ended the conference between us on the first occasion , at least for the first time . Having thus secured my money to my full satisfaction , I was then perfectly easy , and accordingly the sad thoughts that afflicted my mind before began to vanish away . This was enough to let any one see how all the sorrows and anxieties of men ’ s lives come about ; how they rise from their restless pushing at getting of money , and the restless cares of keeping it when they have got it . I that had nothing , and had not known what it was to have had anything , knew nothing of the care , either of getting or of keeping it ; I wanted nothing , who wanted everything ; I had no care , no concern about where I should get my victuals or how I should lodge ; I knew not what money was , or what to do with it ; and never knew what it was not to sleep till I had money to keep , and was afraid of losing it . I had , without doubt , an opportunity at this time , if I had not been too foolish , and too much a child to speak for myself—I had an opportunity , I say , to have got into the service , or perhaps to be under some of the care and concern , of these gentlemen ; for they seemed to be very fond of doing some thing for me , and were surprised at the innocence of my talk to them , as well as at the misery ( as they thought it ) of my condition . But I acted indeed like a child ; and leaving my money , as I have said , I never went near them for several years after . What course I took , and what befell me in that interval , has so much variety in it , and carries so much instruction in it , that it requires an account of it by itself . The first happy chance that offered itself to me in the world was now over . I had got money , but I neither knew the value of it or the use of it ; the way of living I had begun was so natural to me , I had no notion of bettering it ; I had not so much as any desire of buying me any clothes—no , not so much as a shirt ; and much less had I any thought of getting any other lodging than in the glass-house , and loitering about the streets , as I had done ; for I knew no good , and had tasted no evil ; that is to say , the life I had led being not evil in my account . In this state of ignorance I returned to my really miserable life ; so it was in itself , and was only not so to me because I did not understand how to judge of it , and had known no better . My comrade that gave me back the bills , and who , if I had not pressed him , designed never to have restored them , never asked me what I had given me , but told me if they gave me anything it should be my own ; for , as he said he would not run the venture of being seen in the restoring them , I deserved the reward if there was any ; neither did he trouble his head with inquiring what I had , or whether I had anything or no ; so my title to what I had got was clear . I went now up and down just as I did before . I had money indeed in my pocket , but I let nobody know it . I went of errands cheerfully as before , and accepted of what anybody gave me with as much thankfulness as ever . The only difference that I made with myself was , that if I was hungry , and nobody employed me , or gave me anything to eat , I did not beg from door to door , as I did at first , but went to a boiling-house , as I said once before , and got a mess of broth and a piece of bread , price a halfpenny ; very seldom any meat ; or if I treated myself , it was a halfpennyworth of cheese ; all which expense did not amount to above twopence or three pence a week ; for , contrary to the usage of the rest of the tribe , I was extremely frugal , and I had not disposed of any of the guineas which I had at first ; neither , as I said to the custom-house gentleman , could I tell what a guinea was made of , or what it was worth . After I had been about a month thus , and had done nothing , my comrade , as I called him , came to me one morning . “ Colonel Jacque , ” says he , “ when shall you and I take a walk again ? ” “ When you will , ” said I . “ Have you got no business yet ? ” says he . “ No , ” says I ; and so one thing bringing on another , he told me I was a fortunate wretch , and he believed I would be so again , but that he must make a new bargain with me now ; “ for , ” says he , “ colonel , the first time we always let a raw brother come in for full share to encourage him ; but afterwards , except it be when he puts himself forward well and runs equal hazard , he stands to courtesy ; but as we are gentlemen , we always do very honourably by one another ; and if you are willing to trust it or leave it to me , I shall do handsomely by you , that you may depend upon. ” I told him I was not able to do anything , that was certain , for I did not understand it , and therefore I could not expect to get anything , but I would do as he bade me ; so we walked abroad together . We went no more to the custom-house ; it was too bold a venture . Besides , I did not care to show myself again , especially with him in company . But we went directly to the Exchange , and we hankered about in Castle Alley , and in Swithin ’ s Alley , and at the coffee-house doors . It was a very unlucky day , for we got nothing all day but two or three handkerchiefs , and came home to the old lodgings at the glass-house ; nor had I had anything to eat or drink all day but a piece of bread which he gave me , and some water at the conduit at the Exchange Gate . So when he was gone from me , for he did not lie in the glass-house , as I did , I went to my old broth-house for my usual bait , and refreshed myself , and the next day early went to meet him again , as he appointed me . Being early in the morning , he took his walk to Billingsgate , where it seems two sorts of people make a great crowd as soon as it is light , and at that time a-year rather before daylight ; that is to say , crimps and the masters of coal-ships , whom they call collier-masters ; and , secondly , fishmongers , fish-sellers , and buyers of fish . It was the first of these people that he had his eye upon . So he gives me my orders , which was thus : “ Go you , ” says he , “ into all the alehouses as we go along , and observe where any people are telling of money ; and when you find any , come and tell me. ” So he stood at the door , and I went into the houses . As the collier-masters generally sell their coals at the gate , as they call it , so they generally receive their money in those alehouses ; and it was not long before I brought him word of several . Upon this he went in and made his observations , but found nothing to his purpose . At length I brought him word that there was a man in such a house who had received a great deal of money of somebody , I believed of several people , and that it lay all upon the table in heaps , and he was very busy writing down the sums and putting it up in several bags . “ Is he ? ” says he ; “ I ’ ll warrant him I will have some of it ; ” and in he goes . He walks up and down the house , which had several open tables and boxes in it , and he listened to hear , if he could , what the man ’ s name was ; and he heard somebody call him Cullum , or some such name . Then he watches his opportunity , and steps up to him , and tells him a long story , that there was two gentlemen at the Gun tavern sent him to inquire for him , and to tell him they desired to speak with him . The collier-master had his money lay before him , just as I had told him , and had two or three small payments of money , which he had put up in little black dirty bags , and lay by themselves ; and as it was hardly broad day , he found means in delivering his message to lay his hands upon one of those bags , and carry it off perfectly undiscovered . When we had got it he came out to me , who stood but at the door , and pulling me by the sleeve , “ Run , Jacque , ” says he , “ for our lives ; ” and away he scours , and I after him , never resting , or scarce looking about me , till we got quite up into Fenchurch Street , through Lime Street into Leadenhall Street , down St. Mary Axe to London Wall , then through Bishopsgate Street and down Old Bedlam into Moorfields . By this time we were neither of us able to run very fast ; nor need we have gone so far , for I never found that anybody pursued us . When we got into Moorfields and began to take breath , I asked him what it was frighted him so . “ Fright me , you fool ! ” says he ; “ I have got a devilish great bag of money. ” “ A bag ! ” said I . “ Ay , ay , ” said he ; “ let us get out into the fields where nobody can see us , and I ’ ll show it you. ” So away he had me through Long Alley , and cross Hog Lane and Holloway Lane , into the middle of the great field , which since that has been called the Farthing Pie-House Fields . There we would have sat down , but it was all full of water ; so we went on , crossed the road at Anniseed Cleer , and went into the field where now the great hospital stands ; and finding a by-place , we sat down , and he pulls out the bag . “ Thou art a lucky boy , Jacque , ” says he ; “ thou deservest a good share of this job , truly ; for it is all along of thy lucky news. ” So he pours it all out into my hat ; for , as I told you , I now wore a hat . How he did to whip away such a bag of money from any man that was awake and in his senses I can not tell ; but there was a great deal in it , and among it a paperful by itself . When the paper dropped out of the bag , “ Hold , ” says he , “ that is gold ! ” and began to crow and hollow like a mad boy . But there he was baulked ; for it was a paper of old thirteenpence-halfpenny pieces , half and quarter pieces , with ninepences and fourpence-halfpennies—all old crooked money , Scotch and Irish coin ; so he was disappointed in that . But as it was there was about £17 or £18 in the bag , as I understood by him ; for I could not tell money , not I . Well , he parted this money into three ; that is to say , into three shares—two for himself and one for me , and asked if I was content . I told him yes , I had reason to be contented . Besides , it was so much money added to that I had left of his former adventure that I knew not what to do with it , or with myself , while I had so much about me . This was a most exquisite fellow for a thief ; for he had the greatest dexterity at conveying anything away that he scarce ever pitched upon anything in his eye but he carried it off with his hands , and never that I know of missed his aim or was caught in the fact . He was an eminent pickpocket , and very dexterous at ladies ’ gold watches ; but he generally pushed higher at such desperate things as these ; and he came off the cleanest and with the greatest success imaginable ; and it was in these kinds of the wicked art of thieving that I became his scholar . As we were now so rich , he would not let me lie any longer in the glass-house , or go naked and ragged as I had done , but obliged me to buy two shirts , a waistcoat , and a greatcoat ; for a greatcoat was more for our purpose in the business we was upon than any other . So I clothed myself as he directed , and he took me a lodging in the same house with him , and we lodged together in a little garret fit for our quality . Soon after this we walked out again , and then we tried our fortune in the places by the Exchange a second time . Here we began to act separately , and I undertook to walk by myself ; and the first thing I did accurately was a trick I played that argued some skill for a new beginner ; for I had never seen any business of that kind done before . I saw two gentlemen mighty eager in talk , and one pulled out a pocket-book two or three times , and then slipt it into his coat-pocket again , and then out it came again , and papers were taken out and others were put in ; and then in it went again , and so several times ; the man being still warmly engaged with another man , and two or three others standing hard by them . The last time he put his pocket-book into his pocket , he might be said to throw it in rather than put it in with his hand , and the book lay end-way , resting upon some other book or something else in his pocket ; so that it did not go quite down , but one corner of it was seen above his pocket . This careless way of men putting their pocket-books into a coat-pocket , which is so easily dived into by the least boy that has been used to the trade , can never be too much blamed . The gentlemen are in great hurries , their heads and thoughts entirely taken up , and it is impossible they should be guarded enough against such little hawk ’ s-eyed creatures as we were ; and , therefore , they ought either never to put their pocket-books up at all , or to put them up more secure , or to put nothing of value into them . I happened to be just opposite to this gentleman in that they call Swithin ’ s Alley , or that alley rather which is between Swithin ’ s Alley and the Exchange , just by a passage that goes out of the alley into the Exchange , when , seeing the book pass and repass into the pocket and out of the pocket as above , it came immediately into my head , certainly I might get that pocket-book out if I were nimble , and I warrant Will would have it , if he saw it go and come to and again as I did . But when I saw it hang by the way , as I have said , “ Now it is mine , ” said I to myself , and , crossing the alley , I brushed smoothly but closely by the man , with my hand down flat to my own side , and , taking hold of it by the corner that appeared , the book came so light into my hand , it was impossible the gentleman should feel the least motion , or anybody else see me take it away . I went directly forward into the broad place on the north side of the Exchange , then scoured down Bartholomew Lane , so into Tokenhouse Yard , into the alleys which pass through from thence to London Wall , so through Moorgate , and sat down on the grass in the second of the quarters of Moorfields , towards the middle field ; which was the place that Will and I had appointed to meet at if either of us got any booty . When I came thither Will was not come ; but I saw him coming in about half-an-hour . As soon as Will came to me I asked him what booty he had gotten . He looked pale , and , as I thought , frighted ; but he returned , “ I have got nothing , not I ; but , you lucky young dog , ” says he , “ what have you got ? Have not you got the gentleman ’ s pocket-book in Swithin ’ s Alley ? ” “ Yes , ” says I , and laughed at him ; “ why , how did you know it ? ” “ Know it ! ” says he . “ Why , the gentleman is raving and half distracted ; he stamps and cries and tears his very clothes . He says he is utterly undone and ruined , and the folks in the alley say there is I know not how many thousand pounds in it . What can be in it ? ” says Will . “ Come , let us see. ” Well , we lay close in the grass in the middle of the quarter , so that nobody minded us ; and so we opened the pocket-book , and there was a great many bills and notes under men ’ s hands ; some goldsmiths ’ , and some belonging to insurance offices , as they call them , and the like . But that which was , it seems , worth all the rest was that , in one of the folds of the cover of the book , where there was a case with several partitions , there was a paper full of loose diamonds . The man , as we understood afterward , was a Jew , who dealt in such goods , and who indeed ought to have taken more care of the keeping of them . Now was this booty too great , even for Will himself , to manage ; for though by this time I was come to understand things better than I did formerly , when I knew not what belonged to money , yet Will was better skilled by far in those things than I . But this puzzled him too , as well as me . Now were we something like the cock in the fable ; for all these bills , and I think there was one bill of Sir Henry Furness ’ s for £1200 , and all these diamonds , which were worth about £150 , as they said—I say , all these things were of no value to us : one little purse of gold would have been better to us than all of it . “ But come , ” says Will , “ let us look over the bills for a little one. ” We looked over all the bills , and among them we found a bill under a man ’ s hand for £32 . “ Come , ” says Will , “ let us go and inquire where this man lives. ” So he went into the City again , and Will went to the post-house , and asked there . They told him he lived at Temple Bar . “ Well , ” says Will , “ I will venture . I ’ ll go and receive the money ; it may be he has not remembered to send to stop the payment there. ” But it came into his thoughts to take another course . “ Come , ” says Will , “ I ’ ll go back to the alley , and see if I can hear anything of what has happened , for I believe the hurry is not over yet. ” It seems the man who lost the book was carried into the King ’ s Head tavern at the end of that alley , and a great crowd was about the door . Away goes Will , and watches and waits about the place ; and then , seeing several people together , for they were not all dispersed , he asks one or two what was the matter . They tell him a long story of a gentleman who had lost his pocket-book , with a great bag of diamonds in it , and bills for a great many thousand pounds , and I know not what ; and that they had been just crying it , and had offered £100 reward to any one who would discover and restore it . “ I wish , ” said he to one of them that parleyed with him , “ I did but know who has it ; I don ’ t doubt but I could help him to it again . Does he remember nothing of anybody , boy or fellow , that was near him ? If he could but describe him , it might do. ” Somebody that overheard him was so forward to assist the poor gentleman that they went up and let him know what a young fellow , meaning Will , had been talking at the door ; and down comes another gentleman from him , and , taking Will aside , asked him what he had said about it . Will was a grave sort of a young man , that , though he was an old soldier at the trade , had yet nothing of it in his countenance ; and he answered that he was concerned in business where a great many of the gangs of little pickpockets haunted , and if he had but the least description of the person they suspected , he durst say he could find him out , and might perhaps get the things again for him . Upon this he desired him to go up with him to the gentleman , which he did accordingly ; and there , he said , he sat leaning his head back to the chair , pale as a cloth , disconsolate to a strange degree , and , as Will described him , just like one under a sentence . When they came to ask him whether he had seen no boy or shabby fellow lurking near where he stood , or passing , or repassing , and the like , he answered , “ No , not any. ” Neither could he remember that anybody had come near him . “ Then , ” said Will , “ it will be very hard , if not impossible , to find them out . However , ” said Will , “ if you think it worth while , I will put myself among those rogues , though , ” says he , “ I care not for being seen among them . But I will put in among them , and if it be in any of those gangs , it is ten to one but I shall hear something of it. ” They asked him then if he had heard what terms the gentleman had offered to have it restored ; he answered , “ No ” ( though he had been told at the door ) . They answered , he had offered £100 . “ That is too much , ” says Will ; “ but if you please to leave it to me , I shall either get it for you for less than that , or not be able to get it for you at all. ” Then the losing gentleman said to one of the other , “ Tell him that if he can get it lower , the overplus shall be to himself. ” William said he would be very glad to do the gentleman such a service , and would leave the reward to himself . “ Well , young man , ” says one of the gentlemen , “ whatever you appoint to the young artist that has done this roguery ( for I warrant he is an artist , let it be who it will ) , he shall be paid , if it be within the £100 , and the gentleman is willing to give you £50 besides for your pains. ” “ Truly , sir , ” says Will very gravely , “ it was by mere chance that , coming by the door , and seeing the crowd , I asked what the matter was . But if I should be instrumental to get the unfortunate gentleman his pocket-book and the things in it again , I shall be very glad ; nor am I so rich neither , sir , but £50 is very well worth my while too. ” Then he took directions who to come to , and who to give his account to if he learned anything , and the like . Will stayed so long that , as he and I agreed , I went home , and he did not come to me till night ; for we had considered before that it would not be proper to come from them directly to me , lest they should follow him and apprehend me . If he had made no advances towards a treaty , he would have come back in half-an-hour , as we agreed ; but staying late , we met at our night rendezvous , which was in Rosemary Lane . When he came he gave an account of all the discourse , and particularly what a consternation the gentleman was in who lost the pocket-book , and that he did not doubt but we should get a good round sum for the recovery of it . We consulted all the evening about it , and concluded he should let them hear nothing of them the next day at all ; and that the third day he should go , but should make no discovery ; only that he had got a scent of it , and that he believed he should have it , and make it appear as difficult as possible , and to start as many objections as he could . Accordingly , the third day after he met with the gentleman , who , he found , had been uneasy at his long stay , and told him they were afraid that he only flattered them to get from them , and that they had been too easy in letting him go without a further examination . He took upon him to be very grave with them , and told them that if that was what he was like to have for being so free as to tell them he thought he might serve them , they might see that they had wronged him , and were mistaken by his coming again to them ; that if they thought they could do any thing by examining him , they might go about it , if they pleased , now ; that all he had to say to them was , that he knew where some of the young rogues haunted who were famous for such things ; and that by some inquiries , offering them money , and the like , he believed they would be brought to betray one another , and that so he might pick it out for them ; and this he would say before a justice of peace , if they thought fit ; and then all that he had to say further to them was to tell them he had lost a day or two in their service , and had got nothing but to be suspected for his pains , and that after that he had done , and they might seek their goods where they could find them . They began to listen a little upon that , and asked him if he could give them any hopes of recovering their loss . He told them that he was not afraid to tell them that he believed he had heard some news of them , and that what he had done had prevented all the bills being burnt , book and all ; but that now he ought not to be asked any more questions till they should be pleased to answer him a question or two . They told him they would give him any satisfaction they could , and bid him tell what he desired . “ Why , sir , ” says he , “ how can you expect any thief that had robbed you to such a considerable value as this would come and put himself into your hands , confess he had your goods , and restore them to you , if you do not give them assurance that you will not only give them the reward you agreed to , but also give assurance that they shall not be stopped , questioned , or called to account before a magistrate ? ” They said they would give all possible assurance of it . “ Nay , ” says he , “ I do not know what assurance you are able to give ; for when a poor fellow is in your clutches and has shown you your goods , you may seize upon him for a thief , and it is plain he must be so . Then you go , take away your goods , send him to prison , and what amends can he have of you afterward ? ” They were entirely confounded with the difficulty ; they asked him to try if he could get the things into his hands , and they would pay him the money before he let them go out of his hand , and he should go away half-an-hour before they went out of the room . “ No , gentlemen , ” says he , “ that won ’ t do now . If you had talked so before you had talked of apprehending me for nothing , I should have taken your words ; but now it is plain you have had such a thought in your heads , and how can I , or any one else , be assured of safety ? ” Well , they thought of a great many particulars , but nothing would do . At length the other people who were present put in , that they should give security to him , by a bond of £1000 , that they would not give the person any trouble whatsoever . He pretended they could not be bound , nor could their obligation be of any value , and that their own goods being once seen , they might seize them . “ And what would it signify , ” said he , “ to put a poor pick pocket to sue for his reward ? ” They could not tell what to say , but told him that he should take the things of the boy , if it was a boy , and they would be bound to pay him the money promised . He laughed at them , and said , “ No , gentlemen ; as I am not the thief , so I shall be very loth to put myself in the thief ’ s stead and lie at your mercy. ” They told him they knew not what to do then , and that it would be very hard he would not trust them at all . He said he was very willing to trust them and to serve them , but that it would be very hard to be ruined and charged with the theft for endeavouring to serve them . They then offered to give it him under their hands that they did not in the least suspect him ; that they would never charge him with anything about it ; that they acknowledged he went about to inquire after the goods at their request ; and that if he produced them , they would pay him so much money , at or before the delivery of them , without obliging him to name or produce that person he had them from . Upon this writing , signed by three gentlemen who were present , and by the person in particular who lost the things , the young gentleman told them he would go and do his utmost to get the pocket-book and all that was in it . Then he desired that they would in writing , beforehand , give him a particular of all the several things that were in the book , that he might not have it said , when he produced it , that there was not all ; and he would have the said writing sealed up , and he would make the book be sealed up when it was given to him . This they agreed to ; and the gentleman accordingly drew up a particular of all the bills that he remembered , as he said , was in the book , and also of the diamonds , as follows : — One bill under Sir Henry Furness ’ s hand for £1200 . One bill under Sir Charles Duncomb ’ s hand for £800 , £250 endorsed off = £550 . One bill under the hand of J. Tassel , goldsmith , £165 . One bill of Sir Francis Child , £39 . One bill of one Stewart , that kept a wager-office and insurance , £350 . A paper containing thirty-seven loose diamonds , value about £250 . A little paper containing three large rough diamonds , and one large one polished and cut , value £185 . For all these things they promised , first , to give him whatever he agreed with the thief to give him , not exceeding £50 , and to give him £50 more for himself for procuring them . Now he had his cue , and now he came to me , and told me honestly the whole story as above . So I delivered him the book , and he told me that he thought it was reasonable we should not take the full sum , because he would seem to have done them some service , and so make them the easier . All this I agreed to ; so he went the next day to the place , and the gentlemen met him very punctually . He told them at the first word he had done their work , and , as he hoped , to their mind ; and told them , if it had not been for the diamonds , he could have got all for £10 ; but that the diamonds had shone so bright in the boy ’ s imagination that he talked of running away to France or Holland , and living there all his days like a gentleman ; at which they laughed . “ However , gentlemen , ” said he , “ here is the book ; ” and so pulled it out , wrapt up in a dirty piece of a coloured handkerchief , as black as the street could make it , and sealed with a piece of sorry wax , and the impression of a farthing for a seal . Upon this , the note being also unsealed , at the same time he pulled open the dirty rag , and showed the gentleman his pocket-book ; at which he was so over-surprised with joy , notwithstanding all the preparatory discourse , that he was fain to call for a glass of wine or brandy to drink , to keep him from fainting . The book being opened , the paper of diamonds was first taken out , and there they were every one ; only the little paper was by itself ; and the rough diamonds that were in it were loose among the rest , but he owned they were all there safe . Then the bills were called over one by one , and they found one bill for £80 more than the account mentioned , besides several papers which were not for money , though of consequence to the gentleman ; and he acknowledged that all was very honestly returned . “ And now , young man , ” said they , “ you shall see we will deal as honestly by you ; ” and so , in the first place , they gave him £50 for himself , and then they told out the £50 for me . He took the £50 for himself , and put it up in his pocket , wrapping it in paper , it being all in gold ; then he began to tell over the other £50 . But when he had told out £30 , “ Hold , gentlemen , ” said he , “ as I have acted fairly for you , so you shall have no reason to say I do not do so to the end . I have taken £30 , and for so much I agreed with the boy ; and so there is £20 of your money again. ” They stood looking one at another a good while , as surprised at the honesty of it ; for till that time they were not quite without a secret suspicion that he was the thief ; but that piece of policy cleared up his reputation to them . The gentleman that had got his bills said softly to one of them , “ Give it him all. ” But the other said ( softly too ) , “ No , no ; as long as he has got it abated , and is satisfied with the £50 you have given him , ’ tis very well ; let it go as it ’ tis. ” This was not spoke so softly but he heard it , and said , “ No , ” too ; “ I am very well satisfied ; I am glad I have got them for you ; ” and so they began to part . But just before they were going away one of the gentlemen said to him , “ Young man , come , you see we are just to you , and have done fairly , as you have also ; and we will not desire you to tell us who this cunning fellow is that got such a prize from this gentleman ; but as you have talked with him , prithee , can you tell us nothing of how he did it , that we may beware of such sparks again ? ” “ Sir , ” says Will , “ when I shall tell you what they say , and how the particular case stood , the gentleman would blame himself more than anybody else , or as much at least . The young rogue that catched this prize was out , it seems , with a comrade , who is a nimble , experienced pickpocket as most in London ; but at that time the artist was somewhere at a distance , and this boy never had picked a pocket in his life before ; but he says he stood over against the passage into the Exchange , on the east side , and the gentleman stood just by the passage ; that he was very earnest in talking with some other gentleman , and often pulled out this book and opened it , and took papers out and put others in , and returned it into his coat-pocket ; that the last time it hitched at the pocket-hole , or stopt at something that was in the pocket , and hung a little out , which the boy , who had watched it a good while perceiving , he passes by close to the gentleman , and carried it smoothly off , without the gentleman ’ s perceiving it at all. ” He went on , and said , “ ’ Tis very strange gentlemen should put pocket-books which have such things in them into those loose pockets , and in so careless a manner. ” “ That ’ s very true , ” says the gentleman ; and so , with some other discourse of no great signification , he came away to me . We were now so rich that we scarce knew what to do with our money ; at least I did not , for I had no relations , no friends , nowhere to put anything I had but in my pocket . As for Will , he had a poor mother , but wicked as himself , and he made her rich and glad with his good success . We divided this booty equally ; for though the gaining it was mine , yet the improving of it was his , and his management brought the money ; for neither he or I could have made anything proportionable of the thing any other way . As for the bills , there was no room to doubt but unless they had been carried that minute to the goldsmith ’ s for the money , he would have come with notice to stop the payment , and perhaps have come while the money was receiving , and have taken hold of the person . And then as to the diamonds , there had been no offering them to sale by us poor boys to anybody but those who were our known receivers , and they would have given us nothing for them compared to what they were worth ; for , as I understood afterwards , those who made a trade of buying stolen goods took care to have false weights , and cheat the poor devil that stole them at least an ounce in three . Upon the whole , we made the best of it many ways besides . I had a strange kind of uninstructed conscience at that time ; for though I made no scruple of getting anything in this manner from anybody , yet I could not bear destroying their bills and papers , which were things that would do them a great deal of hurt , and do me no good ; and I was so tormented about it that I could not rest night or day while I made the people easy from whom the things were taken . I was now rich , so rich that I knew not what to do with my money or with myself . I had lived so near and so close , that although , as I said , I did now and then lay out twopence or threepence for mere hunger , yet I had so many people who , as I said , employed me , and who gave me victuals and sometimes clothes , that in a whole year I had not quite spent the 15s . which I had saved of the custom-house gentleman ’ s money ; and I had the four guineas which was of the first booty before that still in my pocket—I mean the money that I let fall into the tree . But now I began to look higher ; and though Will and I went abroad several times together , yet , when small things offered , as handkerchiefs and such trifles , we would not meddle with them , not caring to run the risk for small matters . It fell out one day that , as we were strolling about in West Smithfield on a Friday , there happened to be an ancient country gentleman in the market , selling some very large bullocks . It seems they came out of Sussex , for we heard him say there were no such bullocks in the whole county of Suffolk . His worship , for so they called him , had received the money for these bullocks at a tavern , whose sign I forget now , and having some of it in a bag , and the bag in his hand , he was taken with a sudden fit of coughing , and stands to cough , resting his hand with the bag of money in it upon the bulk-head of a shop just by the Cloister Gate in Smithfield ; that is to say , within three or four doors of it . We were both just behind him . Says Will to me , “ Stand ready. ” Upon this he makes an artificial stumble , and falls with his head just against the old gentleman in the very moment when he was coughing , ready to be strangled , and quite spent for want of breath . The violence of the blow beat the old gentleman quite down . The bag of money did not immediately fly out of his hand , but I ran to get hold of it , and gave it a quick snatch , pulled it clean away , and ran like the wind down the Cloisters with it ; turned on the left hand , as soon as I was through , and cut into Little Britain , so into Bartholomew Close , then across Aldersgate Street , through Paul ’ s Alley into Redcross Street , and so across all the streets , through innumerable alleys , and never stopped till I got into the second quarter of Moorfields , our old agreed rendezvous . Will , in the meantime , fell down with the old gentleman , but soon got up . The old knight , for such , it seems , he was , was frighted with the fall , and his breath so stopped with his cough that he could not recover himself to speak till some time ; during which nimble Will was got up again , and walked off . Nor could he call out , “ Stop thief , ” or tell anybody he had lost anything for a good while ; but , coughing vehemently and looking red , till he was almost black in the face , he cried , “ The ro—hegh , hegh , hegh—the rogues—hegh—have got—hegh , hegh , hegh , hegh , hegh , hegh ; ” then he would get a little breath , and at it again : “ The rogues—hegh , hegh ; ” and , after a great many heghs and rogues , he brought it out— “ have got away my bag of money ! ” All this while the people understood nothing of the matter ; and as for the rogues indeed , they had time enough to get clear away , and in about an hour Will came to the rendezvous . There we sat down in the grass again , and turned out the money , which proved to be eight guineas , and £5 , 12s . in silver , so that it made just £14 together . This we shared upon the spot , and went to work the same day for more ; but whether it was that , being flushed with our success , we were not so vigilant , or that no other opportunity offered , I know not , but we got nothing more that night , nor so much as anything offered itself for an attempt . We took many walks of this kind , sometimes together , at a little distance from one another , and several small hits we made ; but we were so flushed with our success that truly we were above meddling with trifles , as I said before—no , not such things that others would have been glad of ; nothing but pocket-books , letter-cases , or sums of money would move us . The next adventure was in the dusk of the evening , in a court which goes out of Gracechurch Street into Lombard Street , where the Quakers ’ meeting house is . There was a young fellow who , as we learned afterward , was a woollen-draper ’ s apprentice in Gracechurch Street . It seems he had been receiving a sum of money which was very considerable , and he comes to a goldsmith ’ s shop in Lombard Street with it ; paid in the most of it there ; insomuch that it grew dark , and the goldsmith began to be shutting in shop , and candles to be lighted . We watched him in there , and stood on the other side of the way to see what he did . When he had paid in all the money he intended , he stayed still some time longer , to take notes , as I supposed , for what he had paid ; and by this time it was still darker than before . At last he comes out of the shop , with still a pretty large bag under his arm , and walks over into the court , which was then very dark . In the middle of the court is a boarded entry , and farther , at the end of it , a threshold ; and as soon as he had set his foot over the threshold , he was to turn on his left hand into Gracechurch Street . “ Keep up , ” says Will to me ; “ be nimble ; ” and as soon as he had said so he flies at the young man , and gives him such a violent thrust that pushed him forward with too great a force for him to stand ; and as he strove to recover , the threshold took his feet , and he fell forward into the other part of the court , as if he had flown in the air , with his head lying towards the Quakers ’ meeting-house . I stood ready , and presently felt out the bag of money , which I heard fall ; for it flew out of his hand , he having his life to save , not his money . I went forward with the money , and Will , that threw him down , finding I had it , run backward , and as I made along Fenchurch Street , Will overtook me , and we scoured home together . The poor young man was hurt a little with the fall , and reported to his master , as we heard afterward , that he was knocked down , which was not true , for neither Will or I had any stick in our hands ; but the master of the youth was , it seems , so very thankful that his young man was not knocked down before he paid the rest of the money ( which was above £100 more ) to the goldsmith , who was Sir John Sweetapple , that he made no great noise at the loss he had , and , as we heard afterward , only warned his apprentice to be more careful and come no more through such places in the dark ; whereas the man had really no such deliverance as he imagined , for we saw him before , when he had all the money about him ; but it was no time of day for such work as we had to do , so that he was in no danger before . This booty amounted to £29 , 16s. , which was £14 18s . apiece , and added exceedingly to my store , which began now to be very much too big for my management ; and indeed I began to be now full of care for the preservation of what I had got . I wanted a trusty friend to commit it to ; but where was such a one to be found by a poor boy bred up among thieves ? If I should have let any honest body know that I had so much money , they would have asked me how I came by it , and would have been afraid to take it into their hands , lest I being some time or other catched in my rogueries , they should be counted the receivers of stolen goods and the encouragers",Colonel Jacque

VOLUME I CHAPTER I Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ’ s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection . Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse ’ s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ’ s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own . The real evils , indeed , of Emma ’ s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her . Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married . It was Miss Taylor ’ s loss which first brought grief . It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The wedding over , and the bride-people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost . The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ’ s work for her . The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day . She recalled her past kindness—the kindness , the affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ’ s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well-informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . How was she to bear the change ? —It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful . The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time . Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again . Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals . The Woodhouses were first in consequence there . All looked up to them . She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . His spirits required support . He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind . Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ’ s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield . Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , “ Poor Miss Taylor ! —I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! ” “ I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ; —and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? ” “ A house of her own ! —But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours , my dear. ” “ How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us ! —We shall be always meeting ! _We_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon. ” “ My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far. ” “ No , papa , nobody thought of your walking . We must go in the carriage , to be sure. ” “ The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ; —and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? ” “ They are to be put into Mr. Weston ’ s stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ’ s being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her—James is so obliged to you ! ” “ I am very glad I did think of her . It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty-spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are. ” Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own . The backgammon-table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary . Mr. Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ’ s husband . He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London . He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ’ absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square . It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time . Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after “ poor Isabella ” and her children were answered most satisfactorily . When this was over , Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed , “ It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk. ” “ Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire. ” “ But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold. ” “ Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them. ” “ Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding. ” “ By the bye—I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? ” “ Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ’ Tis a sad business. ” “ Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ‘ poor Miss Taylor. ’ I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence ! —At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two. ” “ Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! ” said Emma playfully . “ That is what you have in your head , I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by. ” “ I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , ” said Mr. Woodhouse , with a sigh . “ I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome. ” “ My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _you_ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know—in a joke—it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another. ” Mr. Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . “ Emma knows I never flatter her , ” said Mr. Knightley , “ but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer. ” “ Well , ” said Emma , willing to let it pass— “ you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day. ” “ Dear Emma bears every thing so well , ” said her father . “ But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for. ” Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles . “ It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , ” said Mr. Knightley . “ We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ’ s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ’ s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married. ” “ And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , ” said Emma , “ and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing. ” Mr. Knightley shook his head at her . Her father fondly replied , “ Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches. ” “ I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know ! —Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr. Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful—Mr . Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . Oh no ! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again . Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it . “ Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell ’ s , I made up my mind on the subject . I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that I shall leave off match-making. ” “ I do not understand what you mean by ‘ success , ’ ” said Mr. Knightley . “ Success supposes endeavour . Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . A worthy employment for a young lady ’ s mind ! But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ‘ I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? Where is your merit ? What are you proud of ? You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said. ” “ And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ? —I pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . There is always some talent in it . And as to my poor word ‘ success , ’ which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it . You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and the do-all . If I had not promoted Mr. Weston ’ s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that. ” “ A straightforward , open-hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference. ” “ Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , ” rejoined Mr. Woodhouse , understanding but in part . “ But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one ’ s family circle grievously. ” “ Only one more , papa ; only for Mr. Elton . Poor Mr. Elton ! You like Mr. Elton , papa , —I must look about for a wife for him . There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! I think very well of Mr. Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service. ” “ Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him . But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . That will be a much better thing . I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him. ” “ With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , ” said Mr. Knightley , laughing , “ and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it , a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself. ” CHAPTER II Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied . Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ’ s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe . Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ’ marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ’ s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease . Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . He had , by that time , realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for—enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it . He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ’ s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age . It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ’ s assistance . His father had no apprehension of it . The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston ’ s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear . He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too . He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . Now , upon his father ’ s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place . There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates , or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit . Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion . For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received . “ I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston ? I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . Mr. Woodhouse told me of it . Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life. ” It was , indeed , a highly prized letter . Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ’ s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ’ s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston ’ s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction—her more than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘ poor Miss Taylor , ’ when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse ’ s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , “ Ah , poor Miss Taylor ! She would be very glad to stay. ” There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse . The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding-cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ’ s eating it . He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry , the apothecary , on the subject . Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse ’ s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many—perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . With such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone . There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston ’ s wedding-cake in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it . CHAPTER III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner-parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such . Not unfrequently , through Emma ’ s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him . Real , long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse ’ s drawing-room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away . After these came a second set ; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses . Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance . Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good-will . It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders . She loved every body , was interested in every body ’ s happiness , quicksighted to every body ’ s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a real , honest , old-fashioned Boarding-school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies . Mrs. Goddard ’ s school was in high repute—and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse ’ s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy-work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ’ s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston . She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs. Goddard ’ s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder . This was all that was generally known of her history . She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired . She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ’ s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging—not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell—very creditably , she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them—but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _She_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers . She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper-table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse ’ s feelings were in sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self-approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : “ Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see—one of our small eggs will not hurt you . Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit . Ours are all apple-tarts . You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . I do not advise the custard . Mrs. Goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ? A _small_ half-glass , put into a tumbler of water ? I do not think it could disagree with you. ” Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions . Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last ! CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith ’ s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing . Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . In that respect Mrs. Weston ’ s loss had been important . Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs. Weston ’ s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs . Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ’ s being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required . Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question . Two such could never be granted . Two such she did not want . It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing . Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell . She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain . Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth . Harriet had no penetration . She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm , it must have been the whole . But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . Emma encouraged her talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin ’ s having “ _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard ’ s drawing-room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs. Martin ’ s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea : —a very handsome summer-house , large enough to hold a dozen people. ” For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ’ s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it . Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging . He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging . He had his shepherd ’ s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her . She was very fond of singing . He could sing a little himself . She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . She believed every body spoke well of him . His mother and sisters were very fond of him . Mrs. Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it , ) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband . Not that she _wanted_ him to marry . She was in no hurry at all . “ Well done , Mrs. Martin ! ” thought Emma . “ You know what you are about. ” “ And when she had come away , Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen . Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her. ” “ Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? He does not read ? ” “ Oh yes ! —that is , no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of . He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself . But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining . And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield . He never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The Children of the Abbey . He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can. ” The next question was— “ What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin ? ” “ Oh ! not handsome—not at all handsome . I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now . One does not , you know , after a time . But did you never see him ? He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston . He has passed you very often. ” “ That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do . A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it. ” “ To be sure . Oh yes ! It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight. ” “ I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . What do you imagine his age to be ? ” “ He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ’ s difference—which is very odd. ” “ Only four-and-twenty . That is too young to settle . His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable. ” “ Six years hence ! Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! ” “ Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . Mr. Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make— can not be at all beforehand with the world . Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet. ” “ To be sure , so it is . But they live very comfortably . They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year. ” “ I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ; —I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ’ s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you. ” “ Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are . But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do. ” “ You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse . I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer ’ s daughter , without education. ” “ To be sure . Yes . Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education—and been very well brought up . However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it. ” Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love . The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ’ s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road . He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin . His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ’ s inclination . Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ’ s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . “ Only think of our happening to meet him ! —How very odd ! It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls . He did not think we ever walked this road . He thought we walked towards Randalls most days . He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet . He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to-morrow . So very odd we should happen to meet ! Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? What do you think of him ? Do you think him so very plain ? ” “ He is very plain , undoubtedly—remarkably plain : —but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility. ” “ To be sure , ” said Harriet , in a mortified voice , “ he is not so genteel as real gentlemen. ” “ I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin . At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . Do not you begin to feel that now ? Were not you struck ? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here. ” “ Certainly , he is not like Mr. Knightley . He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the difference plain enough . But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man ! ” “ Mr . Knightley ’ s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _him_ . You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley . But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_ . Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . You must see the difference. ” “ Oh yes ! —there is a great difference . But Mr. Weston is almost an old man . Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty. ” “ Which makes his good manners the more valuable . The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . What is passable in youth is detestable in later age . Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston ’ s time of life ? ” “ There is no saying , indeed , ” replied Harriet rather solemnly . “ But there may be pretty good guessing . He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss. ” “ Will he , indeed ? That will be very bad. ” “ How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else—which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_. ” “ I wonder he did not remember the book ” —was all Harriet ’ s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time . Her next beginning was , “ In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton ’ s manners are superior to Mr. Knightley ’ s or Mr. Weston ’ s . They have more gentleness . They might be more safely held up as a pattern . There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to be copied . Neither would Mr. Knightley ’ s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model . Mr. Elton is good-humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you . Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ? ” She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable . Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ’ s head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ’ s coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . Mr. Elton ’ s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet . He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured , well-meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ’ s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with : —but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ’ s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton ’ s admiration . CHAPTER V “ I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , ” said Mr. Knightley , “ of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing. ” “ A bad thing ! Do you really think it a bad thing ? —why so ? ” “ I think they will neither of them do the other any good. ” “ You surprize me ! Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel ! —Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley. ” “ Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle. ” “ Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma ’ s friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know. ” “ Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists they were—very well chosen , and very neatly arranged—sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma . She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not. ” “ I dare say , ” replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , “ that I thought so _then_ ; —but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma ’ s omitting to do any thing I wished. ” “ There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ , ” —said Mr. Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done . “ But I , ” he soon added , “ who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . She inherits her mother ’ s talents , and must have been under subjection to her. ” “ I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse ’ s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held. ” “ Yes , ” said he , smiling . “ You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield . You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor. ” “ Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston. ” “ Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne . We will not despair , however . Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him. ” “ I hope not _that_.—It is not likely . No , Mr. Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter. ” “ Not I , indeed . I only name possibilities . I do not pretend to Emma ’ s genius for foretelling and guessing . I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune.—But Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith . I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have . She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing . She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . Her ignorance is hourly flattery . How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ can not gain by the acquaintance . Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . I am much mistaken if Emma ’ s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—They only give a little polish. ” “ I either depend more upon Emma ’ s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance . How well she looked last night ! ” “ Oh ! you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ? Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma ’ s being pretty. ” “ Pretty ! say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether—face and figure ? ” “ I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . But I am a partial old friend. ” “ Such an eye ! —the true hazle eye—and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion ! oh ! what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ‘ the picture of health ; ’ now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . Mr. Knightley , is not she ? ” “ I have not a fault to find with her person , ” he replied . “ I think her all you describe . I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain . Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . Mrs. Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm. ” “ And I , Mr. Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . With all dear Emma ’ s little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times. ” “ Very well ; I will not plague you any more . Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . I am sure of having their opinions with me. ” “ I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ’ s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ’ s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office. ” “ Not at all , ” cried he ; “ I am much obliged to you for it . It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to. ” “ Mrs . John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister. ” “ Be satisfied , ” said he , “ I will not raise any outcry . I will keep my ill-humour to myself . I have a very sincere interest in Emma . Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great . There is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for Emma . I wonder what will become of her ! ” “ So do I , ” said Mrs. Weston gently , “ very much. ” “ She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home. ” “ There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , ” said Mrs. Weston , “ as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse ’ s account . I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you. ” Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston ’ s on the subject , as much as possible . There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ’ s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to “ What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? ” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ’ s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton ’ s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ’ s side , as there could be any occasion for . She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton ’ s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . She had no scruple with regard to him . He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ’ s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . “ You have given Miss Smith all that she required , ” said he ; “ you have made her graceful and easy . She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature. ” “ I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . I have done very little. ” “ If it were admissible to contradict a lady , ” said the gallant Mr. Elton— “ I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before. ” “ Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand ! ” “ Great has been the pleasure , I am sure . I never met with a disposition more truly amiable. ” “ I have no doubt of it. ” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ’ s picture . “ Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ? ” said she : “ did you ever sit for your picture ? ” Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naïveté , “ Oh ! dear , no , never. ” No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , “ What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be such a delight to have her picture ! ” “ Let me entreat you , ” cried Mr. Elton ; “ it would indeed be a delight ! Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . I know what your drawings are . How could you suppose me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room , at Randalls ? ” Yes , good man ! —thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? You know nothing of drawing . Don ’ t pretend to be in raptures about mine . Keep your raptures for Harriet ’ s face . “ Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do . Harriet ’ s features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch. ” “ Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I have not a doubt of your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession. ” “ But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit . She thinks so little of her own beauty . Did not you observe her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant , ‘ why should my picture be drawn ? ’ ” “ Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me . But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded. ” Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half-lengths , whole-lengths , pencil , crayon , and water-colours had been all tried in turn . She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . She played and sang ; —and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of . She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . They were both in ecstasies . A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ’ s performances must be capital . “ No great variety of faces for you , ” said Emma . “ I had only my own family to study from . There is my father—another of my father—but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see . Dear Mrs. Weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever I asked her . There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure ! —and the face not unlike . I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children ; —there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ’ s children ever were . Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . He had nestled down his head most conveniently . That ’ s very like . I am rather proud of little George . The corner of the sofa is very good . Then here is my last , ” —unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole-length— “ my last and my best—my brother , Mr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness . I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it— ( Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like ) —only too handsome—too flattering—but that was a fault on the right side ” —after all this , came poor dear Isabella ’ s cold approbation of— “ Yes , it was a little like—but to be sure it did not do him justice . We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ; —and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But for Harriet ’ s sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , I will break my resolution now. ” Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , “ No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so . No husbands and wives , ” with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer . She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . It was to be a whole-length in water-colours , like Mr. John Knightley ’ s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere . It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . “ If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ’ s. ” Mr. Elton was only too happy . Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace . She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ’ s sketch to wish to go on . There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton ’ s very promising attachment was likely to add . Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . “ By all means . We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party. ” The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy . Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . “ Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted , ” —observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.— “ The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . It is the fault of her face that she has them not. ” “ Do you think so ? ” replied he . “ I can not agree with you . It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . I never saw such a likeness in my life . We must allow for the effect of shade , you know. ” “ You have made her too tall , Emma , ” said Mr. Knightley . Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , “ Oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . Consider , she is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short gives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved , you know . Proportions , fore-shortening.—Oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith ’ s . Exactly so indeed ! ” “ It is very pretty , ” said Mr. Woodhouse . “ So prettily done ! Just as your drawings always are , my dear . I do not know any body who draws so well as you do . The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold. ” “ But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer . Look at the tree. ” “ But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear. ” “ You , sir , may say any thing , ” cried Mr. Elton , “ but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! Any other situation would have been much less in character . The naïveté of Miss Smith ’ s manners—and altogether—Oh , it is most admirable ! I can not keep my eyes from it . I never saw such a likeness. ” The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December . But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed . His gallantry was always on the alert . “ Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! he could ride to London at any time . It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand. ” “ He was too good ! —she could not endure the thought ! —she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world , ” —brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances , —and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . “ What a precious deposit ! ” said he with a tender sigh , as he received it . “ This man is almost too gallant to be in love , ” thought Emma . “ I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ‘ Exactly so , ’ as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal . I come in for a pretty good share as a second . But it is his gratitude on Harriet ’ s account. ” CHAPTER VII The very day of Mr. Elton ’ s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ’ s services towards her friend . Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . Half a minute brought it all out . She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard ’ s , that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . “ Who could have thought it ? She was so surprized she did not know what to do . Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . And he wrote as if he really loved her very much—but she did not know—and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.— ” Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . “ Upon my word , ” she cried , “ the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . He will connect himself well if he can. ” “ Will you read the letter ? ” cried Harriet . “ Pray do . II ’ d rather you would. ” Emma was not sorry to be pressed . She read , and was surprized . The style of the letter was much above her expectation . There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a “ Well , well , ” and was at last forced to add , “ Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? ” “ Yes , indeed , a very good letter , ” replied Emma rather slowly— “ so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him . I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . It is so with some men . Yes , I understand the sort of mind . Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected. ” “ Well , ” said the still waiting Harriet ; — “ well—and—and what shall I do ? ” “ What shall you do ! In what respect ? Do you mean with regard to this letter ? ” “ Yes. ” “ But what are you in doubt of ? You must answer it of course—and speedily. ” “ Yes . But what shall I say ? Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me. ” “ Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment. ” “ You think I ought to refuse him then , ” said Harriet , looking down . “ Ought to refuse him ! My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are you in any doubt as to that ? I thought—but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake . I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer . I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it. ” Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : “ You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect. ” “ No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean—What shall I do ? What would you advise me to do ? Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do. ” “ I shall not give you any advice , Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it . This is a point which you must settle with your feelings. ” “ I had no notion that he liked me so very much , ” said Harriet , contemplating the letter . For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , “ I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ‘ Yes , ’ she ought to say ‘ No ’ directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you. ” “ Oh ! no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would just advise me what I had best do—No , no , I do not mean that—As you say , one ’ s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say ‘ No , ’ perhaps.—Do you think I had better say ‘ No ? ’ ” “ Not for the world , ” said Emma , smiling graciously , “ would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? You blush , Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . At this moment whom are you thinking of ? ” The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said— “ Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin . Do you think I am right ? ” “ Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this . It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin . While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey-Mill Farm . Now I am secure of you for ever. ” Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . “ You could not have visited me ! ” she cried , looking aghast . “ No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful ! —What an escape ! —Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world. ” “ Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . I must have given you up. ” “ Dear me ! —How should I ever have borne it ! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more ! ” “ Dear affectionate creature ! —_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm ! —_You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . He must have a pretty good opinion of himself. ” “ I do not think he is conceited either , in general , ” said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; “ at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable . However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration. ” “ Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . We will not be parted . A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter. ” “ Oh no ; —and it is but a short letter too. ” Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a “ very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter. ” “ Oh ! yes , very . Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . I am quite determined to refuse him . But how shall I do ? What shall I say ? ” Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . The business was finished , and Harriet safe . She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton . “ I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again , ” was said in rather a sorrowful tone . “ Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet . You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill. ” “ And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield. ” Some time afterwards it was , “ I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . I am sure Miss Nash would—for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen-draper. ” “ One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet . I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves. ” Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin . “ Now he has got my letter , ” said she softly . “ I wonder what they are all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much. ” “ Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , ” cried Emma . “ At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name. ” “ My picture ! —But he has left my picture in Bond-street. ” “ Has he so ! —Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton . No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow . It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are ! ” Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger . CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night . For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard ’ s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose . Mr. Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . “ Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma ’ s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can . I treat you without ceremony , Mr. Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people. ” “ My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me. ” “ I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . Emma will be happy to entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns—my winter walk. ” “ You can not do better , sir. ” “ I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr. Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey. ” “ Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better . I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you. ” Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before . “ I can not rate her beauty as you do , ” said he ; “ but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman. ” “ I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting. ” “ Come , ” said he , “ you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her . You have cured her of her school-girl ’ s giggle ; she really does you credit. ” “ Thank you . I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . _You_ do not often overpower me with it. ” “ You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? ” “ Almost every moment . She has been gone longer already than she intended. ” “ Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps. ” “ Highbury gossips ! —Tiresome wretches ! ” “ Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would. ” Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . He presently added , with a smile , “ I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage. ” “ Indeed ! how so ? of what sort ? ” “ A very serious sort , I assure you ; ” still smiling . “ Very serious ! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her ? Who makes you their confidant ? ” Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton ’ s having dropt a hint . Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him . “ I have reason to think , ” he replied , “ that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter : —Robert Martin is the man . Her visit to Abbey-Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business . He is desperately in love and means to marry her. ” “ He is very obliging , ” said Emma ; “ but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ? ” “ Well , well , means to make her an offer then . Will that do ? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . I was very much pleased with all that he said . I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin . He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother . I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better . I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last . Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard ’ s to-day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch. ” “ Pray , Mr. Knightley , ” said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , “ how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ? ” “ Certainly , ” replied he , surprized , “ I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ? ” “ Come , ” said she , “ I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday—that is , he wrote , and was refused. ” This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , “ Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? ” “ Oh ! to be sure , ” cried Emma , “ it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her. ” “ Nonsense ! a man does not imagine any such thing . But what is the meaning of this ? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ? madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken. ” “ I saw her answer ! —nothing could be clearer. ” “ You saw her answer ! —you wrote her answer too . Emma , this is your doing . You persuaded her to refuse him. ” “ And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong . Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet ’ s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples . It is a pity that they were ever got over. ” “ Not Harriet ’ s equal ! ” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , “ No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . What are Harriet Smith ’ s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school . She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck . Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ’ s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ‘ Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match. ’ ” “ I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing . What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend ! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair . You are not just to Harriet ’ s claims . They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a degradation. ” “ A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman-farmer ! ” “ As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.—That she is a gentleman ’ s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ’ s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin. ” “ Whoever might be her parents , ” said Mr. Knightley , “ whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard ’ s hands to shift as she can ; —to move , in short , in Mrs. Goddard ’ s line , to have Mrs. Goddard ’ s acquaintance . Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . She had no sense of superiority then . If she has it now , you have given it . You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma . Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know . Depend upon it he had encouragement. ” It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . “ You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet . Harriet ’ s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good-natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good-nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess. ” “ Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do. ” “ To be sure ! ” cried she playfully . “ I know _that_ is the feeling of you all . I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . Oh ! Harriet may pick and chuse . Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you . And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? No—pray let her have time to look about her. ” “ I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , ” said Mr. Knightley presently , “ though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard ’ s all the rest of her life—or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing-master ’ s son. ” “ We think so very differently on this point , Mr. Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it . We shall only be making each other more angry . But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application . She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now . I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey-Mill , find him disagreeable . But the case is altered now . She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet. ” “ Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked ! ” cried Mr. Knightley.— “ Robert Martin ’ s manners have sense , sincerity , and good-humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand. ” Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ’ s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . He was thinking . The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . “ Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does . Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ; —and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain. ” Emma laughed and disclaimed . He continued , “ Depend upon it , Elton will not do . Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . He knows the value of a good income as well as any body . Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ’ s . He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece. ” “ I am very much obliged to you , ” said Emma , laughing again . “ If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton ’ s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself . I have done with match-making indeed . I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls . I shall leave off while I am well. ” “ Good morning to you , ” —said he , rising and walking off abruptly . He was very much vexed . He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly . Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ’ s , than in his . She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ’ s wrong , as Mr. Knightley . He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her . She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives . Harriet ’ s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man ’ s coming to Mrs. Goddard ’ s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ’ s friendship and woman ’ s feelings would not justify . He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley ’ s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton . Harriet ’ s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight . Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard ’ s to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist-club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , “ that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness. ” CHAPTER IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself . He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . She was sorry , but could not repent . On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton ’ s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet ’ s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin ’ s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend ’ s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to-morrow . It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ’ s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . Miss Nash , head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard ’ s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ’ s help , to get a great many more . Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity . Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . “ So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time. ” And it always ended in “ Kitty , a fair but frozen maid. ” His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter . It was by no means his daughter ’ s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition . Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well-known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin ’ d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.— made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . “ Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr. Elton ? ” said she ; “ that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you. ” “ Oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . The stupidest fellow ! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse ” —he stopt a moment— “ or Miss Smith could inspire him. ” The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . “ I do not offer it for Miss Smith ’ s collection , ” said he . “ Being my friend ’ s , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it. ” The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand . There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ’ s . He was gone the next moment : —after another moment ’ s pause , “ Take it , ” said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet— “ it is for you . Take your own. ” But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . To Miss—— CHARADE . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! But ah ! united , what reverse we have ! Man ’ s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye ! She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , “ Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed . I have read worse charades . _Courtship_—a very good hint . I give you credit for it . This is feeling your way . This is saying very plainly— ‘ Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance. ’ May its approval beam in that soft eye ! Harriet exactly . Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets , the justest that could be given . Thy ready wit the word will soon supply . Humph—Harriet ’ s ready wit ! All the better . A man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so . Ah ! Mr. Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you . For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken . An excellent charade indeed ! and very much to the purpose . Things must come to a crisis soon now. ” She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ’ s wondering questions . “ What can it be , Miss Woodhouse ? —what can it be ? I have not an idea—I can not guess it in the least . What can it possibly be ? Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse . Do help me . I never saw any thing so hard . Is it kingdom ? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young lady . Do you think it is a good one ? Can it be woman ? And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . Can it be Neptune ? Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! Or a trident ? or a mermaid ? or a shark ? Oh , no ! shark is only one syllable . It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ? ” “ Mermaids and sharks ! Nonsense ! My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? Give me the paper and listen . For Miss ——— , read Miss Smith . My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . That is _court_ . Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! That is _ship_ ; —plain as it can be.—Now for the cream . But ah ! united , ( _courtship_ , you know , ) what reverse we have ! Man ’ s boasted power and freedom , all are flown . Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . A very proper compliment ! —and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you can not find much difficulty in comprehending . Read it in comfort to yourself . There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you. ” Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak . But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel . Emma spoke for her . “ There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , ” said she , “ that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton ’ s intentions . You are his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . I thought it must be so . I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened . I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want—consideration , independence , a proper home—it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us. ” “ Dear Miss Woodhouse ! ” —and “ Dear Miss Woodhouse , ” was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . Mr. Elton ’ s superiority had very ample acknowledgment . “ Whatever you say is always right , ” cried Harriet , “ and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it . It is so much beyond any thing I deserve . Mr. Elton , who might marry any body ! There can not be two opinions about _him_ . He is so very superior . Only think of those sweet verses— ‘ To Miss ———. ’ Dear me , how clever ! —Could it really be meant for me ? ” “ I can not make a question , or listen to a question about that . It is a certainty . Receive it on my judgment . It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose. ” “ It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself ! —The strangest things do take place ! ” “ When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls . There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow . The course of true love never did run smooth— A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage. ” “ That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me , —me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas ! And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr. Knightley ! His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . And so excellent in the Church ! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury . Dear me ! When I look back to the first time I saw him ! How little did I think ! —The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good-natured . And how beautiful we thought he looked ! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole. ” “ This is an alliance which , whoever—whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools . If they are anxious to see you _happily_ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it ; —if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _well_ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them. ” “ Yes , very true . How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you . You understand every thing . You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade ! —If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it. ” “ I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday. ” “ I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read. ” “ I never read one more to the purpose , certainly. ” “ It is as long again as almost all we have had before. ” “ I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . Such things in general can not be too short. ” Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . “ It is one thing , ” said she , presently—her cheeks in a glow— “ to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this. ” Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin ’ s prose . “ Such sweet lines ! ” continued Harriet— “ these two last ! —But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out ? —Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ? ” “ Leave it to me . You do nothing . He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . Trust to me. ” “ Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book ! I am sure I have not got one half so good. ” “ Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book. ” “ Oh ! but those two lines are ” — — “ The best of all . Granted ; —for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them . The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection . Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion . A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither . Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you. ” Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . “ I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , ” said she . “ Very well , ” replied Emma ; “ a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him . It will be giving him so much pleasure ! He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all ! —You must let me read it to him. ” Harriet looked grave . “ My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . Do not let us be too solemn on the business . He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade. ” “ Oh ! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it . Do as you please. ” Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “ Well , my dears , how does your book go on ? —Have you got any thing fresh ? ” “ Yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh . A piece of paper was found on the table this morning— ( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy ) —containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in. ” She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . “ Aye , that ’ s very just , indeed , that ’ s very properly said . Very true . ‘ Woman , lovely woman. ’ It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma. ” Emma only nodded , and smiled.—After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , “ Ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things ! If I had but her memory ! But I can remember nothing ; —not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several . Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood-wink ’ d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before . And that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all the way through . But I think , my dear , you said you had got it. ” “ Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page . We copied it from the Elegant Extracts . It was Garrick ’ s , you know. ” “ Aye , very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it . Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama . I hope we shall have her here next week . Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her—and what room there will be for the children ? ” “ Oh ! yes—she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ; —and there is the nursery for the children , —just as usual , you know . Why should there be any change ? ” “ I do not know , my dear—but it is so long since she was here ! —not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.—Mr . John Knightley ’ s being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella ! —she is sadly taken away from us all ! —and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! ” “ She will not be surprized , papa",Emma
Charles Dickens,"The Period It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to Heaven , we were all going direct the other way -- in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only . There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face , on the throne of England ; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face , on the throne of France . In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes , that things in general were settled for ever . It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five . Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period , as at this . Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday , of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster . Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years , after rapping out its messages , as the spirits of this very year last past ( supernaturally deficient in originality ) rapped out theirs . Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People , from a congress of British subjects in America : which , strange to relate , have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood . France , less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident , rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill , making paper money and spending it . Under the guidance of her Christian pastors , she entertained herself , besides , with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off , his tongue torn out with pincers , and his body burned alive , because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view , at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards . It is likely enough that , rooted in the woods of France and Norway , there were growing trees , when that sufferer was put to death , already marked by the Woodman , Fate , to come down and be sawn into boards , to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it , terrible in history . It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris , there were sheltered from the weather that very day , rude carts , bespattered with rustic mire , snuffed about by pigs , and roosted in by poultry , which the Farmer , Death , had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution . But that Woodman and that Farmer , though they work unceasingly , work silently , and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread : the rather , forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake , was to be atheistical and traitorous . In England , there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting . Daring burglaries by armed men , and highway robberies , took place in the capital itself every night ; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers ’ warehouses for security ; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light , and , being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “ the Captain , ” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away ; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers , and the guard shot three dead , and then got shot dead himself by the other four , “ in consequence of the failure of his ammunition : ” after which the mail was robbed in peace ; that magnificent potentate , the Lord Mayor of London , was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green , by one highwayman , who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue ; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys , and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them , loaded with rounds of shot and ball ; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms ; musketeers went into St. Giles ’ s , to search for contraband goods , and the mob fired on the musketeers , and the musketeers fired on the mob , and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way . In the midst of them , the hangman , ever busy and ever worse than useless , was in constant requisition ; now , stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals ; now , hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday ; now , burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen , and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall ; to-day , taking the life of an atrocious murderer , and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer ’ s boy of sixpence . All these things , and a thousand like them , came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five . Environed by them , while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded , those two of the large jaws , and those other two of the plain and the fair faces , trod with stir enough , and carried their divine rights with a high hand . Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses , and myriads of small creatures -- the creatures of this chronicle among the rest -- along the roads that lay before them . CHAPTER II . The Mail It was the Dover road that lay , on a Friday night late in November , before the first of the persons with whom this history has business . The Dover road lay , as to him , beyond the Dover mail , as it lumbered up Shooter ’ s Hill . He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail , as the rest of the passengers did ; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise , under the circumstances , but because the hill , and the harness , and the mud , and the mail , were all so heavy , that the horses had three times already come to a stop , besides once drawing the coach across the road , with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath . Reins and whip and coachman and guard , however , in combination , had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument , that some brute animals are endued with Reason ; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty . With drooping heads and tremulous tails , they mashed their way through the thick mud , floundering and stumbling between whiles , as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints . As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand , with a wary “ Wo-ho ! so-ho-then ! ” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it -- like an unusually emphatic horse , denying that the coach could be got up the hill . Whenever the leader made this rattle , the passenger started , as a nervous passenger might , and was disturbed in mind . There was a steaming mist in all the hollows , and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill , like an evil spirit , seeking rest and finding none . A clammy and intensely cold mist , it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another , as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do . It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings , and a few yards of road ; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it , as if they had made it all . Two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail . All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears , and wore jack-boots . Not one of the three could have said , from anything he saw , what either of the other two was like ; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind , as from the eyes of the body , of his two companions . In those days , travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice , for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers . As to the latter , when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “ the Captain ’ s ” pay , ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript , it was the likeliest thing upon the cards . So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself , that Friday night in November , one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , lumbering up Shooter ’ s Hill , as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail , beating his feet , and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him , where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols , deposited on a substratum of cutlass . The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers , the passengers suspected one another and the guard , they all suspected everybody else , and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses ; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey . “ Wo-ho ! ” said the coachman . “ So , then ! One more pull and you ’ re at the top and be damned to you , for I have had trouble enough to get you to it ! -- Joe ! ” “ Halloa ! ” the guard replied . “ What o ’ clock do you make it , Joe ? ” “ Ten minutes , good , past eleven. ” “ My blood ! ” ejaculated the vexed coachman , “ and not atop of Shooter ’ s yet ! Tst ! Yah ! Get on with you ! ” The emphatic horse , cut short by the whip in a most decided negative , made a decided scramble for it , and the three other horses followed suit . Once more , the Dover mail struggled on , with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side . They had stopped when the coach stopped , and they kept close company with it . If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness , he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman . The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill . The horses stopped to breathe again , and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent , and open the coach-door to let the passengers in . “ Tst ! Joe ! ” cried the coachman in a warning voice , looking down from his box . “ What do you say , Tom ? ” They both listened . “ I say a horse at a canter coming up , Joe. ” “ _I_ say a horse at a gallop , Tom , ” returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place . “ Gentlemen ! In the king ’ s name , all of you ! ” With this hurried adjuration , he cocked his blunderbuss , and stood on the offensive . The passenger booked by this history , was on the coach-step , getting in ; the two other passengers were close behind him , and about to follow . He remained on the step , half in the coach and half out of ; they remained in the road below him . They all looked from the coachman to the guard , and from the guard to the coachman , and listened . The coachman looked back and the guard looked back , and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back , without contradicting . The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach , added to the stillness of the night , made it very quiet indeed . The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach , as if it were in a state of agitation . The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard ; but at any rate , the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath , and holding the breath , and having the pulses quickened by expectation . The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill . “ So-ho ! ” the guard sang out , as loud as he could roar . “ Yo there ! Stand ! I shall fire ! ” The pace was suddenly checked , and , with much splashing and floundering , a man ’ s voice called from the mist , “ Is that the Dover mail ? ” “ Never you mind what it is ! ” the guard retorted . “ What are you ? ” “ _Is_ that the Dover mail ? ” “ Why do you want to know ? ” “ I want a passenger , if it is. ” “ What passenger ? ” “ Mr . Jarvis Lorry. ” Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name . The guard , the coachman , and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully . “ Keep where you are , ” the guard called to the voice in the mist , “ because , if I should make a mistake , it could never be set right in your lifetime . Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight. ” “ What is the matter ? ” asked the passenger , then , with mildly quavering speech . “ Who wants me ? Is it Jerry ? ” ( “ I don ’ t like Jerry ’ s voice , if it is Jerry , ” growled the guard to himself . “ He ’ s hoarser than suits me , is Jerry. ” ) “ Yes , Mr. Lorry. ” “ What is the matter ? ” “ A despatch sent after you from over yonder . T. and Co. ” “ I know this messenger , guard , ” said Mr. Lorry , getting down into the road -- assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers , who immediately scrambled into the coach , shut the door , and pulled up the window . “ He may come close ; there ’ s nothing wrong. ” “ I hope there ain ’ t , but I can ’ t make so ‘ Nation sure of that , ” said the guard , in gruff soliloquy . “ Hallo you ! ” “ Well ! And hallo you ! ” said Jerry , more hoarsely than before . “ Come on at a footpace ! d ’ ye mind me ? And if you ’ ve got holsters to that saddle o ’ yourn , don ’ t let me see your hand go nigh ’ em . For I ’ m a devil at a quick mistake , and when I make one it takes the form of Lead . So now let ’ s look at you. ” The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist , and came to the side of the mail , where the passenger stood . The rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper . The rider ’ s horse was blown , and both horse and rider were covered with mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man . “ Guard ! ” said the passenger , in a tone of quiet business confidence . The watchful guard , with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss , his left at the barrel , and his eye on the horseman , answered curtly , “ Sir. ” “ There is nothing to apprehend . I belong to Tellson ’ s Bank . You must know Tellson ’ s Bank in London . I am going to Paris on business . A crown to drink . I may read this ? ” “ If so be as you ’ re quick , sir. ” He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side , and read -- first to himself and then aloud : “ ‘ Wait at Dover for Mam ’ selle. ’ It ’ s not long , you see , guard . Jerry , say that my answer was , RECALLED TO LIFE. ” Jerry started in his saddle . “ That ’ s a Blazing strange answer , too , ” said he , at his hoarsest . “ Take that message back , and they will know that I received this , as well as if I wrote . Make the best of your way . Good night. ” With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in ; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers , who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots , and were now making a general pretence of being asleep . With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action . The coach lumbered on again , with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent . The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest , and , having looked to the rest of its contents , and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt , looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat , in which there were a few smith ’ s tools , a couple of torches , and a tinder-box . For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out , which did occasionally happen , he had only to shut himself up inside , keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw , and get a light with tolerable safety and ease ( if he were lucky ) in five minutes . “ Tom ! ” softly over the coach roof . “ Hallo , Joe. ” “ Did you hear the message ? ” “ I did , Joe. ” “ What did you make of it , Tom ? ” “ Nothing at all , Joe. ” “ That ’ s a coincidence , too , ” the guard mused , “ for I made the same of it myself. ” Jerry , left alone in the mist and darkness , dismounted meanwhile , not only to ease his spent horse , but to wipe the mud from his face , and shake the wet out of his hat-brim , which might be capable of holding about half a gallon . After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm , until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again , he turned to walk down the hill . “ After that there gallop from Temple Bar , old lady , I won ’ t trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level , ” said this hoarse messenger , glancing at his mare . “ ‘ Recalled to life. ’ That ’ s a Blazing strange message . Much of that wouldn ’ t do for you , Jerry ! I say , Jerry ! You ’ d be in a Blazing bad way , if recalling to life was to come into fashion , Jerry ! ” CHAPTER III . The Night Shadows A wonderful fact to reflect upon , that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other . A solemn consideration , when I enter a great city by night , that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret ; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret ; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there , is , in some of its imaginings , a secret to the heart nearest it ! Something of the awfulness , even of Death itself , is referable to this . No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved , and vainly hope in time to read it all . No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water , wherein , as momentary lights glanced into it , I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged . It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring , for ever and for ever , when I had read but a page . It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost , when the light was playing on its surface , and I stood in ignorance on the shore . My friend is dead , my neighbour is dead , my love , the darling of my soul , is dead ; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality , and which I shall carry in mine to my life ’ s end . In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass , is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are , in their innermost personality , to me , or than I am to them ? As to this , his natural and not to be alienated inheritance , the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King , the first Minister of State , or the richest merchant in London . So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach ; they were mysteries to one another , as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six , or his own coach and sixty , with the breadth of a county between him and the next . The messenger rode back at an easy trot , stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink , but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel , and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes . He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration , being of a surface black , with no depth in the colour or form , and much too near together -- as if they were afraid of being found out in something , singly , if they kept too far apart . They had a sinister expression , under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon , and over a great muffler for the chin and throat , which descended nearly to the wearer ’ s knees . When he stopped for drink , he moved this muffler with his left hand , only while he poured his liquor in with his right ; as soon as that was done , he muffled again . “ No , Jerry , no ! ” said the messenger , harping on one theme as he rode . “ It wouldn ’ t do for you , Jerry . Jerry , you honest tradesman , it wouldn ’ t suit _your_ line of business ! Recalled -- ! Bust me if I don ’ t think he ’ d been a drinking ! ” His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain , several times , to take off his hat to scratch his head . Except on the crown , which was raggedly bald , he had stiff , black hair , standing jaggedly all over it , and growing down hill almost to his broad , blunt nose . It was so like Smith ’ s work , so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair , that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him , as the most dangerous man in the world to go over . While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson ’ s Bank , by Temple Bar , who was to deliver it to greater authorities within , the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message , and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness . They seemed to be numerous , for she shied at every shadow on the road . What time , the mail-coach lumbered , jolted , rattled , and bumped upon its tedious way , with its three fellow-inscrutables inside . To whom , likewise , the shadows of the night revealed themselves , in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested . Tellson ’ s Bank had a run upon it in the mail . As the bank passenger -- with an arm drawn through the leathern strap , which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger , and driving him into his corner , whenever the coach got a special jolt -- nodded in his place , with half-shut eyes , the little coach-windows , and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them , and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger , became the bank , and did a great stroke of business . The rattle of the harness was the chink of money , and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson ’ s , with all its foreign and home connection , ever paid in thrice the time . Then the strong-rooms underground , at Tellson ’ s , with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger ( and it was not a little that he knew about them ) , opened before him , and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle , and found them safe , and strong , and sound , and still , just as he had last seen them . But , though the bank was almost always with him , and though the coach ( in a confused way , like the presence of pain under an opiate ) was always with him , there was another current of impression that never ceased to run , all through the night . He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave . Now , which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person , the shadows of the night did not indicate ; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years , and they differed principally in the passions they expressed , and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state . Pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , lamentation , succeeded one another ; so did varieties of sunken cheek , cadaverous colour , emaciated hands and figures . But the face was in the main one face , and every head was prematurely white . A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre : “ Buried how long ? ” The answer was always the same : “ Almost eighteen years. ” “ You had abandoned all hope of being dug out ? ” “ Long ago. ” “ You know that you are recalled to life ? ” “ They tell me so. ” “ I hope you care to live ? ” “ I can ’ t say. ” “ Shall I show her to you ? Will you come and see her ? ” The answers to this question were various and contradictory . Sometimes the broken reply was , “ Wait ! It would kill me if I saw her too soon. ” Sometimes , it was given in a tender rain of tears , and then it was , “ Take me to her. ” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered , and then it was , “ I don ’ t know her . I don ’ t understand. ” After such imaginary discourse , the passenger in his fancy would dig , and dig , dig -- now with a spade , now with a great key , now with his hands -- to dig this wretched creature out . Got out at last , with earth hanging about his face and hair , he would suddenly fan away to dust . The passenger would then start to himself , and lower the window , to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek . Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within . The real Banking-house by Temple Bar , the real business of the past day , the real strong rooms , the real express sent after him , and the real message returned , would all be there . Out of the midst of them , the ghostly face would rise , and he would accost it again . “ Buried how long ? ” “ Almost eighteen years. ” “ I hope you care to live ? ” “ I can ’ t say. ” Dig -- dig -- dig -- until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window , draw his arm securely through the leathern strap , and speculate upon the two slumbering forms , until his mind lost its hold of them , and they again slid away into the bank and the grave . “ Buried how long ? ” “ Almost eighteen years. ” “ You had abandoned all hope of being dug out ? ” “ Long ago. ” The words were still in his hearing as just spoken -- distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life -- when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight , and found that the shadows of the night were gone . He lowered the window , and looked out at the rising sun . There was a ridge of ploughed land , with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked ; beyond , a quiet coppice-wood , in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees . Though the earth was cold and wet , the sky was clear , and the sun rose bright , placid , and beautiful . “ Eighteen years ! ” said the passenger , looking at the sun . “ Gracious Creator of day ! To be buried alive for eighteen years ! ” CHAPTER IV . The Preparation When the mail got successfully to Dover , in the course of the forenoon , the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was . He did it with some flourish of ceremony , for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon . By that time , there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated : for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations . The mildewy inside of the coach , with its damp and dirty straw , its disagreeable smell , and its obscurity , was rather like a larger dog-kennel . Mr. Lorry , the passenger , shaking himself out of it in chains of straw , a tangle of shaggy wrapper , flapping hat , and muddy legs , was rather like a larger sort of dog . “ There will be a packet to Calais , tomorrow , drawer ? ” “ Yes , sir , if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair . The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon , sir . Bed , sir ? ” “ I shall not go to bed till night ; but I want a bedroom , and a barber. ” “ And then breakfast , sir ? Yes , sir . That way , sir , if you please . Show Concord ! Gentleman ’ s valise and hot water to Concord . Pull off gentleman ’ s boots in Concord . ( You will find a fine sea-coal fire , sir . ) Fetch barber to Concord . Stir about there , now , for Concord ! ” The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail , and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot , the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George , that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it , all kinds and varieties of men came out of it . Consequently , another drawer , and two porters , and several maids and the landlady , were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room , when a gentleman of sixty , formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes , pretty well worn , but very well kept , with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets , passed along on his way to his breakfast . The coffee-room had no other occupant , that forenoon , than the gentleman in brown . His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire , and as he sat , with its light shining on him , waiting for the meal , he sat so still , that he might have been sitting for his portrait . Very orderly and methodical he looked , with a hand on each knee , and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat , as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire . He had a good leg , and was a little vain of it , for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close , and were of a fine texture ; his shoes and buckles , too , though plain , were trim . He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig , setting very close to his head : which wig , it is to be presumed , was made of hair , but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass . His linen , though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings , was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach , or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea . A face habitually suppressed and quieted , was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner , in years gone by , some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson ’ s Bank . He had a healthy colour in his cheeks , and his face , though lined , bore few traces of anxiety . But , perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson ’ s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people ; and perhaps second-hand cares , like second-hand clothes , come easily off and on . Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait , Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep . The arrival of his breakfast roused him , and he said to the drawer , as he moved his chair to it : “ I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day . She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry , or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson ’ s Bank . Please to let me know. ” “ Yes , sir . Tellson ’ s Bank in London , sir ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Yes , sir . We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris , sir . A vast deal of travelling , sir , in Tellson and Company ’ s House. ” “ Yes . We are quite a French House , as well as an English one. ” “ Yes , sir . Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself , I think , sir ? ” “ Not of late years . It is fifteen years since we -- since I -- came last from France. ” “ Indeed , sir ? That was before my time here , sir . Before our people ’ s time here , sir . The George was in other hands at that time , sir. ” “ I believe so. ” “ But I would hold a pretty wager , sir , that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing , a matter of fifty , not to speak of fifteen years ago ? ” “ You might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth. ” “ Indeed , sir ! ” Rounding his mouth and both his eyes , as he stepped backward from the table , the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left , dropped into a comfortable attitude , and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank , as from an observatory or watchtower . According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages . When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast , he went out for a stroll on the beach . The little narrow , crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach , and ran its head into the chalk cliffs , like a marine ostrich . The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about , and the sea did what it liked , and what it liked was destruction . It thundered at the town , and thundered at the cliffs , and brought the coast down , madly . The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it , as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea . A little fishing was done in the port , and a quantity of strolling about by night , and looking seaward : particularly at those times when the tide made , and was near flood . Small tradesmen , who did no business whatever , sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes , and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter . As the day declined into the afternoon , and the air , which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen , became again charged with mist and vapour , Mr. Lorry ’ s thoughts seemed to cloud too . When it was dark , and he sat before the coffee-room fire , awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast , his mind was busily digging , digging , digging , in the live red coals . A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm , otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work . Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street , and rumbled into the inn-yard . He set down his glass untouched . “ This is Mam ’ selle ! ” said he . In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London , and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson ’ s . “ So soon ? ” Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road , and required none then , and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson ’ s immediately , if it suited his pleasure and convenience . The gentleman from Tellson ’ s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation , settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears , and follow the waiter to Miss Manette ’ s apartment . It was a large , dark room , furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair , and loaded with heavy dark tables . These had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf ; as if _they_ were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out . The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry , picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet , supposed Miss Manette to be , for the moment , in some adjacent room , until , having got past the two tall candles , he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire , a young lady of not more than seventeen , in a riding-cloak , and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand . As his eyes rested on a short , slight , pretty figure , a quantity of golden hair , a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look , and a forehead with a singular capacity ( remembering how young and smooth it was ) , of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity , or wonder , or alarm , or merely of a bright fixed attention , though it included all the four expressions -- as his eyes rested on these things , a sudden vivid likeness passed before him , of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel , one cold time , when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high . The likeness passed away , like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her , on the frame of which , a hospital procession of negro cupids , several headless and all cripples , were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender -- and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette . “ Pray take a seat , sir. ” In a very clear and pleasant young voice ; a little foreign in its accent , but a very little indeed . “ I kiss your hand , miss , ” said Mr. Lorry , with the manners of an earlier date , as he made his formal bow again , and took his seat . “ I received a letter from the Bank , sir , yesterday , informing me that some intelligence -- or discovery -- ” “ The word is not material , miss ; either word will do. ” “ -- respecting the small property of my poor father , whom I never saw -- so long dead -- ” Mr. Lorry moved in his chair , and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids . As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets ! “ -- rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris , there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank , so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose. ” “ Myself. ” “ As I was prepared to hear , sir. ” She curtseyed to him ( young ladies made curtseys in those days ) , with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she . He made her another bow . “ I replied to the Bank , sir , that as it was considered necessary , by those who know , and who are so kind as to advise me , that I should go to France , and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me , I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself , during the journey , under that worthy gentleman ’ s protection . The gentleman had left London , but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here. ” “ I was happy , ” said Mr. Lorry , “ to be entrusted with the charge . I shall be more happy to execute it. ” “ Sir , I thank you indeed . I thank you very gratefully . It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business , and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature . I have done my best to prepare myself , and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are. ” “ Naturally , ” said Mr. Lorry . “ Yes -- I -- ” After a pause , he added , again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears , “ It is very difficult to begin. ” He did not begin , but , in his indecision , met her glance . The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression -- but it was pretty and characteristic , besides being singular -- and she raised her hand , as if with an involuntary action she caught at , or stayed some passing shadow . “ Are you quite a stranger to me , sir ? ” “ Am I not ? ” Mr. Lorry opened his hands , and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile . Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose , the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be , the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing . He watched her as she mused , and the moment she raised her eyes again , went on : “ In your adopted country , I presume , I can not do better than address you as a young English lady , Miss Manette ? ” “ If you please , sir. ” “ Miss Manette , I am a man of business . I have a business charge to acquit myself of . In your reception of it , don ’ t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine -- truly , I am not much else . I will , with your leave , relate to you , miss , the story of one of our customers. ” “ Story ! ” He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated , when he added , in a hurry , “ Yes , customers ; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers . He was a French gentleman ; a scientific gentleman ; a man of great acquirements -- a Doctor. ” “ Not of Beauvais ? ” “ Why , yes , of Beauvais . Like Monsieur Manette , your father , the gentleman was of Beauvais . Like Monsieur Manette , your father , the gentleman was of repute in Paris . I had the honour of knowing him there . Our relations were business relations , but confidential . I was at that time in our French House , and had been -- oh ! twenty years. ” “ At that time -- I may ask , at what time , sir ? ” “ I speak , miss , of twenty years ago . He married -- an English lady -- and I was one of the trustees . His affairs , like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families , were entirely in Tellson ’ s hands . In a similar way I am , or I have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers . These are mere business relations , miss ; there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment . I have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day ; in short , I have no feelings ; I am a mere machine . To go on -- ” “ But this is my father ’ s story , sir ; and I begin to think ” -- the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him -- “ that when I was left an orphan through my mother ’ s surviving my father only two years , it was you who brought me to England . I am almost sure it was you. ” Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his , and he put it with some ceremony to his lips . He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again , and , holding the chair-back with his left hand , and using his right by turns to rub his chin , pull his wig at the ears , or point what he said , stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his . “ Miss Manette , it _was_ I . And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now , in saying I had no feelings , and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations , when you reflect that I have never seen you since . No ; you have been the ward of Tellson ’ s House since , and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson ’ s House since . Feelings ! I have no time for them , no chance of them . I pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle. ” After this odd description of his daily routine of employment , Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands ( which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before ) , and resumed his former attitude . “ So far , miss ( as you have remarked ) , this is the story of your regretted father . Now comes the difference . If your father had not died when he did -- Don ’ t be frightened ! How you start ! ” She did , indeed , start . And she caught his wrist with both her hands . “ Pray , ” said Mr. Lorry , in a soothing tone , bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble : “ pray control your agitation -- a matter of business . As I was saying -- ” Her look so discomposed him that he stopped , wandered , and began anew : “ As I was saying ; if Monsieur Manette had not died ; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared ; if he had been spirited away ; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place , though no art could trace him ; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper , across the water there ; for instance , the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time ; if his wife had implored the king , the queen , the court , the clergy , for any tidings of him , and all quite in vain ; -- then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman , the Doctor of Beauvais. ” “ I entreat you to tell me more , sir. ” “ I will . I am going to . You can bear it ? ” “ I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment. ” “ You speak collectedly , and you -- _are_ collected . That ’ s good ! ” ( Though his manner was less satisfied than his words . ) “ A matter of business . Regard it as a matter of business -- business that must be done . Now if this doctor ’ s wife , though a lady of great courage and spirit , had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born -- ” “ The little child was a daughter , sir. ” “ A daughter . A-a-matter of business -- don ’ t be distressed . Miss , if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born , that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of , by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead -- No , don ’ t kneel ! In Heaven ’ s name why should you kneel to me ! ” “ For the truth . O dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth ! ” “ A -- a matter of business . You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused ? Let us be clear-headed . If you could kindly mention now , for instance , what nine times ninepence are , or how many shillings in twenty guineas , it would be so encouraging . I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind. ” Without directly answering to this appeal , she sat so still when he had very gently raised her , and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been , that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry . “ That ’ s right , that ’ s right . Courage ! Business ! You have business before you ; useful business . Miss Manette , your mother took this course with you . And when she died -- I believe broken-hearted -- having never slackened her unavailing search for your father , she left you , at two years old , to grow to be blooming , beautiful , and happy , without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison , or wasted there through many lingering years. ” As he said the words he looked down , with an admiring pity , on the flowing golden hair ; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey . “ You know that your parents had no great possession , and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you . There has been no new discovery , of money , or of any other property ; but -- ” He felt his wrist held closer , and he stopped . The expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror . “ But he has been -- been found . He is alive . Greatly changed , it is too probable ; almost a wreck , it is possible ; though we will hope the best . Still , alive . Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris , and we are going there : I , to identify him if I can : you , to restore him to life , love , duty , rest , comfort. ” A shiver ran through her frame , and from it through his . She said , in a low , distinct , awe-stricken voice , as if she were saying it in a dream , “ I am going to see his Ghost ! It will be his Ghost -- not him ! ” Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm . “ There , there , there ! See now , see now ! The best and the worst are known to you , now . You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side. ” She repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , “ I have been free , I have been happy , yet his Ghost has never haunted me ! ” “ Only one thing more , ” said Mr. Lorry , laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention : “ he has been found under another name ; his own , long forgotten or long concealed . It would be worse than useless now to inquire which ; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked , or always designedly held prisoner . It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries , because it would be dangerous . Better not to mention the subject , anywhere or in any way , and to remove him -- for a while at all events -- out of France . Even I , safe as an Englishman , and even Tellson ’ s , important as they are to French credit , avoid all naming of the matter . I carry about me , not a scrap of writing openly referring to it . This is a secret service altogether . My credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , ‘ Recalled to Life ; ’ which may mean anything . But what is the matter ! She doesn ’ t notice a word ! Miss Manette ! ” Perfectly still and silent , and not even fallen back in her chair , she sat under his hand , utterly insensible ; with her eyes open and fixed upon him , and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead . So close was her hold upon his arm , that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her ; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving . A wild-looking woman , whom even in his agitation , Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour , and to have red hair , and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion , and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure , and good measure too , or a great Stilton cheese , came running into the room in advance of the inn servants , and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady , by laying a brawny hand upon his chest , and sending him flying back against the nearest wall . ( “ I really think this must be a man ! ” was Mr. Lorry ’ s breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall . ) “ Why , look at you all ! ” bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants . “ Why don ’ t you go and fetch things , instead of standing there staring at me ? I am not so much to look at , am I ? Why don ’ t you go and fetch things ? I ’ ll let you know , if you don ’ t bring smelling-salts , cold water , and vinegar , quick , I will. ” There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives , and she softly laid the patient on a sofa , and tended her with great skill and gentleness : calling her “ my precious ! ” and “ my bird ! ” and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care . “ And you in brown ! ” she said , indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry ; “ couldn ’ t you tell her what you had to tell her , without frightening her to death ? Look at her , with her pretty pale face and her cold hands . Do you call _that_ being a Banker ? ” Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer , that he could only look on , at a distance , with much feebler sympathy and humility , while the strong woman , having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of “ letting them know ” something not mentioned if they stayed there , staring , recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations , and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder . “ I hope she will do well now , ” said Mr. Lorry . “ No thanks to you in brown , if she does . My darling pretty ! ” “ I hope , ” said Mr. Lorry , after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility , “ that you accompany Miss Manette to France ? ” “ A likely thing , too ! ” replied the strong woman . “ If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water , do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island ? ” This being another question hard to answer , Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it . CHAPTER V. The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken , in the street . The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart ; the cask had tumbled out with a run , the hoops had burst , and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop , shattered like a walnut-shell . All the people within reach had suspended their business , or their idleness , to run to the spot and drink the wine . The rough , irregular stones of the street , pointing every way , and designed , one might have thought , expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them , had dammed it into little pools ; these were surrounded , each by its own jostling group or crowd , according to its size . Some men kneeled down , made scoops of their two hands joined , and sipped , or tried to help women , who bent over their shoulders , to sip , before the wine had all run out between their fingers . Others , men and women , dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware , or even with handkerchiefs from women ’ s heads , which were squeezed dry into infants ’ mouths ; others made small mud-embankments , to stem the wine as it ran ; others , directed by lookers-on up at high windows , darted here and there , to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions ; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask , licking , and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish . There was no drainage to carry off the wine , and not only did it all get taken up , but so much mud got taken up along with it , that there might have been a scavenger in the street , if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence . A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices -- voices of men , women , and children -- resounded in the street while this wine game lasted . There was little roughness in the sport , and much playfulness . There was a special companionship in it , an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one , which led , especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted , to frolicsome embraces , drinking of healths , shaking of hands , and even joining of hands and dancing , a dozen together . When the wine was gone , and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers , these demonstrations ceased , as suddenly as they had broken out . The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting , set it in motion again ; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes , at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes , or in those of her child , returned to it ; men with bare arms , matted locks , and cadaverous faces , who had emerged into the winter light from cellars , moved away , to descend again ; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine . The wine was red wine , and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine , in Paris , where it was spilled . It had stained many hands , too , and many faces , and many naked feet , and many wooden shoes . The hands of the man who sawed the wood , left red marks on the billets ; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby , was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again . Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask , had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth ; and one tall joker so besmirched , his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it , scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees -- BLOOD . The time was to come , when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones , and when the stain of it would be red upon many there . And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine , which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance , the darkness of it was heavy -- cold , dirt , sickness , ignorance , and want , were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence -- nobles of great power all of them ; but , most especially the last . Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill , and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young , shivered at every corner , passed in and out at every doorway , looked from every window , fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook . The mill which had worked them down , was the mill that grinds young people old ; the children had ancient faces and grave voices ; and upon them , and upon the grown faces , and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh , was the sigh , Hunger . It was prevalent everywhere . Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses , in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines ; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper ; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off ; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys , and started up from the filthy street that had no offal , among its refuse , of anything to eat . Hunger was the inscription on the baker ’ s shelves , written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread ; at the sausage-shop , in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale . Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder ; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato , fried with some reluctant drops of oil . Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it . A narrow winding street , full of offence and stench , with other narrow winding streets diverging , all peopled by rags and nightcaps , and all smelling of rags and nightcaps , and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill . In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay . Depressed and slinking though they were , eyes of fire were not wanting among them ; nor compressed lips , white with what they suppressed ; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring , or inflicting . The trade signs ( and they were almost as many as the shops ) were , all , grim illustrations of Want . The butcher and the porkman painted up , only the leanest scrags of meat ; the baker , the coarsest of meagre loaves . The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops , croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer , and were gloweringly confidential together . Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition , save tools and weapons ; but , the cutler ’ s knives and axes were sharp and bright , the smith ’ s hammers were heavy , and the gunmaker ’ s stock was murderous . The crippling stones of the pavement , with their many little reservoirs of mud and water , had no footways , but broke off abruptly at the doors . The kennel , to make amends , ran down the middle of the street -- when it ran at all : which was only after heavy rains , and then it ran , by many eccentric fits , into the houses . Across the streets , at wide intervals , one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley ; at night , when the lamplighter had let these down , and lighted , and hoisted them again , a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead , as if they were at sea . Indeed they were at sea , and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest . For , the time was to come , when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter , in their idleness and hunger , so long , as to conceive the idea of improving on his method , and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys , to flare upon the darkness of their condition . But , the time was not come yet ; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain , for the birds , fine of song and feather , took no warning . The wine-shop was a corner shop , better than most others in its appearance and degree , and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it , in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches , looking on at the struggle for the lost wine . “ It ’ s not my affair , ” said he , with a final shrug of the shoulders . “ The people from the market did it . Let them bring another. ” There , his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke , he called to him across the way : “ Say , then , my Gaspard , what do you do there ? ” The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance , as is often the way with his tribe . It missed its mark , and completely failed , as is often the way with his tribe too . “ What now ? Are you a subject for the mad hospital ? ” said the wine-shop keeper , crossing the road , and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud , picked up for the purpose , and smeared over it . “ Why do you write in the public streets ? Is there -- tell me thou -- is there no other place to write such words in ? ” In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand ( perhaps accidentally , perhaps not ) upon the joker ’ s heart . The joker rapped it with his own , took a nimble spring upward , and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude , with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out . A joker of an extremely , not to say wolfishly practical character , he looked , under those circumstances . “ Put it on , put it on , ” said the other . “ Call wine , wine ; and finish there. ” With that advice , he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker ’ s dress , such as it was -- quite deliberately , as having dirtied the hand on his account ; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop . This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked , martial-looking man of thirty , and he should have been of a hot temperament , for , although it was a bitter day , he wore no coat , but carried one slung over his shoulder . His shirt-sleeves were rolled up , too , and his brown arms were bare to the elbows . Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair . He was a dark man altogether , with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them . Good-humoured looking on the whole , but implacable-looking , too ; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose ; a man not desirable to be met , rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side , for nothing would turn the man . Madame Defarge , his wife , sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in . Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age , with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything , a large hand heavily ringed , a steady face , strong features , and great composure of manner . There was a character about Madame Defarge , from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided . Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold , was wrapped in fur , and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head , though not to the concealment of her large earrings . Her knitting was before her , but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick . Thus engaged , with her right elbow supported by her left hand , Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in , but coughed just one grain of cough . This , in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line , suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers , for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way . The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner . Other company were there : two playing cards , two playing dominoes , three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine . As he passed behind the counter , he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady , “ This is our man. ” “ What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there ? ” said Monsieur Defarge to himself ; “ I don ’ t know you. ” But , he feigned not to notice the two strangers , and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter . “ How goes it , Jacques ? ” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge . “ Is all the spilt wine swallowed ? ” “ Every drop , Jacques , ” answered Monsieur Defarge . When this interchange of Christian name was effected , Madame Defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line . “ It is not often , ” said the second of the three , addressing Monsieur Defarge , “ that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death . Is it not so , Jacques ? ” “ It is so , Jacques , ” Monsieur Defarge returned . At this second interchange of the Christian name , Madame Defarge , still using her toothpick with profound composure , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line . The last of the three now said his say , as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips . “ Ah ! So much the worse ! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , Jacques . Am I right , Jacques ? ” “ You are right , Jacques , ” was the response of Monsieur Defarge . This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by , kept her eyebrows up , and slightly rustled in her seat . “ Hold then ! True ! ” muttered her husband . “ Gentlemen -- my wife ! ” The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge , with three flourishes . She acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look . Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it . “ Gentlemen , ” said her husband , who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her , “ good day . The chamber , furnished bachelor-fashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when I stepped out , is on the fifth floor . The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , ” pointing with his hand , “ near to the window of my establishment . But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way . Gentlemen , adieu ! ” They paid for their wine , and left the place . The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner , and begged the favour of a word . “ Willingly , sir , ” said Monsieur Defarge , and quietly stepped with him to the door . Their conference was very short , but very decided . Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive . It had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out . The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out . Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing . Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette , emerging from the wine-shop thus , joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before . It opened from a stinking little black courtyard , and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses , inhabited by a great number of people . In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips . It was a gentle action , but not at all gently done ; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds . He had no good-humour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left , but had become a secret , angry , dangerous man . “ It is very high ; it is a little difficult . Better to begin slowly. ” Thus , Monsieur Defarge , in a stern voice , to Mr. Lorry , as they began ascending the stairs . “ Is he alone ? ” the latter whispered . “ Alone ! God help him , who should be with him ! ” said the other , in the same low voice . “ Is he always alone , then ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Of his own desire ? ” “ Of his own necessity . As he was , when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him , and , at my peril be discreet -- as he was then , so he is now. ” “ He is greatly changed ? ” “ Changed ! ” The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand , and mutter a tremendous curse . No direct answer could have been half so forcible . Mr. Lorry ’ s spirits grew heavier and heavier , as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher . Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough now ; but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses . Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building -- that is to say , the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase -- left its own heap of refuse on its own landing , besides flinging other refuse from its own windows . The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered , would have polluted the air , even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities ; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable . Through such an atmosphere , by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison , the way lay . Yielding to his own disturbance of mind , and to his young companion ’ s agitation , which became greater every instant , Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest . Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating , by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted , seemed to escape , and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in . Through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood ; and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations . At last , the top of the staircase was gained , and they stopped for the third time . There was yet an upper staircase , of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions , to be ascended , before the garret story was reached . The keeper of the wine-shop , always going a little in advance , and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took , as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady , turned himself about here , and , carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder , took out a key . “ The door is locked then , my friend ? ” said Mr. Lorry , surprised . “ Ay . Yes , ” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge . “ You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired ? ” “ I think it necessary to turn the key. ” Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear , and frowned heavily . “ Why ? ” “ Why ! Because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightened -- rave -- tear himself to pieces -- die -- come to I know not what harm -- if his door was left open. ” “ Is it possible ! ” exclaimed Mr. Lorry . “ Is it possible ! ” repeated Defarge , bitterly . “ Yes . And a beautiful world we live in , when it _is_ possible , and when many other such things are possible , and not only possible , but done -- done , see you ! -- under that sky there , every day . Long live the Devil . Let us go on. ” This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper , that not a word of it had reached the young lady ’ s ears . But , by this time she trembled under such strong emotion , and her face expressed such deep anxiety , and , above all , such dread and terror , that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance . “ Courage , dear miss ! Courage ! Business ! The worst will be over in a moment ; it is but passing the room-door , and the worst is over . Then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin . Let our good friend here , assist you on that side . That ’ s well , friend Defarge . Come , now . Business , business ! ” They went up slowly and softly . The staircase was short , and they were soon at the top . There , as it had an abrupt turn in it , they came all at once in sight of three men , whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door , and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged , through some chinks or holes in the wall . On hearing footsteps close at hand , these three turned , and rose , and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop . “ I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , ” explained Monsieur Defarge . “ Leave us , good boys ; we have business here. ” The three glided by , and went silently down . There appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone , Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : “ Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette ? ” “ I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few. ” “ Is that well ? ” “ _I_ think it is well. ” “ Who are the few ? How do you choose them ? ” “ I choose them as real men , of my name -- Jacques is my name -- to whom the sight is likely to do good . Enough ; you are English ; that is another thing . Stay there , if you please , a little moment. ” With an admonitory gesture to keep them back , he stooped , and looked in through the crevice in the wall . Soon raising his head again , he struck twice or thrice upon the door -- evidently with no other object than to make a noise there . With the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could . The door slowly opened inward under his hand , and he looked into the room and said something . A faint voice answered something . Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side . He looked back over his shoulder , and beckoned them to enter . Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter ’ s waist , and held her ; for he felt that she was sinking . “ A-a-a-business , business ! ” he urged , with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek . “ Come in , come in ! ” “ I am afraid of it , ” she answered , shuddering . “ Of it ? What ? ” “ I mean of him . Of my father. ” Rendered in a manner desperate , by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor , he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder , lifted her a little , and hurried her into the room . He sat her down just within the door , and held her , clinging to him . Defarge drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand . All this he did , methodically , and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make . Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was . He stopped there , and faced round . The garret , built to be a depository for firewood and the like , was dim and dark : for , the window of dormer shape , was in truth a door in the roof , with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street : unglazed , and closing up the middle in two pieces , like any other door of French construction . To exclude the cold , one half of this door was fast closed , and the other was opened but a very little way . Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means , that it was difficult , on first coming in , to see anything ; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one , the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity . Yet , work of that kind was being done in the garret ; for , with his back towards the door , and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him , a white-haired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes . CHAPTER VI . The Shoemaker “ Good day ! ” said Monsieur Defarge , looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking . It was raised for a moment , and a very faint voice responded to the salutation , as if it were at a distance : “ Good day ! ” “ You are still hard at work , I see ? ” After a long silence , the head was lifted for another moment , and the voice replied , “ Yes -- I am working. ” This time , a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner , before the face had dropped again . The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful . It was not the faintness of physical weakness , though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it . Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse . It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago . So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain . So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground . So expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveller , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die . Some minutes of silent work had passed : and the haggard eyes had looked up again : not with any interest or curiosity , but with a dull mechanical perception , beforehand , that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood , was not yet empty . “ I want , ” said Defarge , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , “ to let in a little more light here . You can bear a little more ? ” The shoemaker stopped his work ; looked with a vacant air of listening , at the floor on one side of him ; then similarly , at the floor on the other side of him ; then , upward at the speaker . “ What did you say ? ” “ You can bear a little more light ? ” “ I must bear it , if you let it in. ” ( Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word . ) The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time . A broad ray of light fell into the garret , and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap , pausing in his labour . His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench . He had a white beard , raggedly cut , but not very long , a hollow face , and exceedingly bright eyes . The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large , under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair , though they had been really otherwise ; but , they were naturally large , and looked unnaturally so . His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat , and showed his body to be withered and worn . He , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which . He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light , and the very bones of it seemed transparent . So he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work . He never looked at the figure before him , without first looking down on this side of himself , then on that , as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound ; he never spoke , without first wandering in this manner , and forgetting to speak . “ Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day ? ” asked Defarge , motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward . “ What did you say ? ” “ Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day ? ” “ I can ’ t say that I mean to . I suppose so . I don ’ t know. ” But , the question reminded him of his work , and he bent over it again . Mr. Lorry came silently forward , leaving the daughter by the door . When he had stood , for a minute or two , by the side of Defarge , the shoemaker looked up . He showed no surprise at seeing another figure , but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it ( his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour ) , and then the hand dropped to his work , and he once more bent over the shoe . The look and the action had occupied but an instant . “ You have a visitor , you see , ” said Monsieur Defarge . “ What did you say ? ” “ Here is a visitor. ” The shoemaker looked up as before , but without removing a hand from his work . “ Come ! ” said Defarge . “ Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one . Show him that shoe you are working at . Take it , monsieur. ” Mr. Lorry took it in his hand . “ Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker ’ s name. ” There was a longer pause than usual , before the shoemaker replied : “ I forget what it was you asked me . What did you say ? ” “ I said , couldn ’ t you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur ’ s information ? ” “ It is a lady ’ s shoe . It is a young lady ’ s walking-shoe . It is in the present mode . I never saw the mode . I have had a pattern in my hand. ” He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride . “ And the maker ’ s name ? ” said Defarge . Now that he had no work to hold , he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left , and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right , and then passed a hand across his bearded chin , and so on in regular changes , without a moment ’ s intermission . The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken , was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon , or endeavouring , in the hope of some disclosure , to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man . “ Did you ask me for my name ? ” “ Assuredly I did. ” “ One Hundred and Five , North Tower. ” “ Is that all ? ” “ One Hundred and Five , North Tower. ” With a weary sound that was not a sigh , nor a groan , he bent to work again , until the silence was again broken . “ You are not a shoemaker by trade ? ” said Mr. Lorry , looking steadfastly at him . His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him : but as no help came from that quarter , they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground . “ I am not a shoemaker by trade ? No , I was not a shoemaker by trade . I-I learnt it here . I taught myself . I asked leave to -- ” He lapsed away , even for minutes , ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time . His eyes came slowly back , at last , to the face from which they had wandered ; when they rested on it , he started , and resumed , in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake , reverting to a subject of last night . “ I asked leave to teach myself , and I got it with much difficulty after a long while , and I have made shoes ever since. ” As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him , Mr. Lorry said , still looking steadfastly in his face : “ Monsieur Manette , do you remember nothing of me ? ” The shoe dropped to the ground , and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner . “ Monsieur Manette ” ; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge ’ s arm ; “ do you remember nothing of this man ? Look at him . Look at me . Is there no old banker , no old business , no old servant , no old time , rising in your mind , Monsieur Manette ? ” As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly , by turns , at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge , some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead , gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him . They were overclouded again , they were fainter , they were gone ; but they had been there . And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him , and where she now stood looking at him , with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion , if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him , but which were now extending towards him , trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast , and love it back to life and hope -- so exactly was the expression repeated ( though in stronger characters ) on her fair young face , that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light , from him to her . Darkness had fallen on him in its place . He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way . Finally , with a deep long sigh , he took the shoe up , and resumed his work . “ Have you recognised him , monsieur ? ” asked Defarge in a whisper . “ Yes ; for a moment . At first I thought it quite hopeless , but I have unquestionably seen , for a single moment , the face that I once knew so well . Hush ! Let us draw further back . Hush ! ” She had moved from the wall of the garret , very near to the bench on which he sat . There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour . Not a word was spoken , not a sound was made . She stood , like a spirit , beside him , and he bent over his work . It happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker ’ s knife . It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood . He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress . He raised them , and saw her face . The two spectators started forward , but she stayed them with a motion of her hand . She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife , though they had . He stared at her with a fearful look , and after a while his lips began to form some words , though no sound proceeded from them . By degrees , in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing , he was heard to say : “ What is this ? ” With the tears streaming down her face , she put her two hands to her lips , and kissed them to him ; then clasped them on her breast , as if she laid his ruined head there . “ You are not the gaoler ’ s daughter ? ” She sighed “ No. ” “ Who are you ? ” Not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him . He recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm . A strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame ; he laid the knife down softly , as he sat staring at her . Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck . Advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it . In the midst of the action he went astray , and , with another deep sigh , fell to work at his shoemaking . But not for long . Releasing his arm , she laid her hand upon his shoulder . After looking doubtfully at it , two or three times , as if to be sure that it was really there , he laid down his work , put his hand to his neck , and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it . He opened this , carefully , on his knee , and it contained a very little quantity of hair : not more than one or two long golden hairs , which he had , in some old day , wound off upon his finger . He took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it . “ It is the same . How can it be ! When was it ! How was it ! ” As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too . He turned her full to the light , and looked at her . “ She had laid her head upon my shoulder , that night when I was summoned out -- she had a fear of my going , though I had none -- and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve . ‘ You will leave me them ? They can never help me to escape in the body , though they may in the spirit. ’ Those were the words I said . I remember them very well. ” He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it . But when he did find spoken words for it , they came to him coherently , though slowly . “ How was this ? -- _Was it you_ ? ” Once more , the two spectators started , as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness . But she sat perfectly still in his grasp , and only said , in a low voice , “ I entreat you , good gentlemen , do not come near us , do not speak , do not move ! ” “ Hark ! ” he exclaimed . “ Whose voice was that ? ” His hands released her as he uttered this cry , and went up to his white hair , which they tore in a frenzy . It died out , as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him , and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast ; but he still looked at her , and gloomily shook his head . “ No , no , no ; you are too young , too blooming . It can ’ t be . See what the prisoner is . These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard . No , no . She was -- and He was -- before the slow years of the North Tower -- ages ago . What is your name , my gentle angel ? ” Hailing his softened tone and manner , his daughter fell upon her knees before him , with her appealing hands upon his breast . “ O , sir , at another time you shall know my name , and who my mother was , and who my father , and how I never knew their hard , hard history . But I can not tell you at this time , and I can not tell you here . All that I may tell you , here and now , is , that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me . Kiss me , kiss me ! O my dear , my dear ! ” His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair , which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him . “ If you hear in my voice -- I don ’ t know that it is so , but I hope it is -- if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it ! If you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it ! If , when I hint to you of a Home that is before us , where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it ! ” She held him closer round the neck , and rocked him on her breast like a child . “ If , when I tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that I have come here to take you from it , and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest , I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native France so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it ! And if , when I shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it ! Weep for her , then , and for me ! Good gentlemen , thank God ! I feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart . O , see ! Thank God for us , thank God ! ” He had sunk in her arms , and his face dropped on her breast : a sight so touching , yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it , that the two beholders covered their faces . When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed , and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms -- emblem to humanity , of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last -- they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground . He had gradually dropped to the floor , and lay there in a lethargy , worn out . She had nestled down with him , that his head might lie upon her arm ; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light . “ If , without disturbing him , ” she said , raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them , after repeated blowings of his nose , “ all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once , so that , from the very door , he could be taken away -- ” “ But , consider . Is he fit for the journey ? ” asked Mr. Lorry . “ More fit for that , I think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him. ” “ It is true , ” said Defarge , who was kneeling to look on and hear . “ More than that ; Monsieur Manette is , for all reasons , best out of France . Say , shall I hire a carriage and post-horses ? ” “ That ’ s business , ” said Mr. Lorry , resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners ; “ and if business is to be done , I had better do it. ” “ Then be so kind , ” urged Miss Manette , “ as to leave us here . You see how composed he has become , and you can not be afraid to leave him with me now . Why should you be ? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption , I do not doubt that you will find him , when you come back , as quiet as you leave him . In any case , I will take care of him until you return , and then we will remove him straight. ” Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course , and in favour of one of them remaining . But , as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to , but travelling papers ; and as time pressed , for the day was drawing to an end , it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done , and hurrying away to do it . Then , as the darkness closed in , the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father ’ s side , and watched him . The darkness deepened and deepened , and they both lay quiet , until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall . Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey , and had brought with them , besides travelling cloaks and wrappers , bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee . Monsieur Defarge put this provender , and the lamp he carried , on the shoemaker ’ s bench ( there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed ) , and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive , and assisted him to his feet . No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind , in the scared blank wonder of his face . Whether he knew what had happened , whether he recollected what they had said to him , whether he knew that he was free , were questions which no sagacity could have solved . They tried speaking to him ; but , he was so confused , and so very slow to answer , that they took fright at his bewilderment , and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more . He had a wild , lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands , that had not been seen in him before ; yet , he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter ’ s voice , and invariably turned to it when she spoke . In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion , he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink , and put on the cloak and other wrappings , that they gave him to wear . He readily responded to his daughter ’ s drawing her arm through his , and took -- and kept -- her hand in both his own . They began to descend ; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp , Mr. Lorry closing the little procession . They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the walls . “ You remember the place , my father ? You remember coming up here ? ” “ What did you say ? ” But , before she could repeat the question , he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it . “ Remember ? No , I don ’ t remember . It was so very long ago. ” That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house , was apparent to them . They heard him mutter , “ One Hundred and Five , North Tower ; ” and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him . On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread , as being in expectation of a drawbridge ; and when there was no drawbridge , and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street , he dropped his daughter ’ s hand and clasped his head again . No crowd was about the door ; no people were discernible at any of the many windows ; not even a chance passerby was in the street . An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there . Only one soul was to be seen , and that was Madame Defarge -- who leaned against the door-post , knitting , and saw nothing . The prisoner had got into a coach , and his daughter had followed him , when Mr. Lorry ’ s feet were arrested on the step by his asking , miserably , for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes . Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard . She quickly brought them down and handed them in ; -- and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post , knitting , and saw nothing . Defarge got upon the box , and gave the word “ To the Barrier ! ” The postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps . Under the over-swinging lamps -- swinging ever brighter in the better streets , and ever dimmer in the worse -- and by lighted shops , gay crowds , illuminated coffee-houses , and theatre-doors , to one of the city gates . Soldiers with lanterns , at the guard-house there . “ Your papers , travellers ! ” “ See here then , Monsieur the Officer , ” said Defarge , getting down , and taking him gravely apart , “ these are the papers of monsieur inside , with the white head . They were consigned to me , with him , at the -- ” He dropped his voice , there was a flutter among the military lanterns , and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform , the eyes connected with the arm looked , not an every day or an every night look , at monsieur with the white head . “ It is well . Forward ! ” from the uniform . “ Adieu ! ” from Defarge . And so , under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps , out under the great grove of stars . Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights ; some , so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it , as a point in space where anything is suffered or done : the shadows of the night were broad and black . All through the cold and restless interval , until dawn , they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry -- sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out , and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him , and what were capable of restoration -- the old inquiry : “ I hope you care to be recalled to life ? ” And the old answer : “ I can ’ t say. ” The end of the first book . Book the Second -- the Golden Thread CHAPTER I . Five Years Later Tellson ’ s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty . It was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious . It was an old-fashioned place , moreover , in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness , proud of its darkness , proud of its ugliness , proud of its incommodiousness . They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars , and were fired by an express conviction that , if it were less objectionable , it would be less respectable . This was no passive belief , but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business . Tellson ’ s ( they said ) wanted no elbow-room , Tellson ’ s wanted no light , Tellson ’ s wanted no embellishment . Noakes and Co. ’ s might , or Snooks Brothers ’ might ; but Tellson ’ s , thank Heaven -- ! Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson ’ s . In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country ; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable , but were only the more respectable . Thus it had come to pass , that Tellson ’ s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience . After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat , you fell into Tellson ’ s down two steps , and came to your senses in a miserable little shop , with two little counters , where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it , while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows , which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street , and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper , and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar . If your business necessitated your seeing “ the House , ” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back , where you meditated on a misspent life , until the House came with its hands in its pockets , and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight . Your money came out of , or went into , wormy old wooden drawers , particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut . Your bank-notes had a musty odour , as if they were fast decomposing into rags again . Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools , and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two . Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries , and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air . Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room , that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner , and where , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty , the first letters written to you by your old love , or by your little children , were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows , by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee . But indeed , at that time , putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions , and not least of all with Tellson ’ s . Death is Nature ’ s remedy for all things , and why not Legislation ’ s ? Accordingly , the forger was put to Death ; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death ; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death ; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death ; the holder of a horse at Tellson ’ s door , who made off with it , was put to Death ; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death ; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime , were put to Death . Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention -- it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse -- but , it cleared off ( as to this world ) the trouble of each particular case , and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after . Thus , Tellson ’ s , in its day , like greater places of business , its contemporaries , had taken so many lives , that , if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of , they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had , in a rather significant manner . Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson ’ s , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely . When they took a young man into Tellson ’ s London house , they hid him somewhere till he was old . They kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him . Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment . Outside Tellson ’ s -- never by any means in it , unless called in -- was an odd-job-man , an occasional porter and messenger , who served as the live sign of the house . He was never absent during business hours , unless upon an errand , and then he was represented by his son : a grisly urchin of twelve , who was his express image . People understood that Tellson ’ s , in a stately way , tolerated the odd-job-man . The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity , and time and tide had drifted this person to the post . His surname was Cruncher , and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness , in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch , he had received the added appellation of Jerry . The scene was Mr. Cruncher ’ s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley , Whitefriars : the time , half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning , Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty . ( Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes : apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game , by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it . ) Mr. Cruncher ’ s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood , and were but two in number , even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one . But they were very decently kept . Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread . Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home . At first , he slept heavily , but , by degrees , began to roll and surge in bed , until he rose above the surface , with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons . At which juncture , he exclaimed , in a voice of dire exasperation : “ Bust me , if she ain ’ t at it agin ! ” A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner , with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to . “ What ! ” said Mr. Cruncher , looking out of bed for a boot . “ You ’ re at it agin , are you ? ” After hailing the morn with this second salutation , he threw a boot at the woman as a third . It was a very muddy boot , and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher ’ s domestic economy , that , whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay . “ What , ” said Mr. Cruncher , varying his apostrophe after missing his mark -- “ what are you up to , Aggerawayter ? ” “ I was only saying my prayers. ” “ Saying your prayers ! You ’ re a nice woman ! What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me ? ” “ I was not praying against you ; I was praying for you. ” “ You weren ’ t . And if you were , I won ’ t be took the liberty with . Here ! your mother ’ s a nice woman , young Jerry , going a praying agin your father ’ s prosperity . You ’ ve got a dutiful mother , you have , my son . You ’ ve got a religious mother , you have , my boy : going and flopping herself down , and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child. ” Master Cruncher ( who was in his shirt ) took this very ill , and , turning to his mother , strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board . “ And what do you suppose , you conceited female , ” said Mr. Cruncher , with unconscious inconsistency , “ that the worth of _your_ prayers may be ? Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at ! ” “ They only come from the heart , Jerry . They are worth no more than that. ” “ Worth no more than that , ” repeated Mr. Cruncher . “ They ain ’ t worth much , then . Whether or no , I won ’ t be prayed agin , I tell you . I can ’ t afford it . I ’ m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking . If you must go flopping yourself down , flop in favour of your husband and child , and not in opposition to ’ em . If I had had any but a unnat ’ ral wife , and this poor boy had had any but a unnat ’ ral mother , I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck . B-u-u-ust me ! ” said Mr. Cruncher , who all this time had been putting on his clothes , “ if I ain ’ t , what with piety and one blowed thing and another , been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with ! Young Jerry , dress yourself , my boy , and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then , and if you see any signs of more flopping , give me a call . For , I tell you , ” here he addressed his wife once more , “ I won ’ t be gone agin , in this manner . I am as rickety as a hackney-coach , I ’ m as sleepy as laudanum , my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn ’ t know , if it wasn ’ t for the pain in ’ em , which was me and which somebody else , yet I ’ m none the better for it in pocket ; and it ’ s my suspicion that you ’ ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket , and I won ’ t put up with it , Aggerawayter , and what do you say now ! ” Growling , in addition , such phrases as “ Ah ! yes ! You ’ re religious , too . You wouldn ’ t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you ? Not you ! ” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business . In the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father ’ s did , kept the required watch upon his mother . He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals , by darting out of his sleeping closet , where he made his toilet , with a suppressed cry of “ You are going to flop , mother . -- Halloa , father ! ” and , after raising this fictitious alarm , darting in again with an undutiful grin . Mr. Cruncher ’ s temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast . He resented Mrs. Cruncher ’ s saying grace with particular animosity . “ Now , Aggerawayter ! What are you up to ? At it again ? ” His wife explained that she had merely “ asked a blessing. ” “ Don ’ t do it ! ” said Mr. Crunches looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife ’ s petitions . “ I ain ’ t a going to be blest out of house and home . I won ’ t have my wittles blest off my table . Keep still ! ” Exceedingly red-eyed and grim , as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn , Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it , growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie . Towards nine o ’ clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day . It could scarcely be called a trade , in spite of his favourite description of himself as “ a honest tradesman. ” His stock consisted of a wooden stool , made out of a broken-backed chair cut down , which stool , young Jerry , walking at his father ’ s side , carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar : where , with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man ’ s feet , it formed the encampment for the day . On this post of his , Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple , as the Bar itself , -- and was almost as in-looking . Encamped at a quarter before nine , in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson ’ s , Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning , with young Jerry standing by him , when not engaged in making forays through the Bar , to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose . Father and son , extremely like each other , looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street , with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were , bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys . The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance , that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw , while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street . The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson ’ s establishment was put through the door , and the word was given : “ Porter wanted ! ” “ Hooray , father ! Here ’ s an early job to begin with ! ” Having thus given his parent God speed , young Jerry seated himself on the stool , entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing , and cogitated . “ Al-ways rusty ! His fingers is al-ways rusty ! ” muttered young Jerry . “ Where does my father get all that iron rust from ? He don ’ t get no iron rust here ! ” CHAPTER II . A Sight “ You know the Old Bailey well , no doubt ? ” said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger . “ Ye-es , sir , ” returned Jerry , in something of a dogged manner . “ I _do_ know the Bailey. ” “ Just so . And you know Mr. Lorry. ” “ I know Mr. Lorry , sir , much better than I know the Bailey . Much better , ” said Jerry , not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question , “ than I , as a honest tradesman , wish to know the Bailey. ” “ Very well . Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry . He will then let you in. ” “ Into the court , sir ? ” “ Into the court. ” Mr. Cruncher ’ s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another , and to interchange the inquiry , “ What do you think of this ? ” “ Am I to wait in the court , sir ? ” he asked , as the result of that conference . “ I am going to tell you . The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry , and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry ’ s attention , and show him where you stand . Then what you have to do , is , to remain there until he wants you. ” “ Is that all , sir ? ” “ That ’ s all . He wishes to have a messenger at hand . This is to tell him you are there. ” As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note , Mr. Cruncher , after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage , remarked : “ I suppose they ’ ll be trying Forgeries this morning ? ” “ Treason ! ” “ That ’ s quartering , ” said Jerry . “ Barbarous ! ” “ It is the law , ” remarked the ancient clerk , turning his surprised spectacles upon him . “ It is the law. ” “ It ’ s hard in the law to spile a man , I think . It ’ s hard enough to kill him , but it ’ s wery hard to spile him , sir. ” “ Not at all , ” retained the ancient clerk . “ Speak well of the law . Take care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself . I give you that advice. ” “ It ’ s the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , ” said Jerry . “ I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is. ” “ Well , well , ” said the old clerk ; “ we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood . Some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways . Here is the letter . Go along. ” Jerry took the letter , and , remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of , “ You are a lean old one , too , ” made his bow , informed his son , in passing , of his destination , and went his way . They hanged at Tyburn , in those days , so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it . But , the gaol was a vile place , in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised , and where dire diseases were bred , that came into court with the prisoners , and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself , and pulled him off the bench . It had more than once happened , that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner ’ s , and even died before him . For the rest , the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard , from which pale travellers set out continually , in carts and coaches , on a violent passage into the other world : traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road , and shaming few good citizens , if any . So powerful is use , and so desirable to be good use in the beginning . It was famous , too , for the pillory , a wise old institution , that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent ; also , for the whipping-post , another dear old institution , very humanising and softening to behold in action ; also , for extensive transactions in blood-money , another fragment of ancestral wisdom , systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven . Altogether , the Old Bailey , at that date , was a choice illustration of the precept , that “ Whatever is is right ; ” an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy , did it not include the troublesome consequence , that nothing that ever was , was wrong . Making his way through the tainted crowd , dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action , with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly , the messenger found out the door he sought , and handed in his letter through a trap in it . For , people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey , just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam -- only the former entertainment was much the dearer . Therefore , all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded -- except , indeed , the social doors by which the criminals got there , and those were always left wide open . After some delay and demur , the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way , and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court . “ What ’ s on ? ” he asked , in a whisper , of the man he found himself next to . “ Nothing yet. ” “ What ’ s coming on ? ” “ The Treason case. ” “ The quartering one , eh ? ” “ Ah ! ” returned the man , with a relish ; “ he ’ ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged , and then he ’ ll be taken down and sliced before his own face , and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on , and then his head will be chopped off , and he ’ ll be cut into quarters . That ’ s the sentence. ” “ If he ’ s found Guilty , you mean to say ? ” Jerry added , by way of proviso . “ Oh ! they ’ ll find him guilty , ” said the other . “ Don ’ t you be afraid of that. ” Mr. Cruncher ’ s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper , whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry , with the note in his hand . Mr. Lorry sat at a table , among the gentlemen in wigs : not far from a wigged gentleman , the prisoner ’ s counsel , who had a great bundle of papers before him : and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets , whose whole attention , when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards , seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court . After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand , Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry , who had stood up to look for him , and who quietly nodded and sat down again . “ What ’ s _he_ got to do with the case ? ” asked the man he had spoken with . “ Blest if I know , ” said Jerry . “ What have _you_ got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire ? ” “ Blest if I know that either , ” said Jerry . The entrance of the Judge , and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court , stopped the dialogue . Presently , the dock became the central point of interest . Two gaolers , who had been standing there , went out , and the prisoner was brought in , and put to the bar . Everybody present , except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling , stared at him . All the human breath in the place , rolled at him , like a sea , or a wind , or a fire . Eager faces strained round pillars and corners , to get a sight of him ; spectators in back rows stood up , not to miss a hair of him ; people on the floor of the court , laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them , to help themselves , at anybody ’ s cost , to a view of him -- stood a-tiptoe , got upon ledges , stood upon next to nothing , to see every inch of him . Conspicuous among these latter , like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate , Jerry stood : aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along , and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer , and gin , and tea , and coffee , and what not , that flowed at him , and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain . The object of all this staring and blaring , was a young man of about five-and-twenty , well-grown and well-looking , with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye . His condition was that of a young gentleman . He was plainly dressed in black , or very dark grey , and his hair , which was long and dark , was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck ; more to be out of his way than for ornament . As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body , so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek , showing the soul to be stronger than the sun . He was otherwise quite self-possessed , bowed to the Judge , and stood quiet . The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at , was not a sort that elevated humanity . Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence -- had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared -- by just so much would he have lost in his fascination . The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled , was the sight ; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder , yielded the sensation . Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest , according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit , the interest was , at the root of it , Ogreish . Silence in the court ! The accused , who was ( and who knew he was ) being mentally hanged , beheaded , and quartered , by everybody there , neither flinched from the situation , nor assumed any theatrical air in it . He was quiet and attentive ; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest ; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him , so composedly , that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn . The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar , as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever . Over the prisoner ’ s head there was a mirror , to throw the light down upon him . Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it , and had passed from its surface and this earth ’ s together . Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been , if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections , as the ocean is one day to give up its dead . Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved , may have struck the prisoner ’ s mind . Be that as it may , a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face , he looked up ; and when he saw the glass his face flushed , and his right hand pushed the herbs away . It happened , that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left . About on a level with his eyes , there sat , in that corner of the Judge ’ s bench , two persons upon whom his look immediately rested ; so immediately , and so much to the changing of his aspect , that all the eyes that were turned upon him , turned to them . The spectators saw in the two figures , a young lady of little more than twenty , and a gentleman who was evidently her father ; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair , and a certain indescribable intensity of face : not of an active kind , but pondering and self-communing . When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old ; but when it was stirred and broken up -- as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter -- he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life . His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm , as she sat by him , and the other pressed upon it . She had drawn close to him , in her dread of the scene , and in her pity for the prisoner . Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused . This had been so very noticeable , so very powerfully and naturally shown , that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her ; and the whisper went about , “ Who are they ? ” Jerry , the messenger , who had made his own observations , in his own manner , and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption , stretched his neck to hear who they were . The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant , and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back ; at last it got to Jerry : “ Witnesses. ” “ For which side ? ” “ Against. ” “ Against what side ? ” “ The prisoner ’ s. ” The Judge , whose eyes had gone in the general direction , recalled them , leaned back in his seat , and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand , as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope , grind the axe , and hammer the nails into the scaffold . CHAPTER III . A Disappointment Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury , that the prisoner before them , though young in years , was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life . That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before . That , it was certain the prisoner had , for longer than that , been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England , on secret business of which he could give no honest account . That , if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive ( which happily it never was ) , the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered . That Providence , however , had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach , to ferret out the nature of the prisoner ’ s schemes , and , struck with horror , to disclose them to his Majesty ’ s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council . That , this patriot would be produced before them . That , his position and attitude were , on the whole , sublime . That , he had been the prisoner ’ s friend , but , at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy , had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom , on the sacred altar of his country . That , if statues were decreed in Britain , as in ancient Greece and Rome , to public benefactors , this shining citizen would assuredly have had one . That , as they were not so decreed , he probably would not have one . That , Virtue , as had been observed by the poets ( in many passages which he well knew the jury would have , word for word , at the tips of their tongues ; whereat the jury ’ s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages ) , was in a manner contagious ; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism , or love of country . That , the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown , to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour , had communicated itself to the prisoner ’ s servant , and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master ’ s table-drawers and pockets , and secrete his papers . That , he ( Mr. Attorney-General ) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant ; but that , in a general way , he preferred him to his ( Mr. Attorney-General ’ s ) brothers and sisters , and honoured him more than his ( Mr. Attorney-General ’ s ) father and mother . That , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise . That , the evidence of these two witnesses , coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced , would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty ’ s forces , and of their disposition and preparation , both by sea and land , and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power . That , these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner ’ s handwriting ; but that it was all the same ; that , indeed , it was rather the better for the prosecution , as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions . That , the proof would go back five years , and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions , within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans . That , for these reasons , the jury , being a loyal jury ( as he knew they were ) , and being a responsible jury ( as _they_ knew they were ) , must positively find the prisoner Guilty , and make an end of him , whether they liked it or not . That , they never could lay their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows ; in short , that there never more could be , for them or theirs , any laying of heads upon pillows at all , unless the prisoner ’ s head was taken off . That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them , in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it , and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone . When the Attorney-General ceased , a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner , in anticipation of what he was soon to become . When toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box . Mr. Solicitor-General then , following his leader ’ s lead , examined the patriot : John Barsad , gentleman , by name . The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be -- perhaps , if it had a fault , a little too exactly . Having released his noble bosom of its burden , he would have modestly withdrawn himself , but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him , sitting not far from Mr. Lorry , begged to ask him a few questions . The wigged gentleman sitting opposite , still looking at the ceiling of the court . Had he ever been a spy himself ? No , he scorned the base insinuation . What did he live upon ? His property . Where was his property ? He didn ’ t precisely remember where it was . What was it ? No business of anybody ’ s . Had he inherited it ? Yes , he had . From whom ? Distant relation . Very distant ? Rather . Ever been in prison ? Certainly not . Never in a debtors ’ prison ? Didn ’ t see what that had to do with it . Never in a debtors ’ prison ? -- Come , once again . Never ? Yes . How many times ? Two or three times . Not five or six ? Perhaps . Of what profession ? Gentleman . Ever been kicked ? Might have been . Frequently ? No . Ever kicked downstairs ? Decidedly not ; once received a kick on the top of a staircase , and fell downstairs of his own accord . Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice ? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault , but it was not true . Swear it was not true ? Positively . Ever live by cheating at play ? Never . Ever live by play ? Not more than other gentlemen do . Ever borrow money of the prisoner ? Yes . Ever pay him ? No . Was not this intimacy with the prisoner , in reality a very slight one , forced upon the prisoner in coaches , inns , and packets ? No . Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists ? Certain . Knew no more about the lists ? No . Had not procured them himself , for instance ? No . Expect to get anything by this evidence ? No . Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps ? Oh dear no . Or to do anything ? Oh dear no . Swear that ? Over and over again . No motives but motives of sheer patriotism ? None whatever . The virtuous servant , Roger Cly , swore his way through the case at a great rate . He had taken service with the prisoner , in good faith and simplicity , four years ago . He had asked the prisoner , aboard the Calais packet , if he wanted a handy fellow , and the prisoner had engaged him . He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity -- never thought of such a thing . He began to have suspicions of the prisoner , and to keep an eye upon him , soon afterwards . In arranging his clothes , while travelling , he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner ’ s pockets , over and over again . He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner ’ s desk . He had not put them there first . He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais , and similar lists to French gentlemen , both at Calais and Boulogne . He loved his country , and couldn ’ t bear it , and had given information . He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot ; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot , but it turned out to be only a plated one . He had known the last witness seven or eight years ; that was merely a coincidence . He didn ’ t call it a particularly curious coincidence ; most coincidences were curious . Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too . He was a true Briton , and hoped there were many like him . The blue-flies buzzed again , and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry . “ Mr . Jarvis Lorry , are you a clerk in Tellson ’ s bank ? ” “ I am. ” “ On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail ? ” “ It did. ” “ Were there any other passengers in the mail ? ” “ Two. ” “ Did they alight on the road in the course of the night ? ” “ They did. ” “ Mr . Lorry , look upon the prisoner . Was he one of those two passengers ? ” “ I can not undertake to say that he was. ” “ Does he resemble either of these two passengers ? ” “ Both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that I can not undertake to say even that. ” “ Mr . Lorry , look again upon the prisoner . Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were , is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them ? ” “ No. ” “ You will not swear , Mr. Lorry , that he was not one of them ? ” “ No. ” “ So at least you say he may have been one of them ? ” “ Yes . Except that I remember them both to have been -- like myself -- timorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air. ” “ Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , Mr. Lorry ? ” “ I certainly have seen that. ” “ Mr . Lorry , look once more upon the prisoner . Have you seen him , to your certain knowledge , before ? ” “ I have. ” “ When ? ” “ I was returning from France a few days afterwards , and , at Calais , the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned , and made the voyage with me. ” “ At what hour did he come on board ? ” “ At a little after midnight. ” “ In the dead of the night . Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour ? ” “ He happened to be the only one. ” “ Never mind about ‘ happening , ’ Mr. Lorry . He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night ? ” “ He was. ” “ Were you travelling alone , Mr. Lorry , or with any companion ? ” “ With two companions . A gentleman and lady . They are here. ” “ They are here . Had you any conversation with the prisoner ? ” “ Hardly any . The weather was stormy , and the passage long and rough , and I lay on a sofa , almost from shore to shore. ” “ Miss Manette ! ” The young lady , to whom all eyes had been turned before , and were now turned again , stood up where she had sat . Her father rose with her , and kept her hand drawn through his arm . “ Miss Manette , look upon the prisoner. ” To be confronted with such pity , and such earnest youth and beauty , was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd . Standing , as it were , apart with her on the edge of his grave , not all the staring curiosity that looked on , could , for the moment , nerve him to remain quite still . His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden ; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart . The buzz of the great flies was loud again . “ Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Where ? ” “ On board of the packet-ship just now referred to , sir , and on the same occasion. ” “ You are the young lady just now referred to ? ” “ O ! most unhappily , I am ! ” The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the Judge , as he said something fiercely : “ Answer the questions put to you , and make no remark upon them. ” “ Miss Manette , had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Recall it. ” In the midst of a profound stillness , she faintly began : “ When the gentleman came on board -- ” “ Do you mean the prisoner ? ” inquired the Judge , knitting his brows . “ Yes , my Lord. ” “ Then say the prisoner. ” “ When the prisoner came on board , he noticed that my father , ” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her , “ was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health . My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air , and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps , and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him . There were no other passengers that night , but we four . The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather , better than I had done . I had not known how to do it well , not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour . He did it for me . He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father ’ s state , and I am sure he felt it . That was the manner of our beginning to speak together. ” “ Let me interrupt you for a moment . Had he come on board alone ? ” “ No. ” “ How many were with him ? ” “ Two French gentlemen. ” “ Had they conferred together ? ” “ They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat. ” “ Had any papers been handed about among them , similar to these lists ? ” “ Some papers had been handed about among them , but I don ’ t know what papers. ” “ Like these in shape and size ? ” “ Possibly , but indeed I don ’ t know , although they stood whispering very near to me : because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there ; it was a dull lamp , and they spoke very low , and I did not hear what they said , and saw only that they looked at papers. ” “ Now , to the prisoner ’ s conversation , Miss Manette. ” “ The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me -- which arose out of my helpless situation -- as he was kind , and good , and useful to my father . I hope , ” bursting into tears , “ I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day. ” Buzzing from the blue-flies . “ Miss Manette , if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give -- which you must give -- and which you can not escape from giving -- with great unwillingness , he is the only person present in that condition . Please to go on. ” “ He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature , which might get people into trouble , and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name . He said that this business had , within a few days , taken him to France , and might , at intervals , take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come. ” “ Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette ? Be particular. ” “ He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen , and he said that , so far as he could judge , it was a wrong and foolish one on England ’ s part . He added , in a jesting way , that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third . But there was no harm in his way of saying this : it was said laughingly , and to beguile the time. ” Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed , will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators . Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence , and , in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down , watched its effect upon the counsel for and against . Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in",A Tale Of Two Cities

Thankless Devotion -- A Newspaper Valedictory -- Conclusion PREFACE This book is a record of a pleasure trip . If it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition , it would have about it that gravity , that profundity , and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind , and withal so attractive . Yet notwithstanding it is only a record of a pic-nic , it has a purpose , which is to suggest to the reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him . I make small pretense of showing anyone how he ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea -- other books do that , and therefore , even if I were competent to do it , there is no need . I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel-writing that may be charged against me -- for I think I have seen with impartial eyes , and I am sure I have written at least honestly , whether wisely or not . In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the Daily Alta California , of San Francisco , the proprietors of that journal having waived their rights and given me the necessary permission . I have also inserted portions of several letters written for the New York Tribune and the New York Herald . THE AUTHOR . SAN FRANCISCO . CHAPTER I . For months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land was chatted about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed at countless firesides . It was a novelty in the way of excursions -- its like had not been thought of before , and it compelled that interest which attractive novelties always command . It was to be a picnic on a gigantic scale . The participants in it , instead of freighting an ungainly steam ferry -- boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts , and paddling up some obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselves out with a long summer day 's laborious frolicking under the impression that it was fun , were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flying and cannon pealing , and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history ! They were to sail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean ; they were to scamper about the decks by day , filling the ship with shouts and laughter -- or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks , or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side , and the shark , the whale , and other strange monsters of the deep ; and at night they were to dance in the open air , on the upper deck , in the midst of a ballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon , and was domed by the bending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the magnificent moon -- dance , and promenade , and smoke , and sing , and make love , and search the skies for constellations that never associate with the “ Big Dipper ” they were so tired of ; and they were to see the ships of twenty navies -- the customs and costumes of twenty curious peoples -- the great cities of half a world -- they were to hob-nob with nobility and hold friendly converse with kings and princes , grand moguls , and the anointed lords of mighty empires ! It was a brave conception ; it was the offspring of a most ingenious brain . It was well advertised , but it hardly needed it : the bold originality , the extraordinary character , the seductive nature , and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhere and advertised it in every household in the land . Who could read the program of the excursion without longing to make one of the party ? I will insert it here . It is almost as good as a map . As a text for this book , nothing could be better : EXCURSION TO THE HOLY LAND , EGYPT , THE CRIMEA , GREECE , AND INTERMEDIATE POINTS OF INTEREST . BROOKLYN , February 1st , 1867 The undersigned will make an excursion as above during the coming season , and begs to submit to you the following programme : A first-class steamer , to be under his own command , and capable of accommodating at least one hundred and fifty cabin passengers , will be selected , in which will be taken a select company , numbering not more than three-fourths of the ship 's capacity . There is good reason to believe that this company can be easily made up in this immediate vicinity , of mutual friends and acquaintances . The steamer will be provided with every necessary comfort , including library and musical instruments . An experienced physician will be on board . Leaving New York about June 1st , a middle and pleasant route will be taken across the Atlantic , and passing through the group of Azores , St. Michael will be reached in about ten days . A day or two will be spent here , enjoying the fruit and wild scenery of these islands , and the voyage continued , and Gibraltar reached in three or four days . A day or two will be spent here in looking over the wonderful subterraneous fortifications , permission to visit these galleries being readily obtained . From Gibraltar , running along the coasts of Spain and France , Marseilles will be reached in three days . Here ample time will be given not only to look over the city , which was founded six hundred years before the Christian era , and its artificial port , the finest of the kind in the Mediterranean , but to visit Paris during the Great Exhibition ; and the beautiful city of Lyons , lying intermediate , from the heights of which , on a clear day , Mont Blanc and the Alps can be distinctly seen . Passengers who may wish to extend the time at Paris can do so , and , passing down through Switzerland , rejoin the steamer at Genoa . From Marseilles to Genoa is a run of one night . The excursionists will have an opportunity to look over this , the “ magnificent city of palaces , ” and visit the birthplace of Columbus , twelve miles off , over a beautiful road built by Napoleon I . From this point , excursions may be made to Milan , Lakes Como and Maggiore , or to Milan , Verona ( famous for its extraordinary fortifications ) , Padua , and Venice . Or , if passengers desire to visit Parma ( famous for Correggio 's frescoes ) and Bologna , they can by rail go on to Florence , and rejoin the steamer at Leghorn , thus spending about three weeks amid the cities most famous for art in Italy . From Genoa the run to Leghorn will be made along the coast in one night , and time appropriated to this point in which to visit Florence , its palaces and galleries ; Pisa , its cathedral and “ Leaning Tower , ” and Lucca and its baths , and Roman amphitheater ; Florence , the most remote , being distant by rail about sixty miles . From Leghorn to Naples ( calling at Civita Vecchia to land any who may prefer to go to Rome from that point ) , the distance will be made in about thirty-six hours ; the route will lay along the coast of Italy , close by Caprera , Elba , and Corsica . Arrangements have been made to take on board at Leghorn a pilot for Caprera , and , if practicable , a call will be made there to visit the home of Garibaldi . Rome [ by rail ] , Herculaneum , Pompeii , Vesuvius , Vergil 's tomb , and possibly the ruins of Paestum can be visited , as well as the beautiful surroundings of Naples and its charming bay . The next point of interest will be Palermo , the most beautiful city of Sicily , which will be reached in one night from Naples . A day will be spent here , and leaving in the evening , the course will be taken towards Athens . Skirting along the north coast of Sicily , passing through the group of Aeolian Isles , in sight of Stromboli and Vulcania , both active volcanoes , through the Straits of Messina , with “ Scylla ” on the one hand and “ Charybdis ” on the other , along the east coast of Sicily , and in sight of Mount Etna , along the south coast of Italy , the west and south coast of Greece , in sight of ancient Crete , up Athens Gulf , and into the Piraeus , Athens will be reached in two and a half or three days . After tarrying here awhile , the Bay of Salamis will be crossed , and a day given to Corinth , whence the voyage will be continued to Constantinople , passing on the way through the Grecian Archipelago , the Dardanelles , the Sea of Marmora , and the mouth of the Golden Horn , and arriving in about forty-eight hours from Athens . After leaving Constantinople , the way will be taken out through the beautiful Bosphorus , across the Black Sea to Sebastopol and Balaklava , a run of about twenty-four hours . Here it is proposed to remain two days , visiting the harbors , fortifications , and battlefields of the Crimea ; thence back through the Bosphorus , touching at Constantinople to take in any who may have preferred to remain there ; down through the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles , along the coasts of ancient Troy and Lydia in Asia , to Smyrna , which will be reached in two or two and a half days from Constantinople . A sufficient stay will be made here to give opportunity of visiting Ephesus , fifty miles distant by rail . From Smyrna towards the Holy Land the course will lay through the Grecian Archipelago , close by the Isle of Patmos , along the coast of Asia , ancient Pamphylia , and the Isle of Cyprus . Beirut will be reached in three days . At Beirut time will be given to visit Damascus ; after which the steamer will proceed to Joppa . From Joppa , Jerusalem , the River Jordan , the Sea of Tiberias , Nazareth , Bethany , Bethlehem , and other points of interest in the Holy Land can be visited , and here those who may have preferred to make the journey from Beirut through the country , passing through Damascus , Galilee , Capernaum , Samaria , and by the River Jordan and Sea of Tiberias , can rejoin the steamer . Leaving Joppa , the next point of interest to visit will be Alexandria , which will be reached in twenty-four hours . The ruins of Caesar 's Palace , Pompey 's Pillar , Cleopatra 's Needle , the Catacombs , and ruins of ancient Alexandria will be found worth the visit . The journey to Cairo , one hundred and thirty miles by rail , can be made in a few hours , and from which can be visited the site of ancient Memphis , Joseph 's Granaries , and the Pyramids . From Alexandria the route will be taken homeward , calling at Malta , Cagliari ( in Sardinia ) , and Palma ( in Majorca ) , all magnificent harbors , with charming scenery , and abounding in fruits . A day or two will be spent at each place , and leaving Parma in the evening , Valencia in Spain will be reached the next morning . A few days will be spent in this , the finest city of Spain . From Valencia , the homeward course will be continued , skirting along the coast of Spain . Alicant , Carthagena , Palos , and Malaga will be passed but a mile or two distant , and Gibraltar reached in about twenty-four hours . A stay of one day will be made here , and the voyage continued to Madeira , which will be reached in about three days . Captain Marryatt writes : “ I do not know a spot on the globe which so much astonishes and delights upon first arrival as Madeira. ” A stay of one or two days will be made here , which , if time permits , may be extended , and passing on through the islands , and probably in sight of the Peak of Teneriffe , a southern track will be taken , and the Atlantic crossed within the latitudes of the northeast trade winds , where mild and pleasant weather , and a smooth sea , can always be expected . A call will be made at Bermuda , which lies directly in this route homeward , and will be reached in about ten days from Madeira , and after spending a short time with our friends the Bermudians , the final departure will be made for home , which will be reached in about three days . Already , applications have been received from parties in Europe wishing to join the Excursion there . The ship will at all times be a home , where the excursionists , if sick , will be surrounded by kind friends , and have all possible comfort and sympathy . Should contagious sickness exist in any of the ports named in the program , such ports will be passed , and others of interest substituted . The price of passage is fixed at $ 1,250 , currency , for each adult passenger . Choice of rooms and of seats at the tables apportioned in the order in which passages are engaged ; and no passage considered engaged until ten percent of the passage money is deposited with the treasurer . Passengers can remain on board of the steamer , at all ports , if they desire , without additional expense , and all boating at the expense of the ship . All passages must be paid for when taken , in order that the most perfect arrangements be made for starting at the appointed time . Applications for passage must be approved by the committee before tickets are issued , and can be made to the undersigned . Articles of interest or curiosity , procured by the passengers during the voyage , may be brought home in the steamer free of charge . Five dollars per day , in gold , it is believed , will be a fair calculation to make for all traveling expenses onshore and at the various points where passengers may wish to leave the steamer for days at a time . The trip can be extended , and the route changed , by unanimous vote of the passengers . CHAS . C. DUNCAN , 117 WALL STREET , NEW YORK R. R. G * * * * * * , Treasurer Committee on Applications J. T.

C * * * * * * , Consulting Engineer for U.S. and Canada J. T. H * * * * * , Esq . C. C. DUNCAN P.S. -- The very beautiful and substantial side-wheel steamship “ Quaker City ” has been chartered for the occasion , and will leave New York June 8th . Letters have been issued by the government commending the party to courtesies abroad . What was there lacking about that program to make it perfectly irresistible ? Nothing that any finite mind could discover . Paris , England , Scotland , Switzerland , Italy -- Garibaldi ! The Grecian Archipelago ! Vesuvius ! Constantinople ! Smyrna ! The Holy Land ! Egypt and “ our friends the Bermudians ” ! People in Europe desiring to join the excursion -- contagious sickness to be avoided -- boating at the expense of the ship -- physician on board -- the circuit of the globe to be made if the passengers unanimously desired it -- the company to be rigidly selected by a pitiless “ Committee on Applications ” -- the vessel to be as rigidly selected by as pitiless a “ Committee on Selecting Steamer. ” Human nature could not withstand these bewildering temptations . I hurried to the treasurer 's office and deposited my ten percent . I rejoiced to know that a few vacant staterooms were still left . I did avoid a critical personal examination into my character by that bowelless committee , but I referred to all the people of high standing I could think of in the community who would be least likely to know anything about me . Shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the Plymouth Collection of Hymns would be used on board the ship . I then paid the balance of my passage money . I was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an excursionist . There was happiness in that but it was tame compared to the novelty of being “ select. ” This supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide themselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship , with saddles for Syrian travel , green spectacles and umbrellas , veils for Egypt , and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the Holy Land . Furthermore , it was suggested that although the ship 's library would afford a fair amount of reading matter , it would still be well if each passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks , a Bible , and some standard works of travel . A list was appended , which consisted chiefly of books relating to the Holy Land , since the Holy Land was part of the excursion and seemed to be its main feature . Reverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition , but urgent duties obliged him to give up the idea . There were other passengers who could have been spared better and would have been spared more willingly . Lieutenant General Sherman was to have been of the party also , but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains . A popular actress had entered her name on the ship 's books , but something interfered and she could n't go . The “ Drummer Boy of the Potomac ” deserted , and lo , we had never a celebrity left ! However , we were to have a “ battery of guns ” from the Navy Department ( as per advertisement ) to be used in answering royal salutes ; and the document furnished by the Secretary of the Navy , which was to make “ General Sherman and party ” welcome guests in the courts and camps of the old world , was still left to us , though both document and battery , I think , were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions . However , had not we the seductive program still , with its Paris , its Constantinople , Smyrna , Jerusalem , Jericho , and “ our friends the Bermudians ? ” What did we care ? CHAPTER II . Occasionally , during the following month , I dropped in at 117 Wall Street to inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was coming on , how additions to the passenger list were averaging , how many people the committee were decreeing not “ select ” every day and banishing in sorrow and tribulation . I was glad to know that we were to have a little printing press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own . I was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of the gospel , eight doctors , sixteen or eighteen ladies , several military and naval chieftains with sounding titles , an ample crop of “ Professors ” of various kinds , and a gentleman who had “ COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE , ASIA , AND AFRICA ” thundering after his name in one awful blast ! I had carefully prepared myself to take rather a back seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that would alone be permitted to pass through the camel 's eye of that committee on credentials ; I had schooled myself to expect an imposing array of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat still further back in consequence of it maybe ; but I state frankly that I was all unprepared for this crusher . I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing . I said that if that potentate must go over in our ship , why , I supposed he must -- but that to my thinking , when the United States considered it necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean , it would be in better taste , and safer , to take him apart and cart him over in sections in several ships . Ah , if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal , and that his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs for that poor , useless , innocent , mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian Institute , I would have felt so much relieved . During that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for once in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement . Everybody was going to Europe -- I , too , was going to Europe . Everybody was going to the famous Paris Exposition -- I , too , was going to the Paris Exposition . The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports of the country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate . If I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to Europe shortly , I have no distinct remembrance of it now . I walked about the city a good deal with a young Mr. Blucher , who was booked for the excursion . He was confiding , good-natured , unsophisticated , companionable ; but he was not a man to set the river on fire . He had the most extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last to consider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France . We stepped into a store on Broadway one day , where he bought a handkerchief , and when the man could not make change , Mr. B. said : “ Never mind , I 'll hand it to you in Paris. ” “ But I am not going to Paris. ” “ How is -- what did I understand you to say ? ” “ I said I am not going to Paris. ” “ Not going to Paris ! Not g -- -- well , then , where in the nation are you going to ? ” “ Nowhere at all. ” “ Not anywhere whatsoever ? -- not any place on earth but this ? ” “ Not any place at all but just this -- stay here all summer. ” My comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word -- walked out with an injured look upon his countenance . Up the street apiece he broke silence and said impressively : “ It was a lie -- that is my opinion of it ! ” In the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers . I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate , and found him to be intelligent , cheerful of spirit , unselfish , full of generous impulses , patient , considerate , and wonderfully good-natured . Not any passenger that sailed in the Quaker City will withhold his endorsement of what I have just said . We selected a stateroom forward of the wheel , on the starboard side , “ below decks. ” It bad two berths in it , a dismal dead-light , a sink with a washbowl in it , and a long , sumptuously cushioned locker , which was to do service as a sofa -- partly -- and partly as a hiding place for our things . Notwithstanding all this furniture , there was still room to turn around in , but not to swing a cat in , at least with entire security to the cat . However , the room was large , for a ship 's stateroom , and was in every way satisfactory . The vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in June . A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship and went on board . All was bustle and confusion . The pier was crowded with carriages and men ; passengers were arriving and hurrying on board ; the vessel 's decks were encumbered with trunks and valises ; groups of excursionists , arrayed in unattractive traveling costumes , were moping about in a drizzling rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens . The gallant flag was up , but it was under the spell , too , and hung limp and disheartened by the mast . Altogether , it was the bluest , bluest spectacle ! It was a pleasure excursion -- there was no gainsaying that , because the program said so -- it was so nominated in the bond -- but it surely had n't the general aspect of one . Finally , above the banging , and rumbling , and shouting , and hissing of steam rang the order to “ cast off ! ” -- a sudden rush to the gangways -- a scampering ashore of visitors-a revolution of the wheels , and we were off -- the pic-nic was begun ! Two very mild cheers went up from the dripping crowd on the pier ; we answered them gently from the slippery decks ; the flag made an effort to wave , and failed ; the “ battery of guns ” spake not -- the ammunition was out . We steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor . It was still raining . And not only raining , but storming . “ Outside ” we could see , ourselves , that there was a tremendous sea on . We must lie still , in the calm harbor , till the storm should abate . Our passengers hailed from fifteen states ; only a few of them had ever been to sea before ; manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until they had got their sea-legs on . Toward evening the two steam tugs that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and ancient form departed , and we were alone on the deep . On deep five fathoms , and anchored fast to the bottom . And out in the solemn rain , at that . This was pleasuring with a vengeance . It was an appropriate relief when the gong sounded for prayer meeting . The first Saturday night of any other pleasure excursion might have been devoted to whist and dancing ; but I submit it to the unprejudiced mind if it would have been in good taste for us to engage in such frivolities , considering what we had gone through and the frame of mind we were in . We would have shone at a wake , but not at anything more festive . However , there is always a cheering influence about the sea ; and in my berth that night , rocked by the measured swell of the waves and lulled by the murmur of the distant surf , I soon passed tranquilly out of all consciousness of the dreary experiences of the day and damaging premonitions of the future . CHAPTER III . All day Sunday at anchor . The storm had gone down a great deal , but the sea had not . It was still piling its frothy hills high in air “ outside , ” as we could plainly see with the glasses . We could not properly begin a pleasure excursion on Sunday ; we could not offer untried stomachs to so pitiless a sea as that . We must lie still till Monday . And we did . But we had repetitions of church and prayer-meetings ; and so , of course , we were just as eligibly situated as we could have been any where . I was up early that Sabbath morning and was early to breakfast . I felt a perfectly natural desire to have a good , long , unprejudiced look at the passengers at a time when they should be free from self-consciousness -- which is at breakfast , when such a moment occurs in the lives of human beings at all . I was greatly surprised to see so many elderly people -- I might almost say , so many venerable people . A glance at the long lines of heads was apt to make one think it was all gray . But it was not . There was a tolerably fair sprinkling of young folks , and another fair sprinkling of gentlemen and ladies who were non-committal as to age , being neither actually old or absolutely young . The next morning we weighed anchor and went to sea . It was a great happiness to get away after this dragging , dispiriting delay . I thought there never was such gladness in the air before , such brightness in the sun , such beauty in the sea . I was satisfied with the picnic then and with all its belongings . All my malicious instincts were dead within me ; and as America faded out of sight , I think a spirit of charity rose up in their place that was as boundless , for the time being , as the broad ocean that was heaving its billows about us . I wished to express my feelings -- I wished to lift up my voice and sing ; but I did not know anything to sing , and so I was obliged to give up the idea . It was no loss to the ship , though , perhaps . It was breezy and pleasant , but the sea was still very rough . One could not promenade without risking his neck ; at one moment the bowsprit was taking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven , and at the next it was trying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean . What a weird sensation it is to feel the stern of a ship sinking swiftly from under you and see the bow climbing high away among the clouds ! One 's safest course that day was to clasp a railing and hang on ; walking was too precarious a pastime . By some happy fortune I was not seasick. -- That was a thing to be proud of . I had not always escaped before . If there is one thing in the world that will make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited , it is to have his stomach behave itself , the first day at sea , when nearly all his comrades are seasick . Soon a venerable fossil , shawled to the chin and bandaged like a mummy , appeared at the door of the after deck-house , and the next lurch of the ship shot him into my arms . I said : “ Good-morning , Sir . It is a fine day. ” He put his hand on his stomach and said , “ Oh , my ! ” and then staggered away and fell over the coop of a skylight . Presently another old gentleman was projected from the same door with great violence . I said : “ Calm yourself , Sir -- There is no hurry . It is a fine day , Sir. ” He , also , put his hand on his stomach and said “ Oh , my ! ” and reeled away . In a little while another veteran was discharged abruptly from the same door , clawing at the air for a saving support . I said : “ Good morning , Sir . It is a fine day for pleasuring . You were about to say -- ” “ Oh , my ! ” I thought so . I anticipated him , anyhow . I stayed there and was bombarded with old gentlemen for an hour , perhaps ; and all I got out of any of them was “ Oh , my ! ” I went away then in a thoughtful mood . I said , this is a good pleasure excursion . I like it . The passengers are not garrulous , but still they are sociable . I like those old people , but somehow they all seem to have the “ Oh , my ” rather bad . I knew what was the matter with them . They were seasick . And I was glad of it . We all like to see people seasick when we are not , ourselves . Playing whist by the cabin lamps when it is storming outside is pleasant ; walking the quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant ; smoking in the breezy foretop is pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there ; but these are all feeble and commonplace compared with the joy of seeing people suffering the miseries of seasickness . I picked up a good deal of information during the afternoon . At one time I was climbing up the quarterdeck when the vessel 's stem was in the sky ; I was smoking a cigar and feeling passably comfortable . Somebody ejaculated : “ Come , now , that wo n't answer . Read the sign up there -- NO SMOKING ABAFT THE WHEEL ! ” It was Captain Duncan , chief of the expedition . I went forward , of course . I saw a long spyglass lying on a desk in one of the upper-deck state-rooms back of the pilot-house and reached after it -- there was a ship in the distance . “ Ah , ah -- hands off ! Come out of that ! ” I came out of that . I said to a deck-sweep -- but in a low voice : “ Who is that overgrown pirate with the whiskers and the discordant voice ? ” “ It 's Captain Bursley -- executive officer -- sailing master. ” I loitered about awhile , and then , for want of something better to do , fell to carving a railing with my knife . Somebody said , in an insinuating , admonitory voice : “ Now , say -- my friend -- do n't you know any better than to be whittling the ship all to pieces that way ? You ought to know better than that. ” I went back and found the deck sweep . “ Who is that smooth-faced , animated outrage yonder in the fine clothes ? ” “ That 's Captain L * * * * , the owner of the ship -- he 's one of the main bosses. ” In the course of time I brought up on the starboard side of the pilot-house and found a sextant lying on a bench . Now , I said , they “ take the sun ” through this thing ; I should think I might see that vessel through it . I had hardly got it to my eye when someone touched me on the shoulder and said deprecatingly : “ I 'll have to get you to give that to me , Sir . If there 's anything you'd like to know about taking the sun , I 'd as soon tell you as not -- but I do n't like to trust anybody with that instrument . If you want any figuring done -- Aye , aye , sir ! ” He was gone to answer a call from the other side . I sought the deck-sweep . “ Who is that spider-legged gorilla yonder with the sanctimonious countenance ? ” “ It 's Captain Jones , sir -- the chief mate. ” “ Well . This goes clear away ahead of anything I ever heard of before . Do you -- now I ask you as a man and a brother -- do you think I could venture to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting a captain of this ship ? ” “ Well , sir , I do n't know -- I think likely you 'd fetch the captain of the watch may be , because he 's a-standing right yonder in the way. ” I went below -- meditating and a little downhearted . I thought , if five cooks can spoil a broth , what may not five captains do with a pleasure excursion . CHAPTER IV . We plowed along bravely for a week or more , and without any conflict of jurisdiction among the captains worth mentioning . The passengers soon learned to accommodate themselves to their new circumstances , and life in the ship became nearly as systematically monotonous as the routine of a barrack . I do not mean that it was dull , for it was not entirely so by any means -- but there was a good deal of sameness about it . As is always the fashion at sea , the passengers shortly began to pick up sailor terms -- a sign that they were beginning to feel at home . Half-past six was no longer half-past six to these pilgrims from New England , the South , and the Mississippi Valley , it was “ seven bells ” ; eight , twelve , and four o'clock were “ eight bells ” ; the captain did not take the longitude at nine o'clock , but at “ two bells. ” They spoke glibly of the “ after cabin , ” the “ for'rard cabin , ” “ port and starboard ” and the “ fo'castle. ” At seven bells the first gong rang ; at eight there was breakfast , for such as were not too seasick to eat it . After that all the well people walked arm-in-arm up and down the long promenade deck , enjoying the fine summer mornings , and the seasick ones crawled out and propped themselves up in the lee of the paddle-boxes and ate their dismal tea and toast , and looked wretched . From eleven o'clock until luncheon , and from luncheon until dinner at six in the evening , the employments and amusements were various . Some reading was done , and much smoking and sewing , though not by the same parties ; there were the monsters of the deep to be looked after and wondered at ; strange ships had to be scrutinized through opera-glasses , and sage decisions arrived at concerning them ; and more than that , everybody took a personal interest in seeing that the flag was run up and politely dipped three times in response to the salutes of those strangers ; in the smoking room there were always parties of gentlemen playing euchre , draughts and dominoes , especially dominoes , that delightfully harmless game ; and down on the main deck , “ for'rard ” -- for'rard of the chicken-coops and the cattle -- we had what was called “ horse billiards. ” Horse billiards is a fine game . It affords good , active exercise , hilarity , and consuming excitement . It is a mixture of “ hop-scotch ” and shuffleboard played with a crutch . You stand off three or four steps , with some broad wooden disks before you on the deck , and these you send forward with a vigorous thrust of a long crutch . If a disk stops on a chalk line , it does not count anything . If it stops in division No . 7 , it counts 7 ; in 5 , it counts 5 , and so on . The game is 100 , and four can play at a time . That game would be very simple played on a stationary floor , but with us , to play it well required science . We had to allow for the reeling of the ship to the right or the left . Very often one made calculations for a heel to the right and the ship did not go that way . The consequence was that that disk missed the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two , and then there was humiliation on one side and laughter on the other . When it rained the passengers had to stay in the house , of course -- or at least the cabins -- and amuse themselves with games , reading , looking out of the windows at the very familiar billows , and talking gossip . By 7 o'clock in the evening , dinner was about over ; an hour 's promenade on the upper deck followed ; then the gong sounded and a large majority of the party repaired to the after cabin ( upper ) , a handsome saloon fifty or sixty feet long , for prayers . The unregenerated called this saloon the “ Synagogue. ” The devotions consisted only of two hymns from the Plymouth Collection and a short prayer , and seldom occupied more than fifteen minutes . The hymns were accompanied by parlor-organ music when the sea was smooth enough to allow a performer to sit at the instrument without being lashed to his chair . After prayers the Synagogue shortly took the semblance of a writing school . The like of that picture was never seen in a ship before . Behind the long dining tables on either side of the saloon , and scattered from one end to the other of the latter , some twenty or thirty gentlemen and ladies sat them down under the swaying lamps and for two or three hours wrote diligently in their journals . Alas ! that journals so voluminously begun should come to so lame and impotent a conclusion as most of them did ! I doubt if there is a single pilgrim of all that host but can show a hundred fair pages of journal concerning the first twenty days ' voyaging in the Quaker City , and I am morally certain that not ten of the party can show twenty pages of journal for the succeeding twenty thousand miles of voyaging ! At certain periods it becomes the dearest ambition of a man to keep a faithful record of his performances in a book ; and he dashes at this work with an enthusiasm that imposes on him the notion that keeping a journal is the veriest pastime in the world , and the pleasantest . But if he only lives twenty-one days , he will find out that only those rare natures that are made up of pluck , endurance , devotion to duty for duty 's sake , and invincible determination may hope to venture upon so tremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journal and not sustain a shameful defeat . One of our favorite youths , Jack , a splendid young fellow with a head full of good sense , and a pair of legs that were a wonder to look upon in the way of length and straightness and slimness , used to report progress every morning in the most glowing and spirited way , and say : “ Oh , I 'm coming along bully ! ” ( he was a little given to slang in his happier moods . ) “ I wrote ten pages in my journal last night -- and you know I wrote nine the night before and twelve the night before that . Why , it 's only fun ! ” “ What do you find to put in it , Jack ? ” “ Oh , everything . Latitude and longitude , noon every day ; and how many miles we made last twenty-four hours ; and all the domino games I beat and horse billiards ; and whales and sharks and porpoises ; and the text of the sermon Sundays ( because that 'll tell at home , you know ) ; and the ships we saluted and what nation they were ; and which way the wind was , and whether there was a heavy sea , and what sail we carried , though we don't ever carry any , principally , going against a head wind always -- wonder what is the reason of that ? -- and how many lies Moult has told -- Oh , every thing ! I 've got everything down . My father told me to keep that journal . Father would n't take a thousand dollars for it when I get it done. ” “ No , Jack ; it will be worth more than a thousand dollars -- when you get it done. ” “ Do you ? -- no , but do you think it will , though ? “ Yes , it will be worth at least as much as a thousand dollars -- when you get it done . May be more. ” “ Well , I about half think so , myself . It ai n't no slouch of a journal. ” But it shortly became a most lamentable “ slouch of a journal. ” One night in Paris , after a hard day 's toil in sightseeing , I said : “ Now I 'll go and stroll around the cafes awhile , Jack , and give you a chance to write up your journal , old fellow. ” His countenance lost its fire . He said : “ Well , no , you need n't mind . I think I wo n't run that journal anymore . It is awful tedious . Do you know -- I reckon I 'm as much as four thousand pages behind hand . I have n't got any France in it at all . First I thought I 'd leave France out and start fresh . But that would n't do , would it ? The governor would say , 'Hello , here -- did n't see anything in France ? That cat would n't fight , you know . First I thought I 'd copy France out of the guide-book , like old Badger in the for'rard cabin , who 's writing a book , but there 's more than three hundred pages of it . Oh , I do n't think a journal 's any use -- do you ? They 're only a bother , ai n't they ? ” “ Yes , a journal that is incomplete is n't of much use , but a journal properly kept is worth a thousand dollars -- when you 've got it done. ” “ A thousand ! -- well , I should think so . I would n't finish it for a million. ” His experience was only the experience of the majority of that industrious night school in the cabin . If you wish to inflict a heartless and malignant punishment upon a young person , pledge him to keep a journal a year . A good many expedients were resorted to to keep the excursionists amused and satisfied . A club was formed , of all the passengers , which met in the writing school after prayers and read aloud about the countries we were approaching and discussed the information so obtained . Several times the photographer of the expedition brought out his transparent pictures and gave us a handsome magic-lantern exhibition . His views were nearly all of foreign scenes , but there were one or two home pictures among them . He advertised that he would “ open his performance in the after cabin at 'two bells ' ( nine P.M. ) and show the passengers where they shall eventually arrive ” -- which was all very well , but by a funny accident the first picture that flamed out upon the canvas was a view of Greenwood Cemetery ! On several starlight nights we danced on the upper deck , under the awnings , and made something of a ball-room display of brilliancy by hanging a number of ship 's lanterns to the stanchions . Our music consisted of the well-mixed strains of a melodeon which was a little asthmatic and apt to catch its breath where it ought to come out strong , a clarinet which was a little unreliable on the high keys and rather melancholy on the low ones , and a disreputable accordion that had a leak somewhere and breathed louder than it squawked -- a more elegant term does not occur to me just now . However , the dancing was infinitely worse than the music . When the ship rolled to starboard the whole platoon of dancers came charging down to starboard with it , and brought up in mass at the rail ; and when it rolled to port they went floundering down to port with the same unanimity of sentiment . Waltzers spun around precariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying down to the rail as if they meant to go overboard . The Virginia reel , as performed on board the Quaker City , had more genuine reel about it than any reel I ever saw before , and was as full of interest to the spectator as it was full of desperate chances and hairbreadth escapes to the participant . We gave up dancing , finally . We celebrated a lady 's birthday anniversary with toasts , speeches , a poem , and so forth . We also had a mock trial . No ship ever went to sea that had n't a mock trial on board . The purser was accused of stealing an overcoat from stateroom No . 10 . A judge was appointed ; also clerks , a crier of the court , constables , sheriffs ; counsel for the State and for the defendant ; witnesses were subpoenaed , and a jury empaneled after much challenging . The witnesses were stupid and unreliable and contradictory , as witnesses always are . The counsel were eloquent , argumentative , and vindictively abusive of each other , as was characteristic and proper . The case was at last submitted and duly finished by the judge with an absurd decision and a ridiculous sentence . The acting of charades was tried on several evenings by the young gentlemen and ladies , in the cabins , and proved the most distinguished success of all the amusement experiments . An attempt was made to organize a debating club , but it was a failure . There was no oratorical talent in the ship . We all enjoyed ourselves -- I think I can safely say that , but it was in a rather quiet way . We very , very seldom played the piano ; we played the flute and the clarinet together , and made good music , too , what there was of it , but we always played the same old tune ; it was a very pretty tune -- how well I remember it -- I wonder when I shall ever get rid of it . We never played either the melodeon or the organ except at devotions -- but I am too fast : young Albert did know part of a tune something about “ O Something-Or-Other How Sweet It Is to Know That He 's His What's-his-Name ” ( I do not remember the exact title of it , but it was very plaintive and full of sentiment ) ; Albert played that pretty much all the time until we contracted with him to restrain himself . But nobody ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck , and the congregational singing at church and prayers was not of a superior order of architecture . I put up with it as long as I could and then joined in and tried to improve it , but this encouraged young George to join in too , and that made a failure of it ; because George 's voice was just “ turning , ” and when he was singing a dismal sort of bass it was apt to fly off the handle and startle everybody with a most discordant cackle on the upper notes . George did n't know the tunes , either , which was also a drawback to his performances . I said : “ Come , now , George , do n't improvise . It looks too egotistical . Just stick to 'Coronation , ' like the others . It is a good tune -- you ca n't improve it any , just off-hand , in this way. ” “ Why , I 'm not trying to improve it -- and I am singing like the others -- just as it is in the notes. ” And he honestly thought he was , too ; and so he had no one to blame but himself when his voice caught on the center occasionally and gave him the lockjaw . There were those among the unregenerated who attributed the unceasing head-winds to our distressing choir-music . There were those who said openly that it was taking chances enough to have such ghastly music going on , even when it was at its best ; and that to exaggerate the crime by letting George help was simply flying in the face of Providence . These said that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melody until they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship . There were even grumblers at the prayers . The executive officer said the pilgrims had no charity : “ There they are , down there every night at eight bells , praying for fair winds -- when they know as well as I do that this is the only ship going east this time of the year , but there 's a thousand coming west -- what 's a fair wind for us is a head wind to them -- the Almighty 's blowing a fair wind for a thousand vessels , and this tribe wants him to turn it clear around so as to accommodate one -- and she a steamship at that ! It ain't good sense , it ai n't good reason , it ai n't good Christianity , it ain't common human charity . Avast with such nonsense ! ” CHAPTER V. Taking it “ by and large , ” as the sailors say , we had a pleasant ten days' run from New York to the Azores islands -- not a fast run , for the distance is only twenty-four hundred miles , but a right pleasant one in the main . True , we had head winds all the time , and several stormy experiences which sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and made the ship look dismal and deserted -- stormy experiences that all will remember who weathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast sheets of spray that every now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and swept the ship like a thunder-shower ; but for the most part we had balmy summer weather and nights that were even finer than the days . We had the phenomenon of a full moon located just in the same spot in the heavens at the same hour every night . The reason of this singular conduct on the part of the moon did not occur to us at first , but it did afterward when we reflected that we were gaining about twenty minutes every day because we were going east so fast -- we gained just about enough every day to keep along with the moon . It was becoming an old moon to the friends we had left behind us , but to us Joshuas it stood still in the same place and remained always the same . Young Mr. Blucher , who is from the Far West and is on his first voyage , was a good deal worried by the constantly changing “ ship time. ” He was proud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly when eight bells struck at noon , but he came to look after a while as if he were losing confidence in it . Seven days out from New York he came on deck and said with great decision : “ This thing 's a swindle ! ” “ What 's a swindle ? ” “ Why , this watch . I bought her out in Illinois -- gave $ 150 for her -- and I thought she was good . And , by George , she is good onshore , but somehow she do n't keep up her lick here on the water -- gets seasick may be . She skips ; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven , and then , all of a sudden , she lets down . I 've set that old regulator up faster and faster , till I 've shoved it clear around , but it do n't do any good ; she just distances every watch in the ship , and clatters along in a way that 's astonishing till it is noon , but them eight bells always gets in about ten minutes ahead of her anyway . I do n't know what to do with her now . She 's doing all she can -- she 's going her best gait , but it won't save her . Now , do n't you know , there ai n't a watch in the ship that's making better time than she is , but what does it signify ? When you hear them eight bells you 'll find her just about ten minutes short of her score sure. ” The ship was gaining a full hour every three days , and this fellow was trying to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her . But , as he had said , he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go , and the watch was “ on its best gait , ” and so nothing was left him but to fold his hands and see the ship beat the race . We sent him to the captain , and he explained to him the mystery of “ ship time ” and set his troubled mind at rest . This young man asked a great many questions about seasickness before we left , and wanted to know what its characteristics were and how he was to tell when he had it . He found out . We saw the usual sharks , blackfish , porpoises , & c. , of course , and by and by large schools of Portuguese men-of-war were added to the regular list of sea wonders . Some of them were white and some of a brilliant carmine color . The nautilus is nothing but a transparent web of jelly that spreads itself to catch the wind , and has fleshy-looking strings a foot or two long dangling from it to keep it steady in the water . It is an accomplished sailor and has good sailor judgment . It reefs its sail when a storm threatens or the wind blows pretty hard , and furls it entirely and goes down when a gale blows . Ordinarily it keeps its sail wet and in good sailing order by turning over and dipping it in the water for a moment . Seamen say the nautilus is only found in these waters between the 35th and 45th parallels of latitude . At three o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first of June , we were awakened and notified that the Azores islands were in sight . I said I did not take any interest in islands at three o'clock in the morning . But another persecutor came , and then another and another , and finally believing that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in peace , I got up and went sleepily on deck . It was five and a half o'clock now , and a raw , blustering morning . The passengers were huddled about the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators , and all were wrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitiless gale and the drenching spray . The island in sight was Flores . It seemed only a mountain of mud standing up out of the dull mists of the sea . But as we bore down upon it the sun came out and made it a beautiful picture -- a mass of green farms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet and mingled its upper outlines with the clouds . It was ribbed with sharp , steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons , and here and there on the heights , rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements and castles ; and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight , that painted summit , and slope and glen , with bands of fire , and left belts of somber shade between . It was the aurora borealis of the frozen pole exiled to a summer land ! We skirted around two-thirds of the island , four miles from shore , and all the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to settle disputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of trees or groves of weeds , or whether the white villages down by the sea were really villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries . Finally we stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel , and Flores shortly became a dome of mud again and sank down among the mists , and disappeared . But to many a seasick passenger it was good to see the green hills again , and all were more cheerful after this episode than anybody could have expected them to be , considering how sinfully early they had gotten up . But we had to change our purpose about San Miguel , for a storm came up about noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense dictated a run for shelter . Therefore we steered for the nearest island of the group -- Fayal ( the people there pronounce it Fy-all , and put the accent on the first syllable ) . We anchored in the open roadstead of Horta , half a mile from the shore . The town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants . Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation , and no village could look prettier or more attractive . It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high , and carefully cultivated clear to their summits -- not a foot of soil left idle . Every farm and every acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls , whose duty it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that blow there . The islands belong to Portugal , and everything in Fayal has Portuguese characteristics about it . But more of that anon . A swarm of swarthy , noisy , lying , shoulder-shrugging , gesticulating Portuguese boatmen , with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts , climbed the ship's sides , and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore at so much a head , silver coin of any country . We landed under the walls of a little fort , armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders , which Horta considered a most formidable institution , but if we were ever to get after it with one of our turreted monitors , they would have to move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it . The group on the pier was a rusty one -- men and women , and boys and girls , all ragged and barefoot , uncombed and unclean , and by instinct , education , and profession beggars . They trooped after us , and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid of them . We walked up the middle of the principal street , and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us ; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back , just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street . It was very flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation . Here and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on . This hood is of thick blue cloth , attached to a cloak of the same stuff , and is a marvel of ugliness . It stands up high and spreads far abroad , and is unfathomably deep . It fits like a circus tent , and a woman 's head is hidden away in it like the man 's who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera . There is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote , as they call it -- it is just a plain , ugly dead-blue mass of sail , and a woman ca n't go within eight points of the wind with one of them on ; she has to go before the wind or not at all . The general style of the capote is the same in all the islands , and will remain so for the next ten thousand years , but each island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from . The Portuguese pennies , or reis ( pronounced rays ) , are prodigious . It takes one thousand reis to make a dollar , and all financial estimates are made in reis . We did not know this until after we had found it out through Blucher . Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on solid land once more that he wanted to give a feast -- said he had heard it was a cheap land , and he was bound to have a grand banquet . He invited nine of us , and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel . In the midst of the jollity produced by good cigars , good wine , and passable anecdotes , the landlord presented his bill . Blucher glanced at it and his countenance fell . He took another look to assure himself that his senses had not deceived him and then read the items aloud , in a faltering voice , while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes : “ 'Ten dinners , at 600 reis , 6,000 reis ! ' Ruin and desolation ! “ 'Twenty-five cigars , at 100 reis , 2,500 reis ! ' Oh , my sainted mother ! “ 'Eleven bottles of wine , at 1,200 reis , 13,200 reis ! ' Be with us all ! “ 'TOTAL , TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED REIS ! ' The suffering Moses ! There ai n't money enough in the ship to pay that bill ! Go -- leave me to my misery , boys , I am a ruined community. ” I think it was the blankest-looking party I ever saw . Nobody could say a word . It was as if every soul had been stricken dumb . Wine glasses descended slowly to the table , their contents untasted . Cigars dropped unnoticed from nerveless fingers . Each man sought his neighbor 's eye , but found in it no ray of hope , no encouragement . At last the fearful silence was broken . The shadow of a desperate resolve settled upon Blucher 's countenance like a cloud , and he rose up and said : “ Landlord , this is a low , mean swindle , and I 'll never , never stand it . Here 's a hundred and fifty dollars , Sir , and it 's all you 'll get -- I'll swim in blood before I 'll pay a cent more. ” Our spirits rose and the landlord 's fell -- at least we thought so ; he was confused , at any rate , notwithstanding he had not understood a word that had been said . He glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to Blucher several times and then went out . He must have visited an American , for when he returned , he brought back his bill translated into a language that a Christian could understand -- thus : 10 dinners , 6,000 reis , or . . . $ 6.00 25 cigars , 2,500 reis , or . . . 2.50 11 bottles wine , 13,200 reis , or 13.20 Total 21,700 reis , or . . . . $ 21.70 Happiness reigned once more in Blucher 's dinner party . More refreshments were ordered . CHAPTER VI . I think the Azores must be very little known in America . Out of our whole ship 's company there was not a solitary individual who knew anything whatever about them . Some of the party , well read concerning most other lands , had no other information about the Azores than that they were a group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic , something more than halfway between New York and Gibraltar . That was all . These considerations move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts just here . The community is eminently Portuguese -- that is to say , it is slow , poor , shiftless , sleepy , and lazy . There is a civil governor , appointed by the King of Portugal , and also a military governor , who can assume supreme control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure . The islands contain a population of about 200,000 , almost entirely Portuguese . Everything is staid and settled , for the country was one hundred years old when Columbus discovered America . The principal crop is corn , and they raise it and grind it just as their great-great-great-grandfathers did . They plow with a board slightly shod with iron ; their trifling little harrows are drawn by men and women ; small windmills grind the corn , ten bushels a day , and there is one assistant superintendent to feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going to sleep . When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and actually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are in proper position , instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could be moved instead of the mill . Oxen tread the wheat from the ear , after the fashion prevalent in the time of Methuselah . There is not a wheelbarrow in the land -- they carry everything on their heads , or on donkeys , or in a wicker-bodied cart , whose wheels are solid blocks of wood and whose axles turn with the wheel . There is not a modern plow in the islands or a threshing machine . All attempts to introduce them have failed . The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did before him . The climate is mild ; they never have snow or ice , and I saw no chimneys in the town . The donkeys and the men , women , and children of a family all eat and sleep in the same room , and are unclean , are ravaged by vermin , and are truly happy . The people lie , and cheat the stranger , and are desperately ignorant , and have hardly any reverence for their dead . The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep with . The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp are the half a dozen well-to-do families , the Jesuit priests , and the soldiers of the little garrison . The wages of a laborer are twenty to twenty-four cents a day , and those of a good mechanic about twice as much . They count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar , and this makes them rich and contented . Fine grapes used to grow in the islands , and an excellent wine was made and exported . But a disease killed all the vines fifteen years ago , and since that time no wine has been made . The islands being wholly of volcanic origin , the soil is necessarily very rich . Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation , and two or three crops a year of each article are produced , but nothing is exported save a few oranges -- chiefly to England . Nobody comes here , and nobody goes away . News is a thing unknown in Fayal . A thirst for it is a passion equally unknown . A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our civil war was over . Because , he said , somebody had told him it was -- or at least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something like that ! And when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of the Tribune , the Herald , and Times , he was surprised to find later news in them from Lisbon than he had just received by the little monthly steamer . He was told that it came by cable . He said he knew they had tried to lay a cable ten years ago , but it had been in his mind somehow that they had n't succeeded ! It is in communities like this that Jesuit humbuggery flourishes . We visited a Jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it a piece of the veritable cross upon which our Saviour was crucified . It was polished and hard , and in as excellent a state of preservation as if the dread tragedy on Calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteen centuries ago . But these confiding people believe in that piece of wood unhesitatingly . In a chapel of the cathedral is an altar with facings of solid silver -- at least they call it so , and I think myself it would go a couple of hundred to the ton ( to speak after the fashion of the silver miners ) -- and before it is kept forever burning a small lamp . A devout lady who died , left money and contracted for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul , and also stipulated that this lamp should be kept lighted always , day and night . She did all this before she died , you understand . It is a very small lamp and a very dim one , and it could not work her much damage , I think , if it went out altogether . The great altar of the cathedral and also three or four minor ones are a perfect mass of gilt gimcracks and gingerbread . And they have a swarm of rusty , dusty , battered apostles standing around the filagree work , some on one leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other , and some with two or three fingers gone , and some with not enough nose left to blow -- all of them crippled and discouraged , and fitter subjects for the hospital than the cathedral . The walls of the chancel are of porcelain , all pictured over with figures of almost life size , very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fanciful costumes of two centuries ago . The design was a history of something or somebody , but none of us were learned enough to read the story . The old father , reposing under a stone close by , dated 1686 , might have told us if he could have risen . But he did n't . As we came down through the town we encountered a squad of little donkeys ready saddled for use . The saddles were peculiar , to say the least . They consisted of a sort of saw-buck with a small mattress on it , and this furniture covered about half the donkey . There were no stirrups , but really such supports were not needed -- to use such a saddle was the next thing to riding a dinner table -- there was ample support clear out to one 's knee joints . Half a dozen of us mounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the indignity of making a ridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal streets of a town of 10,000 inhabitants . We started . It was not a trot , a gallop , or a canter , but a stampede , and made up of all possible or conceivable gaits . No spurs were necessary . There was a muleteer to every donkey and a dozen volunteers beside , and they banged the donkeys with their goad sticks , and pricked them with their spikes , and shouted something that sounded like “ Sekki-yah ! ” and kept up a din and a racket that was worse than Bedlam itself . These rascals were all on foot , but no matter , they were always up to time -- they can outrun and outlast a donkey . Altogether , ours was a lively and a picturesque procession , and drew crowded audiences to the balconies wherever we went . Blucher could do nothing at all with his donkey . The beast scampered zigzag across the road and the others ran into him ; he scraped Blucher against carts and the corners of houses ; the road was fenced in with high stone walls , and the donkey gave him a polishing first on one side and then on the other , but never once took the middle ; he finally came to the house he was born in and darted into the parlor , scraping Blucher off at the doorway . After remounting , Blucher said to the muleteer , “ Now , that 's enough , you know ; you go slow hereafter. ” But the fellow knew no English and did not understand , so he simply said , “ Sekki-yah ! ” and the donkey was off again like a shot . He turned a corner suddenly , and Blucher went over his head . And , to speak truly , every mule stumbled over the two , and the whole cavalcade was piled up in a heap . No harm done . A fall from one of those donkeys is of little more consequence than rolling off a sofa . The donkeys all stood still after the catastrophe and waited for their dismembered saddles to be patched up and put on by the noisy muleteers . Blucher was pretty angry and wanted to swear , but every time he opened his mouth his animal did so also and let off a series of brays that drowned all other sounds . It was fun , scurrying around the breezy hills and through the beautiful canyons . There was that rare thing , novelty , about it ; it was a fresh , new , exhilarating sensation , this donkey riding , and worth a hundred worn and threadbare home pleasures . The roads were a wonder , and well they might be . Here was an island with only a handful of people in it -- 25,000 -- and yet such fine roads do not exist in the United States outside of Central Park . Everywhere you go , in any direction , you find either a hard , smooth , level thoroughfare , just sprinkled with black lava sand , and bordered with little gutters neatly paved with small smooth pebbles , or compactly paved ones like Broadway . They talk much of the Russ pavement in New York , and call it a new invention -- yet here they have been using it in this remote little isle of the sea for two hundred years ! Every street in Horta is handsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks , and the surface is neat and true as a floor -- not marred by holes like Broadway . And every road is fenced in by tall , solid lava walls , which will last a thousand years in this land where frost is unknown . They are very thick , and are often plastered and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone . Trees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down , and contrast their bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and make them beautiful . The trees and vines stretch across these narrow roadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be riding through a tunnel . The pavements , the roads , and the bridges are all government work . The bridges are of a single span -- a single arch -- of cut stone , without a support , and paved on top with flags of lava and ornamental pebblework . Everywhere are walls , walls , walls , and all of them tasteful and handsome -- and eternally substantial ; and everywhere are those marvelous pavements , so neat , so smooth , and so indestructible . And if ever roads and streets and the outsides of houses were perfectly free from any sign or semblance of dirt , or dust , or mud , or uncleanliness of any kind , it is Horta , it is Fayal . The lower classes of the people , in their persons and their domiciles , are not clean -- but there it stops -- the town and the island are miracles of cleanliness . We arrived home again finally , after a ten-mile excursion , and the irrepressible muleteers scampered at our heels through the main street , goading the donkeys , shouting the everlasting “ Sekki-yah , ” and singing “ John Brown 's Body ” in ruinous English . When we were dismounted and it came to settling , the shouting and jawing and swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearly deafening . One fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his donkey ; another claimed half a dollar for pricking him up , another a quarter for helping in that service , and about fourteen guides presented bills for showing us the way through the town and its environs ; and every vagrant of them was more vociferous , and more vehement and more frantic in gesture than his neighbor . We paid one guide and paid for one muleteer to each donkey . The mountains on some of the islands are very high . We sailed along the shore of the island of Pico , under a stately green pyramid that rose up with one unbroken sweep from our very feet to an altitude of 7,613 feet , and thrust its summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in a fog ! We got plenty of fresh oranges , lemons , figs , apricots , etc. , in these Azores , of course . But I will desist . I am not here to write Patent Office reports . We are on our way to Gibraltar , and shall reach there five or six days out from the Azores . CHAPTER VII . A week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea ; a week of seasickness and deserted cabins ; of lonely quarterdecks drenched with spray -- spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with a white crust of salt to their very tops ; a week of shivering in the shelter of the lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating “ clouds ” and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at night . And the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all . There was no thunder , no noise but the pounding bows of the ship , the keen whistling of the gale through the cordage , and the rush of the seething waters . But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven -- then paused an instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again , as from a precipice . The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain . The blackness of darkness was everywhere . At long intervals a flash of lightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving world of water where was nothing before , kindled the dusky cordage to glittering silver , and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster ! Fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and the spray . Some thought the vessel could not live through the night , and it seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and see the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral cabins , under the dim lamps , and imagine the horrors that were abroad on the ocean . And once out -- once where they could see the ship struggling in the strong grasp of the storm -- once where they could hear the shriek of the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic picture the lightnings disclosed , they were prisoners to a fierce fascination they could not resist , and so remained . It was a wild night -- and a very , very long one . Everybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven o'clock this lovely morning of the thirtieth of June with the glad news that land was in sight ! It was a rare thing and a joyful , to see all the ship 's family abroad once more , albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenance could only partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms had wrought there . But dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure , pallid cheeks flushed again , and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from the quickening influences of the bright , fresh morning . Yea , and from a still more potent influence : the worn castaways were to see the blessed land again ! -- and to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in all their thoughts . Within the hour we were fairly within the Straits of Gibraltar , the tall yellow-splotched hills of Africa on our right , with their bases veiled in a blue haze and their summits swathed in clouds -- the same being according to Scripture , which says that “ clouds and darkness are over the land. ” The words were spoken of this particular portion of Africa , I believe . On our left were the granite-ribbed domes of old Spain . The strait is only thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part . At short intervals along the Spanish shore were quaint-looking old stone towers -- Moorish , we thought -- but learned better afterwards . In former times the Morocco rascals used to coast along the Spanish Main in their boats till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself , and then dart in and capture a Spanish village and carry off all the pretty women they could find . It was a pleasant business , and was very popular . The Spaniards built these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep a sharper lookout on the Moroccan speculators . The picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of the changeless sea , and by and by the ship 's company grew wonderfully cheerful . But while we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the lowlands robed in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chained every eye like a magnet -- a stately ship , with canvas piled on canvas till she was one towering mass of bellying sail ! She came speeding over the sea like a great bird . Africa and Spain were forgotten . All homage was for the beautiful stranger . While everybody gazed she swept superbly by and flung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze ! Quicker than thought , hats and handkerchiefs flashed in the air , and a cheer went up ! She was beautiful before -- she was radiant now . Many a one on our decks knew then for the first time how tame a sight his country 's flag is at home compared to what it is in a foreign land . To see it is to see a vision of home itself and all its idols , and feel a thrill that would stir a very river of sluggish blood ! We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules , and already the African one , “ Ape 's Hill , ” a grand old mountain with summit streaked with granite ledges , was in sight . The other , the great Rock of Gibraltar , was yet to come . The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the head of navigation and the end of the world . The information the ancients did n't have was very voluminous . Even the prophets wrote book after book and epistle after epistle , yet never once hinted at the existence of a great continent on our side of the water ; yet they must have known it was there , I should think . In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock , standing seemingly in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by the sea , swung magnificently into view , and we needed no tedious traveled parrot to tell us it was Gibraltar . There could not be two rocks like that in one kingdom . The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long , I should say , by 1,400 to 1,500 feet high , and a quarter of a mile wide at its base . One side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the side of a house , the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep slant which an army would find very difficult to climb . At the foot of this slant is the walled town of Gibraltar -- or rather the town occupies part of the slant . Everywhere -- on hillside , in the precipice , by the sea , on the heights -- everywhere you choose to look , Gibraltar is clad with masonry and bristling with guns . It makes a striking and lively picture from whatsoever point you contemplate it . It is pushed out into the sea on the end of a flat , narrow strip of land , and is suggestive of a “ gob ” of mud on the end of a shingle . A few hundred yards of this flat ground at its base belongs to the English , and then , extending across the strip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean , a distance of a quarter of a mile , comes the “ Neutral Ground , ” a space two or three hundred yards wide , which is free to both parties . “ Are you going through Spain to Paris ? ” That question was bandied about the ship day and night from Fayal to Gibraltar , and I thought I never could get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or more tired of answering , “ I do n't know. ” At the last moment six or seven had sufficient decision of character to make up their minds to go , and did go , and I felt a sense of relief at once -- it was forever too late now and I could make up my mind at my leisure not to go . I must have a prodigious quantity of mind ; it takes me as much as a week sometimes to make it up . But behold how annoyances repeat themselves . We had no sooner gotten rid of the Spain distress than the Gibraltar guides started another -- a tiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing about it , even in the first place : “ That high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair ; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair there when the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar , and said she would never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the fortresses . If the English had n't been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day , she 'd have had to break her oath or die up there. ” We rode on asses and mules up the steep , narrow streets and entered the subterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the rock . These galleries are like spacious railway tunnels , and at short intervals in them great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or six hundred feet above the ocean . There is a mile or so of this subterranean work , and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor . The gallery guns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans , but they might as well not be there , I should think , for an army could hardly climb the perpendicular wall of the rock anyhow . Those lofty portholes afford superb views of the sea , though . At one place , where a jutting crag was hollowed out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon and whose windows were portholes , a glimpse was caught of a hill not far away , and a soldier said : “ That high hill yonder is called the Queen 's Chair ; it is because a queen of Spain placed her chair there once when the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar , and said she would never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the fortresses . If the English had n't been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day , she 'd have had to break her oath or die up there. ” On the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good while , and no doubt the mules were tired . They had a right to be . The military road was good , but rather steep , and there was a good deal of it . The view from the narrow ledge was magnificent ; from it vessels seeming like the tiniest little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes , and other vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty , they said , and invisible to the naked eye , could be clearly distinguished through those same telescopes . Below , on one side , we looked down upon an endless mass of batteries and on the other straight down to the sea . While I was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart , and cooling my baking head in the delicious breeze , an officious guide belonging to another party came up and said : “ Senor , that high hill yonder is called the Queen 's Chair -- ” “ Sir , I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land . Have pity on me . Don't -- now do n't inflict that most in-FERNAL old legend on me anymore today ! ” There -- I had used strong language after promising I would never do so again ; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear . If you had been bored so , when you had the noble panorama of Spain and Africa and the blue Mediterranean spread abroad at your feet , and wanted to gaze and enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence , you might have even burst into stronger language than I did . Gibraltar has stood several protracted sieges , one of them of nearly four years ' duration ( it failed ) , and the English only captured it by stratagem . The wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying so impossible a project as the taking it by assault -- and yet it has been tried more than once . The Moors held the place twelve hundred years ago , and a staunch old castle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town , with moss-grown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired in battles and sieges that are forgotten now . A secret chamber in the rock behind it was discovered some time ago , which contained a sword of exquisite workmanship , and some quaint old armor of a fashion that antiquaries are not acquainted with , though it is supposed to be Roman . Roman armor and Roman relics of various kinds have been found in a cave in the sea extremity of Gibraltar ; history says Rome held this part of the country about the Christian era , and these things seem to confirm the statement . In that cave also are found human bones , crusted with a very thick , stony coating , and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only lived before the flood , but as much as ten thousand years before it . It may be true -- it looks reasonable enough -- but as long as those parties ca n't vote anymore , the matter can be of no great public interest . In this cave likewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in every part of Africa , yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any portion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar ! So the theory is that the channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land , and that the low , neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it was once ocean , and of course that these African animals , being over at Gibraltar ( after rock , perhaps -- there is plenty there ) , got closed out when the great change occurred . The hills in Africa , across the channel , are full of apes , and there are now and always have been apes on the rock of Gibraltar -- but not elsewhere in Spain ! The subject is an interesting one . There is an English garrison at Gibraltar of 6,000 or 7,000 men , and so uniforms of flaming red are plenty ; and red and blue , and undress costumes of snowy white , and also the queer uniform of the bare-kneed Highlander ; and one sees soft-eyed Spanish girls from San Roque , and veiled Moorish beauties ( I suppose they are beauties ) from Tarifa , and turbaned , sashed , and trousered Moorish merchants from Fez , and long-robed , bare-legged , ragged Muhammadan vagabonds from Tetuan and Tangier , some brown , some yellow and some as black as virgin ink -- and Jews from all around , in gabardine , skullcap , and slippers , just as they are in pictures and theaters , and just as they were three thousand years ago , no doubt . You can easily understand that a tribe ( somehow our pilgrims suggest that expression , because they march in a straggling procession through these foreign places with such an Indian-like air of complacency and independence about them ) like ours , made up from fifteen or sixteen states of the Union , found enough to stare at in this shifting panorama of fashion today . Speaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people among us who are sometimes an annoyance . However , I do not count the Oracle in that list . I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass who eats for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would have any right to look , and never uses a one-syllable word when he can think of a longer one , and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of any long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place ; yet he will serenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up complacently with quotations from authors who never existed , and finally when cornered will slide to the other side of the question , say he has been there all the time , and come back at you with your own spoken arguments , only with the big words all tangled , and play them in your very teeth as original with himself . He reads a chapter in the guidebooks , mixes the facts all up , with his bad memory , and then goes off to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has been festering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college from erudite authors who are dead now and out of print . This morning at breakfast he pointed out of the window and said : “ Do you see that there hill out there on that African coast ? It 's one of them Pillows of Herkewls , I should say -- and there 's the ultimate one alongside of it. ” “ The ultimate one -- that is a good word -- but the pillars are not both on the same side of the strait. ” ( I saw he had been deceived by a carelessly written sentence in the guidebook . ) “ Well , it ai n't for you to say , nor for me . Some authors states it that way , and some states it different . Old Gibbons do n't say nothing about it -- just shirks it complete -- Gibbons always done that when he got stuck -- but there is Rolampton , what does he say ? Why , he says that they was both on the same side , and Trinculian , and Sobaster , and Syraccus , and Langomarganbl -- -- ” “ Oh , that will do -- that 's enough . If you have got your hand in for inventing authors and testimony , I have nothing more to say -- let them be on the same side. ” We do n't mind the Oracle . We rather like him . We can tolerate the Oracle very easily , but we have a poet and a good-natured enterprising idiot on board , and they do distress the company . The one gives copies of his verses to consuls , commanders , hotel keepers , Arabs , Dutch -- to anybody , in fact , who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindly meant . His poetry is all very well on shipboard , notwithstanding when he wrote an “ Ode to the Ocean in a Storm ” in one half hour , and an “ Apostrophe to the Rooster in the Waist of the Ship ” in the next , the transition was considered to be rather abrupt ; but when he sends an invoice of rhymes to the Governor of Fayal and another to the commander in chief and other dignitaries in Gibraltar with the compliments of the Laureate of the Ship , it is not popular with the passengers . The other personage I have mentioned is young and green , and not bright , not learned , and not wise . He will be , though , someday if he recollects the answers to all his questions . He is known about the ship as the “ Interrogation Point , ” and this by constant use has become shortened to “ Interrogation. ” He has distinguished himself twice already . In Fayal they pointed out a hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1,100 feet long . And they told him there was a tunnel 2,000 feet long and 1,000 feet high running through the hill , from end to end . He believed it . He repeated it to everybody , discussed it , and read it from his notes . He told one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knock Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea ! At this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasure excursion of our own devising . We form rather more than half the list of white passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable Moorish town of Tangier , Africa . Nothing could be more absolutely certain than that we are enjoying ourselves . One can not do otherwise who speeds over these sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunny land . Care can not assail us here . We are out of its jurisdiction . We even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of Malabat ( a stronghold of the Emperor of Morocco ) without a twinge of fear . The whole garrison turned out under arms and assumed a threatening attitude -- yet still we did not fear . The entire garrison marched and counter-marched within the rampart , in full view -- yet notwithstanding even this , we never flinched . I suppose we really do not know what fear is . I inquired the name of the garrison of the fortress of Malabat , and they said it was Mehemet Ali Ben Sancom . I said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons to help him ; but they said no , he had nothing to do but hold the place , and he was competent to do that , had done it two years already . That was evidence which one could not well refute . There is nothing like reputation . Every now and then my glove purchase in Gibraltar last night intrudes itself upon me . Dan and the ship 's surgeon and I had been up to the great square , listening to the music of the fine military bands and contemplating English and Spanish female loveliness and fashion , and at nine o'clock were on our way to the theater , when we met the General , the Judge , the Commodore , the Colonel , and the Commissioner of the United States of America to Europe , Asia , and Africa , who had been to the Club House to register their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare ; and they told us to go over to the little variety store near the Hall of Justice and buy some kid gloves . They said they were elegant and very moderate in price . It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid gloves , and we acted upon the hint . A very handsome young lady in the store offered me a pair of blue gloves . I did not want blue , but she said they would look very pretty on a hand like mine . I glanced furtively at my hand , and somehow it did seem rather a comely member . I tried a glove on my left and blushed a little . Manifestly the size was too small for me . But I felt gratified when she said : “ Oh , it is just right ! ” Yet I knew it was no such thing . I tugged at it diligently , but it was discouraging work . She said : “ Ah ! I see you are accustomed to wearing kid gloves -- but some gentlemen are so awkward about putting them on. ” It was the last compliment I had expected . I only understand putting on the buckskin article perfectly . I made another effort and tore the glove from the base of the thumb into the palm of the hand -- and tried to hide the rent . She kept up her compliments , and I kept up my determination to deserve them or die : “ Ah , you have had experience ! [ A rip down the back of the hand . ] They are just right for you -- your hand is very small -- if they tear you need not pay for them . [ A rent across the middle . ] I can always tell when a gentleman understands putting on kid gloves . There is a grace about it that only comes with long practice. ” The whole after-guard of the glove “ fetched away , ” as the sailors say , the fabric parted across the knuckles , and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin . I was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise on the angel 's hands . I was hot , vexed , confused , but still happy ; but I hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the proceedings . I wished they were in Jericho . I felt exquisitely mean when I said cheerfully : “ This one does very well ; it fits elegantly . I like a glove that fits . No , never mind , ma'am , never mind ; I 'll put the other on in the street . It is warm here. ” It was warm . It was the warmest place I ever was in . I paid the bill , and as I passed out with a fascinating bow I thought I detected a light in the woman 's eye that was gently ironical ; and when I looked back from the street , and she was laughing all to herself about something or other , I said to myself with withering sarcasm , “ Oh , certainly ; you know how to put on kid gloves , do n't you ? A self-complacent ass , ready to be flattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take the trouble to do it ! ” The silence of the boys annoyed me . Finally Dan said musingly : “ Some gentlemen do n't know how to put on kid gloves at all , but some do. ” And the doctor said ( to the moon , I thought ) : “ But it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on kid gloves. ” Dan soliloquized after a pause : “ Ah , yes ; there is a grace about it that only comes with long , very long practice. ” “ Yes , indeed , I 've noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like he was dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail , he understands putting on kid gloves ; he 's had ex -- ” “ Boys , enough of a thing 's enough ! You think you are very smart , I suppose , but I do n't . And if you go and tell any of those old gossips in the ship about this thing , I 'll never forgive you for it ; that 's all. ” They let me alone then for the time being . We always let each other alone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke . But they had bought gloves , too , as I did . We threw all the purchases away together this morning . They were coarse , unsubstantial , freckled all over with broad yellow splotches , and could neither stand wear nor public exhibition . We had entertained an angel unawares , but we did not take her in . She did that for us . Tangier ! A tribe of stalwart Moors are wading into the sea to carry us ashore on their backs from the small boats . CHAPTER VIII . This is royal ! Let those who went up through Spain make the best of it -- these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco suit our little party well enough . We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present . Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time . Elsewhere we have found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people , but always with things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before , and so the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force . We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign -- foreign from top to bottom -- foreign from center to circumference -- foreign inside and outside and all around -- nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness -- nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun . And lo ! In Tangier we have found it . Here is not the slightest thing that ever we have seen save in pictures -- and we always mistrusted the pictures before . We can not anymore . The pictures used to seem exaggerations -- they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality . But behold , they were not wild enough -- they were not fanciful enough -- they have not told half the story . Tangier is a foreign land if ever there was one , and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book save The Arabian Nights . Here are no white men visible , yet swarms of humanity are all about us . Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in a massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old . All the houses nearly are one-and two-story , made of thick walls of stone , plastered outside , square as a dry-goods box , flat as a floor on top , no cornices , whitewashed all over -- a crowded city of snowy tombs ! And the doors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures ; the floors are laid in varicolored diamond flags ; in tesselated , many-colored porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez ; in red tiles and broad bricks that time can not wear ; there is no furniture in the rooms ( of Jewish dwellings ) save divans -- what there is in Moorish ones no man may know ; within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter . And the streets are oriental -- some of them three feet wide , some six , but only two that are over a dozen ; a man can blockade the most of them by extending his body across them . Is n't it an oriental picture ? There are stalwart Bedouins of the desert here , and stately Moors proud of a history that goes back to the night of time ; and Jews whose fathers fled hither centuries upon centuries ago ; and swarthy Riffians from the mountains -- born cut-throats -- and original , genuine Negroes as black as Moses ; and howling dervishes and a hundred breeds of Arabs -- all sorts and descriptions of people that are foreign and curious to look upon . And their dresses are strange beyond all description . Here is a bronzed Moor in a prodigious white turban , curiously embroidered jacket , gold and crimson sash , of many folds , wrapped round and round his waist , trousers that only come a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuff in them , ornamented scimitar , bare shins , stockingless feet , yellow slippers , and gun of preposterous length -- a mere soldier ! -- I thought he was the Emperor at least . And here are aged Moors with flowing white beards and long white robes with vast cowls ; and Bedouins with long , cowled , striped cloaks ; and Negroes and Riffians with heads clean-shaven except a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or , rather , upon the after corner of the skull ; and all sorts of barbarians in all sorts of weird costumes , and all more or less ragged . And here are Moorish women who are enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes , and whose sex can only be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible and never look at men of their own race , or are looked at by them in public . Here are five thousand Jews in blue gabardines , sashes about their waists , slippers upon their feet , little skullcaps upon the backs of their heads , hair combed down on the forehead , and cut straight across the middle of it from side to side -- the selfsame fashion their Tangier ancestors have worn for I do n't know how many bewildering centuries . Their feet and ankles are bare . Their noses are all hooked , and hooked alike . They all resemble each other so much that one could almost believe they were of one family . Their women are plump and pretty , and do smile upon a Christian in a way which is in the last degree comforting . What a funny old town it is ! It seems like profanation to laugh and jest and bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics . Only the stately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophet are suited to a venerable antiquity like this . Here is a crumbling wall that was old when Columbus discovered America ; was old when Peter the Hermit roused the knightly men of the Middle Ages to arm for the first Crusade ; was old when Charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchanted castles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the olden time ; was old when Christ and his disciples walked the earth ; stood where it stands today when the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought and sold in the streets of ancient Thebes ! The Phoenicians , the Carthagenians , the English , Moors , Romans , all have battled for Tangier -- all have won it and lost it . Here is a ragged , oriental-looking Negro from some desert place in interior Africa , filling his goatskin with water from a stained and battered fountain built by the Romans twelve hundred years ago . Yonder is a ruined arch of a bridge built by Julius Caesar nineteen hundred years ago . Men who had seen the infant Saviour in the Virgin 's arms have stood upon it , maybe . Near it are the ruins of a dockyard where Caesar repaired his ships and loaded them with grain when he invaded Britain , fifty years before the Christian era . Here , under the quiet stars , these old streets seem thronged with the phantoms of forgotten ages . My eyes are resting upon a spot where stood a monument which was seen and described by Roman historians less than two thousand years ago , whereon was inscribed : “ WE ARE THE CANAANITES . WE ARE THEY THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE LAND OF CANAAN BY THE JEWISH ROBBER , JOSHUA. ” Joshua drove them out , and they came here . Not many leagues from here is a tribe of Jews whose ancestors fled thither after an unsuccessful revolt against King David , and these their descendants are still under a ban and keep to themselves . Tangier has been mentioned in history for three thousand years . And it was a town , though a queer one , when Hercules , clad in his lion skin , landed here , four thousand years ago . In these streets he met Anitus , the king of the country , and brained him with his club , which was the fashion among gentlemen in those days . The people of Tangier ( called Tingis then ) lived in the rudest possible huts and dressed in skins and carried clubs , and were as savage as the wild beasts they were constantly obliged to war with . But they were a gentlemanly race and did no work . They lived on the natural products of the land . Their king 's country residence was at the famous Garden of Hesperides , seventy miles down the coast from here . The garden , with its golden apples ( oranges ) , is gone now -- no vestige of it remains . Antiquarians concede that such a personage as Hercules did exist in ancient times and agree that he was an enterprising and energetic man , but decline to believe him a good , bona-fide god , because that would be unconstitutional . Down here at Cape Spartel is the celebrated cave of Hercules , where that hero took refuge when he was vanquished and driven out of the Tangier country . It is full of inscriptions in the dead languages , which fact makes me think Hercules could not have traveled much , else he would not have kept a journal . Five days ' journey from here -- say two hundred miles -- are the ruins of an ancient city , of whose history there is neither record nor tradition . And yet its arches , its columns , and its statues proclaim it to have been built by an enlightened race . The general size of a store in Tangier is about that of an ordinary shower bath in a civilized land . The Muhammadan merchant , tinman , shoemaker , or vendor of trifles sits cross-legged on the floor and reaches after any article you may want to buy . You can rent a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month . The scene is lively , is picturesque , and smells like a police court . The Jewish money-changers have their dens close at hand , and all day long are counting bronze coins and transferring them from one bushel basket to another . They do n't coin much money nowadays , I think . I saw none but what was dated four or five hundred years back , and was badly worn and battered . These coins are not very valuable . Jack went out to get a napoleon changed , so as to have money suited to the general cheapness of things , and came back and said he had “ swamped the bank , had bought eleven quarts of coin , and the head of the firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the change. ” I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling myself . I am not proud on account of having so much money , though . I care nothing for wealth . The Moors have some small silver coins and also some silver slugs worth a dollar each . The latter are exceedingly scarce -- so much so that when poor ragged Arabs see one they beg to be allowed to kiss it . They have also a small gold coin worth two dollars . And that reminds me of something . When Morocco is in a state of war , Arab couriers carry letters through the country and charge a liberal postage . Every now and then they fall into the hands of marauding bands and get robbed . Therefore , warned by experience , as soon as they have collected two dollars ' worth of money they exchange it for one of those little gold pieces , and when robbers come upon them , swallow it . The stratagem was good while it was unsuspected , but after that the marauders simply gave the sagacious United States mail an emetic and sat down to wait . The Emperor of Morocco is a soulless despot , and the great officers under him are despots on a smaller scale . There is no regular system of taxation , but when the Emperor or the Bashaw want money , they levy on some rich man , and he has to furnish the cash or go to prison . Therefore , few men in Morocco dare to be rich . It is too dangerous a luxury . Vanity occasionally leads a man to display wealth , but sooner or later the Emperor trumps up a charge against him -- any sort of one will do -- and confiscates his property . Of course , there are many rich men in the empire , but their money is buried , and they dress in rags and counterfeit poverty . Every now and then the Emperor imprisons a man who is suspected of the crime of being rich , and makes things so uncomfortable for him that he is forced to discover where he has hidden his money . Moors and Jews sometimes place themselves under the protection of the foreign consuls , and then they can flout their riches in the Emperor's face with impunity . CHAPTER IX . About the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon , after landing here , came near finishing that heedless Blucher . We had just mounted some mules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the stately , the princely , the magnificent Hadji Muhammad Lamarty ( may his tribe increase ! ) when we came upon a fine Moorish mosque , with tall tower , rich with checker-work of many-colored porcelain , and every part and portion of the edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the Alhambra , and Blucher started to ride into the open doorway . A startling “ Hi-hi ! ” from our camp followers and a loud “ Halt ! ” from an English gentleman in the party checked the adventurer , and then we were informed that so dire a profanation is it for a Christian dog to set foot upon the sacred threshold of a Moorish mosque that no amount of purification can ever make it fit for the faithful to pray in again . Had Blucher succeeded in entering the place , he would no doubt have been chased through the town and stoned ; and the time has been , and not many years ago , either , when a Christian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if captured in a mosque . We caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated pavements within and of the devotees performing their ablutions at the fountains , but even that we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the Moorish bystanders . Some years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order . The Moors of Tangier have so degenerated that it has been long since there was an artificer among them capable of curing so delicate a patient as a debilitated clock . The great men of the city met in solemn conclave to consider how the difficulty was to be met . They discussed the matter thoroughly but arrived at no solution . Finally , a patriarch arose and said : “ Oh , children of the Prophet , it is known unto you that a Portuguee dog of a Christian clock mender pollutes the city of Tangier with his presence . Ye know , also , that when mosques are builded , asses bear the stones and the cement , and cross the sacred threshold . Now , therefore , send the Christian dog on all fours , and barefoot , into the holy place to mend the clock , and let him go as an ass ! ” And in that way it was done . Therefore , if Blucher ever sees the inside of a mosque , he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in his natural character . We visited the jail and found Moorish prisoners making mats and baskets . ( This thing of utilizing crime savors of civilization . ) Murder is punished with death . A short time ago three murderers were taken beyond the city walls and shot . In this instance they set up the poor criminals at long range , like so many targets , and practiced on them -- kept them hopping about and dodging bullets for half an hour before they managed to drive the center . Their surgery is not artistic . They slice around the bone a little , then break off the limb . Sometimes the patient gets well ; but , as a general thing , he do n't . However , the Moorish heart is stout . The Moors were always brave . These criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince , without a tremor of any kind , without a groan ! No amount of suffering can bring down the pride of a Moor or make him shame his dignity with a cry . Here , marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it . There are no valentines , no stolen interviews , no riding out , no courting in dim parlors , no lovers ' quarrels and reconciliations -- no nothing that is proper to approaching matrimony . The young man takes the girl his father selects for him , marries her , and after that she is unveiled , and he sees her for the first time . If after due acquaintance she suits him , he retains her ; but if he suspects her purity , he bundles her back to her father ; if he finds her diseased , the same ; or if , after just and reasonable time is allowed her , she neglects to bear children , back she goes to the home of her childhood . Muhammadans here who can afford it keep a good many wives on hand . They are called wives , though I believe the Koran only allows four genuine wives -- the rest are concubines . The Emperor of Morocco do n't know how many wives he has , but thinks he has five hundred . However , that is near enough -- a dozen or so , one way or the other , do n't matter . Even the Jews in the interior have a plurality of wives . I have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish women ( for they are only human , and will expose their faces for the admiration of a Christian dog when no male Moor is by ) , and I am full of veneration for the wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness . They carry their children at their backs , in a sack , like other savages the world over . Many of the Negroes are held in slavery by the Moors . But the moment a female slave becomes her master 's concubine her bonds are broken , and as soon as a male slave can read the first chapter of the Koran ( which contains the creed ) he can no longer be held in bondage . They have three Sundays a week in Tangier . The Muhammadans ' comes on Friday , the Jews ' on Saturday , and that of the Christian Consuls on Sunday . The Jews are the most radical . The Moor goes to his mosque about noon on his Sabbath , as on any other day , removes his shoes at the door , performs his ablutions , makes his salaams , pressing his forehead to the pavement time and again , says his prayers , and goes back to his work . But the Jew shuts up shop ; will not touch copper or bronze money at all ; soils his fingers with nothing meaner than silver and gold ; attends the synagogue devoutly ; will not cook or have anything to do with fire ; and religiously refrains from embarking in any enterprise . The Moor who has made a pilgrimage to Mecca is entitled to high distinction . Men call him Hadji , and he is thenceforward a great personage . Hundreds of Moors come to Tangier every year and embark for Mecca . They go part of the way in English steamers , and the ten or twelve dollars they pay for passage is about all the trip costs . They take with them a quantity of food , and when the commissary department fails they “ skirmish , ” as Jack terms it in his sinful , slangy way . From the time they leave till they get home again , they never wash , either on land or sea . They are usually gone from five to seven months , and as they do not change their clothes during all that time , they are totally unfit for the drawing room when they get back . Many of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather together the ten dollars their steamer passage costs , and when one of them gets back he is a bankrupt forever after . Few Moors can ever build up their fortunes again in one short lifetime after so reckless an outlay . In order to confine the dignity of Hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood and possessions , the Emperor decreed that no man should make the pilgrimage save bloated aristocrats who were worth a hundred dollars in specie . But behold how iniquity can circumvent the law ! For a consideration , the Jewish money-changer lends the pilgrim one hundred dollars long enough for him to swear himself through , and then receives it back before the ship sails out of the harbor ! Spain is the only nation the Moors fear . The reason is that Spain sends her heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these Muslims , while America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a gunboat occasionally . The Moors , like other savages , learn by what they see , not what they hear or read . We have great fleets in the Mediterranean , but they seldom touch at African ports . The Moors have a small opinion of England , France , and America , and put their representatives to a deal of red-tape circumlocution before they grant them their common rights , let alone a favor . But the moment the Spanish minister makes a demand , it is acceded to at once , whether it be just or not . Spain chastised the Moors five or six years ago , about a disputed piece of property opposite Gibraltar , and captured the city of Tetouan . She compromised on an augmentation of her territory , twenty million dollars' indemnity in money , and peace . And then she gave up the city . But she never gave it up until the Spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats . They would not compromise as long as the cats held out . Spaniards are very fond of cats . On the contrary , the Moors reverence cats as something sacred . So the Spaniards touched them on a tender point that time . Their unfeline conduct in eating up all the Tetouan cats aroused a hatred toward them in the breasts of the Moors , to which even the driving them out of Spain was tame and passionless . Moors and Spaniards are foes forever now . France had a minister here once who embittered the nation against him in the most innocent way . He killed a couple of battalions of cats ( Tangier is full of them ) and made a parlor carpet out of their hides . He made his carpet in circles -- first a circle of old gray tomcats , with their tails all pointing toward the center ; then a circle of yellow cats ; next a circle of black cats and a circle of white ones ; then a circle of all sorts of cats ; and , finally , a centerpiece of assorted kittens . It was very beautiful , but the Moors curse his memory to this day . When we went to call on our American Consul General today I noticed that all possible games for parlor amusement seemed to be represented on his center tables . I thought that hinted at lonesomeness . The idea was correct . His is the only American family in Tangier . There are many foreign consuls in this place , but much visiting is not indulged in . Tangier is clear out of the world , and what is the use of visiting when people have nothing on earth to talk about ? There is none . So each consul 's family stays at home chiefly and amuses itself as best it can . Tangier is full of interest for one day , but after that it is a weary prison . The Consul General has been here five years , and has got enough of it to do him for a century , and is going home shortly . His family seize upon their letters and papers when the mail arrives , read them over and over again for two days or three , talk them over and over again for two or three more till they wear them out , and after that for days together they eat and drink and sleep , and ride out over the same old road , and see the same old tiresome things that even decades of centuries have scarcely changed , and say never a single word ! They have literally nothing whatever to talk about . The arrival of an American man-of-war is a godsend to them . “ O Solitude , where are the charms which sages have seen in thy face ? ” It is the completest exile that I can conceive of . I would seriously recommend to the government of the United States that when a man commits a crime so heinous that the law provides no adequate punishment for it , they make him Consul General to Tangier . I am glad to have seen Tangier -- the second-oldest town in the world . But I am ready to bid it good-bye , I believe . We shall go hence to Gibraltar this evening or in the morning , and doubtless the Quaker City will sail from that port within the next forty-eight hours . CHAPTER X . We passed the Fourth of July on board the Quaker City , in mid-ocean . It was in all respects a characteristic Mediterranean day -- faultlessly beautiful . A cloudless sky ; a refreshing summer wind ; a radiant sunshine that glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested mountains of water ; a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue , so richly , brilliantly blue , that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with the spell of its fascination . They even have fine sunsets on the Mediterranean -- a thing that is certainly rare in most quarters of the globe . The evening we sailed away from Gibraltar , that hard-featured rock was swimming in a creamy mist so rich , so soft , so enchantingly vague and dreamy , that even the Oracle , that serene , that inspired , that overpowering humbug , scorned the dinner gong and tarried to worship ! He said : “ Well , that 's gorgis , ai n't it ! They do n't have none of them things in our parts , do they ? I consider that them effects is on account of the superior refragability , as you may say , of the sun 's diramic combination with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of Jubiter . What should you think ? ” “ Oh , go to bed ! ” Dan said that , and went away . “ Oh , yes , it 's all very well to say go to bed when a man makes an argument which another man ca n't answer . Dan do n't never stand any chance in an argument with me . And he knows it , too . What should you say , Jack ? ” “ Now , Doctor , do n't you come bothering around me with that dictionary bosh . I do n't do you any harm , do I ? Then you let me alone. ” “ He 's gone , too . Well , them fellows have all tackled the old Oracle , as they say , but the old man 's most too many for 'em . Maybe the Poet Lariat ai n't satisfied with them deductions ? ” The poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below . “ 'Pears that he ca n't qualify , neither . Well , I did n't expect nothing out of him . I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything . He 'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush about that old rock and give it to a consul , or a pilot , or a nigger , or anybody he comes across first which he can impose on . Pity but somebody 'd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out of him . Why ca n't a man put his intellect onto things that 's some value ? Gibbons , and Hippocratus , and Sarcophagus , and all them old ancient philosophers was down on poets -- ” “ Doctor , ” I said , “ you are going to invent authorities now and I 'll leave you , too . I always enjoy your conversation , notwithstanding the luxuriance of your syllables , when the philosophy you offer rests on your own responsibility ; but when you begin to soar -- when you begin to support it with the evidence of authorities who are the creations of your own fancy -- I lose confidence. ” That was the way to flatter the doctor . He considered it a sort of acknowledgment on my part of a fear to argue with him . He was always persecuting the passengers with abstruse propositions framed in language that no man could understand , and they endured the exquisite torture a minute or two and then abandoned the field . A triumph like this , over half a dozen antagonists was sufficient for one day ; from that time forward he would patrol the decks beaming blandly upon all comers , and so tranquilly , blissfully happy ! But I digress . The thunder of our two brave cannon announced the Fourth of July , at daylight , to all who were awake . But many of us got our information at a later hour , from the almanac . All the flags were sent aloft except half a dozen that were needed to decorate portions of the ship below , and in a short time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance . During the morning , meetings were held and all manner of committees set to work on the celebration ceremonies . In the afternoon the ship's company assembled aft , on deck , under the awnings ; the flute , the asthmatic melodeon , and the consumptive clarinet crippled “ The Star-Spangled Banner , ” the choir chased it to cover , and George came in with a peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note and slaughtered it . Nobody mourned . We carried out the corpse on three cheers ( that joke was not intentional and I do not endorse it ) , and then the President , throned behind a cable locker with a national flag spread over it , announced the “ Reader , ” who rose up and read that same old Declaration of Independence which we have all listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said ; and after that the President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters and he made that same old speech about our national greatness which we so religiously believe and so fervently applaud . Now came the choir into court again , with the complaining instruments , and assaulted “ Hail Columbia ” ; and when victory hung wavering in the scale , George returned with his dreadful wild-goose stop turned on and the choir won , of course . A minister pronounced the benediction , and the patriotic little gathering disbanded . The Fourth of July was safe , as far as the Mediterranean was concerned . At dinner in the evening , a well-written original poem was recited with spirit by one of the ship 's captains , and thirteen regular toasts were washed down with several baskets of champagne . The speeches were bad -- execrable almost without exception . In fact , without any exception but one . Captain Duncan made a good speech ; he made the only good speech of the evening . He said : “ LADIES AND GENTLEMEN : -- May we all live to a green old age and be prosperous and happy . Steward , bring up another basket of champagne. ” It was regarded as a very able effort . The festivities , so to speak , closed with another of those miraculous balls on the promenade deck . We were not used to dancing on an even keel , though , and it was only a questionable success . But take it all together , it was a bright , cheerful , pleasant Fourth . Toward nightfall the next evening , we steamed into the great artificial harbor of this noble city of Marseilles , and saw the dying sunlight gild its clustering spires and ramparts , and flood its leagues of environing verdure with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the white villas that flecked the landscape far and near . [ Copyright secured according to law . ] There were no stages out , and we could not get on the pier from the ship . It was annoying . We were full of enthusiasm -- we wanted to see France ! Just at nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for the privilege of using his boat as a bridge -- its stern was at our companion ladder and its bow touched the pier . We got in and the fellow backed out into the harbor . I told him in French that all we wanted was to walk over his thwarts and step ashore , and asked him what he went away out there for . He said he could not understand me . I repeated . Still he could not understand . He appeared to be very ignorant of French . The doctor tried him , but he could not understand the doctor . I asked this boatman to explain his conduct , which he did ; and then I couldn't understand him . Dan said : “ Oh , go to the pier , you old fool -- that 's where we want to go ! ” We reasoned calmly with Dan that it was useless to speak to this foreigner in English -- that he had better let us conduct this business in the French language and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was . “ Well , go on , go on , ” he said , “ do n't mind me . I do n't wish to interfere . Only , if you go on telling him in your kind of French , he never will find out where we want to go to . The Frenchman spoke again , and the doctor said : “ There now , Dan , he says he is going to allez to the douain . Means he is going to the hotel . Oh , certainly -- we do n't know the French language. ” This was a crusher , as Jack would say . It silenced further criticism from the disaffected member . We coasted past the sharp bows of a navy of great steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone pier . It was easy to remember then that the douain was the customhouse and not the hotel . We did not mention it , however . With winning French politeness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels , declined to examine our passports , and sent us on our way . We stopped at the first cafe we came to and entered . An old woman seated us at a table and waited for orders . The doctor said : “ Avez-vous du vin ? ” The dame looked perplexed . The doctor said again , with elaborate distinctness of articulation : “ Avez-vous du -- vin ! ” The dame looked more perplexed than before . I said : “ Doctor , there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere . Let me try her . Madame , avez-vous du vin ? -- It is n't any use , Doctor -- take the witness. ” “ Madame , avez-vous du vin -- du fromage -- pain -- pickled pigs ' feet -- beurre -- des oeufs -- du boeuf -- horseradish , sauerkraut , hog and hominy -- anything , anything in the world that can stay a Christian stomach ! ” She said : “ Bless you , why did n't you speak English before ? I do n't know anything about your plagued French ! ” The humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled the supper , and we dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could . Here we were in beautiful France -- in a vast stone house of quaint architecture -- surrounded by all manner of curiously worded French signs -- stared at by strangely habited , bearded French people -- everything gradually and surely forcing upon us the coveted consciousness that at last , and beyond all question , we were in beautiful France and absorbing its nature to the forgetfulness of everything else , and coming to feel the happy romance of the thing in all its enchanting delightfulness -- and to think of this skinny veteran intruding with her vile English , at such a moment , to blow the fair vision to the winds ! It was exasperating . We set out to find the centre of the city , inquiring the direction every now and then . We never did succeed in making anybody understand just exactly what we wanted , and neither did we ever succeed in comprehending just exactly what they said in reply , but then they always pointed -- they always did that -- and we bowed politely and said , “ Merci , monsieur , ” and so it was a blighting triumph over the disaffected member anyway . He was restive under these victories and often asked : “ What did that pirate say ? ” “ Why , he told us which way to go to find the Grand Casino. ” “ Yes , but what did he say ? ” “ Oh , it do n't matter what he said -- we understood him . These are educated people -- not like that absurd boatman. ” “ Well , I wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction that goes some where -- for we 've been going around in a circle for an hour . I 've passed this same old drugstore seven times. ” We said it was a low , disreputable falsehood ( but we knew it was not ) . It was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again , though -- we might go on asking directions , but we must cease from following finger-pointings if we hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffected member . A long walk through smooth , asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks of vast new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and every block precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for a mile , and all brilliantly lighted -- brought us at last to the principal thoroughfare . On every hand were bright colors , flashing constellations of gas burners , gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks -- hurry , life , activity , cheerfulness , conversation , and laughter everywhere ! We found the Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix , and wrote down who we were , where we were born , what our occupations were , the place we came from last , whether we were married or single , how we liked it , how old we were , where we were bound for and when we expected to get there , and a great deal of information of similar importance -- all for the benefit of the landlord and the secret police . We hired a guide and began the business of sightseeing immediately . That first night on French soil was a stirring one . I can not think of half the places we went to or what we particularly saw ; we had no disposition to examine carefully into anything at all -- we only wanted to glance and go -- to move ,",The Innocents Abroad
Thomas Hardy,"to English people , either . I wonder who this M. de la Feste is , in whom Caroline says my mother is so much interested . July 18. -- Another letter from Caroline . I have learnt from this epistle , that M. Charles de la Feste is 'only one of the many friends of the Marlets ' ; that though a Frenchman by birth , and now again temporarily at Versailles , he has lived in England many many years ; that he is a talented landscape and marine painter , and has exhibited at the Salon , and I think in London . His style and subjects are considered somewhat peculiar in Paris -- rather English than Continental . I have not as yet learnt his age , or his condition , married or single . From the tone and nature of her remarks about him he sometimes seems to be a middle-aged family man , sometimes quite the reverse . From his nomadic habits I should say the latter is the most likely . He has travelled and seen a great deal , she tells me , and knows more about English literature than she knows herself . July 21. -- Letter from Caroline . Query : Is ' a friend of ours and the Marlets , ' of whom she now anonymously and mysteriously speaks , the same personage as the 'M . de la Feste ' of her former letters ? He must be the same , I think , from his pursuits . If so , whence this sudden change of tone ? . . . I have been lost in thought for at least a quarter of an hour since writing the preceding sentence . Suppose my dear sister is falling in love with this young man -- there is no longer any doubt about his age ; what a very awkward , risky thing for her ! I do hope that my mother has an eye on these proceedings . But , then , poor mother never sees the drift of anything : she is in truth less of a mother to Caroline than I am . If I were there , how jealously I would watch him , and ascertain his designs ! I am of a stronger nature than Caroline . How I have supported her in the past through her little troubles and great griefs ! Is she agitated at the presence of this , to her , new and strange feeling ? But I am assuming her to be desperately in love , when I have no proof of anything of the kind . He may be merely a casual friend , of whom I shall hear no more . July 24. -- Then he is a bachelor , as I suspected . 'If M. de la Feste ever marries he will , ' etc . So she writes . They are getting into close quarters , obviously . Also , 'Something to keep my hair smooth , which M. de la Feste told me he had found useful for the tips of his moustache . ' Very naively related this ; and with how much unconsciousness of the intimacy between them that the remark reveals ! But my mother -- what can she be doing ? Does she know of this ? And if so , why does she not allude to it in her letters to my father ? . . . I have been to look at Caroline 's pony , in obedience to her reiterated request that I would not miss a day in seeing that she was well cared for . Anxious as Caroline was about this pony of hers before starting , she now never mentioned the poor animal once in her letters . The image of her pet suffers from displacement . August 3. -- Caroline 's forgetfulness of her pony has naturally enough extended to me , her sister . It is ten days since she last wrote , and but for a note from my mother I should not know if she were dead or alive . CHAPTER II. -- NEWS INTERESTING AND SERIOUS August 5. -- A cloud of letters . A letter from Caroline , another from mother ; also one from each to my father . The probability to which all the intelligence from my sister has pointed of late turns out to be a fact . There is an engagement , or almost an engagement , announced between my dear Caroline and M. de la Feste -- to Caroline 's sublime happiness , and my mother 's entire satisfaction ; as well as to that of the Marlets . They and my mother seem to know all about the young man -- which is more than I do , though a little extended information about him , considering that I am Caroline 's elder sister , would not have been amiss . I half feel with my father , who is much surprised , and , I am sure , not altogether satisfied , that he should not have been consulted at all before matters reached such a definite stage , though he is too amiable to say so openly . I do n't quite say that a good thing should have been hindered for the sake of our opinion , if it is a good thing ; but the announcement comes very suddenly . It must have been foreseen by my mother for some time that this upshot was probable , and Caroline might have told me more distinctly that M. de la Feste was her lover , instead of alluding so mysteriously to him as only a friend of the Marlets , and lately dropping his name altogether . My father , without exactly objecting to him as a Frenchman , 'wishes he were of English or some other reasonable nationality for one 's son-in-law , ' but I tell him that the demarcations of races , kingdoms , and creeds , are wearing down every day , that patriotism is a sort of vice , and that the character of the individual is all we need think about in this case . I wonder if , in the event of their marriage , he will continue to live at Versailles , or if he will come to England . August 7. -- A supplemental letter from Caroline , answering , by anticipation , some of the aforesaid queries . She tells me that 'Charles , ' though he makes Versailles his present home , is by no means bound by his profession to continue there ; that he will live just where she wishes , provided it be not too far from some centre of thought , art , and civilization . My mother and herself both think that the marriage should not take place till next year . He exhibits landscapes and canal scenery every year , she says ; so I suppose he is popular , and that his income is sufficient to keep them in comfort . If not , I do not see why my father could not settle something more on them than he had intended , and diminish by a little what he had proposed for me , whilst it was imagined that I should be the first to stand in need of such . 'Of engaging manner , attractive appearance , and virtuous character , ' is the reply I receive from her in answer to my request for a personal description . That is vague enough , and I would rather have had one definite fact of complexion , voice , deed , or opinion . But of course she has no eye now for material qualities ; she can not see him as he is . She sees him irradiated with glories such as never appertained and never will appertain to any man , foreign , English , or Colonial . To think that Caroline , two years my junior , and so childlike as to be five years my junior in nature , should be engaged to be married before me . But that is what happens in families more often than we are apt to remember . August 16. -- Interesting news to-day . Charles , she says , has pleaded that their marriage may just as well be this year as next ; and he seems to have nearly converted my mother to the same way of thinking . I do not myself see any reason for delay , beyond the standing one of my father having as yet had no opportunity of forming an opinion upon the man , the time , or anything . However , he takes his lot very quietly , and they are coming home to talk the question over with us ; Caroline having decided not to make any positive arrangements for this change of state till she has seen me . Subject to my own and my father 's approval , she says , they are inclined to settle the date of the wedding for November , three months from the present time , that it shall take place here in the village , that I , of course , shall be bridesmaid , and many other particulars . She draws an artless picture of the probable effect upon the minds of the villagers of this romantic performance in the chancel of our old church , in which she is to be chief actor -- the foreign gentleman dropping down like a god from the skies , picking her up , and triumphantly carrying her off . Her only grief will be separation from me , but this is to be assuaged by my going and staying with her for long months at a time . This simple prattle is very sweet to me , my dear sister , but I can not help feeling sad at the occasion of it . In the nature of things it is obvious that I shall never be to you again what I hitherto have been : your guide , counsellor , and most familiar friend . M. de la Feste does certainly seem to be all that one could desire as protector to a sensitive fragile child like Caroline , and for that I am thankful . Still , I must remember that I see him as yet only through her eyes . For her sake I am intensely anxious to meet him , and scrutinise him through and through , and learn what the man is really made of who is to have such a treasure in his keeping . The engagement has certainly been formed a little precipitately ; I quite agree with my father in that : still , good and happy marriages have been made in a hurry before now , and mother seems well satisfied . August 20. -- A terrible announcement came this morning ; and we are in deep trouble . I have been quite unable to steady my thoughts on anything to- day till now -- half-past eleven at night -- and I only attempt writing these notes because I am too restless to remain idle , and there is nothing but waiting and waiting left for me to do . Mother has been taken dangerously ill at Versailles : they were within a day or two of starting ; but all thought of leaving must now be postponed , for she can not possibly be moved in her present state . I do n't like the sound of haemorrhage at all in a woman of her full habit , and Caroline and the Marlets have not exaggerated their accounts I am certain . On the receipt of the letter my father instantly decided to go to her , and I have been occupied all day in getting him off , for as he calculates on being absent several days , there have been many matters for him to arrange before setting out -- the chief being to find some one who will do duty for him next Sunday -- a quest of no small difficulty at such short notice ; but at last poor old feeble Mr. Dugdale has agreed to attempt it , with Mr. Highman , the Scripture reader , to assist him in the lessons . I fain would have gone with my father to escape the irksome anxiety of awaiting her ; but somebody had to stay , and I could best be spared . George has driven him to the station to meet the last train by which he will catch the midnight boat , and reach Havre some time in the morning . He hates the sea , and a night passage in particular . I hope he will get there without mishap of any kind ; but I feel anxious for him , stay-at- home as he is , and unable to cope with any difficulty . Such an errand , too ; the journey will be sad enough at best . I almost think I ought to have been the one to go to her . August 21. -- I nearly fell asleep of heaviness of spirit last night over my writing . My father must have reached Paris by this time ; and now here comes a letter . . . Later. -- The letter was to express an earnest hope that my father had set out . My poor mother is sinking , they fear . What will become of Caroline ? O , how I wish I could see mother ; why could not both have gone ? Later. -- I get up from my chair , and walk from window to window , and then come and write a line . I can not even divine how poor Caroline 's marriage is to be carried out if mother dies . I pray that father may have got there in time to talk to her and receive some directions from her about Caroline and M. de la Feste -- a man whom neither my father nor I have seen . I , who might be useful in this emergency , am doomed to stay here , waiting in suspense . August 23. -- A letter from my father containing the sad news that my mother 's spirit has flown . Poor little Caroline is heart-broken -- she was always more my mother 's pet than I was . It is some comfort to know that my father arrived in time to hear from her own lips her strongly expressed wish that Caroline 's marriage should be solemnized as soon as possible . M. de la Feste seems to have been a great favourite of my dear mother 's ; and I suppose it now becomes almost a sacred duty of my father to accept him as a son-in-law without criticism . CHAPTER III. -- HER GLOOM LIGHTENS A LITTLE September 10. -- I have inserted nothing in my diary for more than a fortnight . Events have been altogether too sad for me to have the spirit to put them on paper . And yet there comes a time when the act of recording one 's trouble is recognized as a welcome method of dwelling upon it . . . My dear mother has been brought home and buried here in the parish . It was not so much her own wish that this should be done as my father 's , who particularly desired that she should lie in the family vault beside his first wife . I saw them side by side before the vault was closed -- two women beloved by one man . As I stood , and Caroline by my side , I fell into a sort of dream , and had an odd fancy that Caroline and I might be also beloved of one , and lie like these together -- an impossibility , of course , being sisters . When I awoke from my reverie Caroline took my hand and said it was time to leave . September 14. -- The wedding is indefinitely postponed . Caroline is like a girl awakening in the middle of a somnambulistic experience , and does not realize where she is , or how she stands . She walks about silently , and I can not tell her thoughts , as I used to do . It was her own doing to write to M. de la Feste and tell him that the wedding could not possibly take place this autumn as originally planned . There is something depressing in this long postponement if she is to marry him at all ; and yet I do not see how it could be avoided . October 20. -- I have had so much to occupy me in consoling Caroline that I have been continually overlooking my diary . Her life was much nearer to my mother 's than mine was . She has never , as I , lived away from home long enough to become self-dependent , and hence in her first loss , and all that it involved , she drooped like a rain-beaten lily . But she is of a nature whose wounds soon heal , even though they may be deep , and the supreme poignancy of her sorrow has already passed . My father is of opinion that the wedding should not be delayed too long . While at Versailles he made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste , and though they had but a short and hurried communion with each other , he was much impressed by M. de la Feste 's disposition and conduct , and is strongly in favour of his suit . It is odd that Caroline 's betrothed should influence in his favour all who come near him . His portrait , which dear Caroline has shown me , exhibits him to be of a physique that partly accounts for this : but there must be something more than mere appearance , and it is probably some sort of glamour or fascinating power -- the quality which prevented Caroline from describing him to me with any accuracy of detail . At the same time , I see from the photograph that his face and head are remarkably well formed ; and though the contours of his mouth are hidden by his moustache , his arched brows show well the romantic disposition of a true lover and painter of Nature . I think that the owner of such a face as this must be tender and sympathetic and true . October 30. -- As my sister 's grief for her mother becomes more and more calmed , her love for M. de la Feste begins to reassume its former absorbing command of her . She thinks of him incessantly , and writes whole treatises to him by way of letters . Her blank disappointment at his announcement of his inability to pay us a visit quite so soon as he had promised , was quite tragic . I , too , am disappointed , for I wanted to see and estimate him . But having arranged to go to Holland to seize some aerial effects for his pictures , which are only to be obtained at this time of the autumn , he is obliged to postpone his journey this way , which is now to be made early in the new year . I think myself that he ought to have come at all sacrifices , considering Caroline 's recent loss , the sad postponement of what she was looking forward to , and her single-minded affection for him . Still , who knows ; his professional success is important . Moreover , she is cheerful , and hopeful , and the delay will soon be overpast . CHAPTER IV. -- SHE BEHOLDS THE ATTRACTIVE STRANGER February 16. -- We have had such a dull life here all the winter that I have found nothing important enough to set down , and broke off my journal accordingly . I resume it now to make an entry on the subject of dear Caroline 's future . It seems that she was too grieved , immediately after the loss of our mother , to answer definitely the question of M. de la Feste how long the postponement was to be ; then , afterwards , it was agreed that the matter should be discussed on his autumn visit ; but as he did not come , it has remained in abeyance till this week , when Caroline , with the greatest simplicity and confidence , has written to him without any further pressure on his part , and told him that she is quite ready to fix the time , and will do so as soon as he arrives to see her . She is a little frightened now , lest it should seem forward in her to have revived the subject of her own accord ; but she may assume that his question has been waiting on for an answer ever since , and that she has , therefore , acted only within her promise . In truth , the secret at the bottom of it all is that she is somewhat saddened because he has not latterly reminded her of the pause in their affairs -- that , in short , his original impatience to possess her is not now found to animate him so obviously . I suppose that he loves her as much as ever ; indeed , I am sure he must do so , seeing how lovable she is . It is mostly thus with all men when women are out of their sight ; they grow negligent . Caroline must have patience , and remember that a man of his genius has many and important calls upon his time . In justice to her I must add that she does remember it fairly well , and has as much patience as any girl ever had in the circumstances . He hopes to come at the beginning of April at latest . Well , when he comes we shall see him . April 5. -- I think that what M. de la Feste writes is reasonable enough , though Caroline looks heart-sick about it . It is hardly worth while for him to cross all the way to England and back just now , while the sea is so turbulent , seeing that he will be obliged , in any event , to come in May , when he has to be in London for professional purposes , at which time he can take us easily on his way both coming and going . When Caroline becomes his wife she will be more practical , no doubt ; but she is such a child as yet that there is no contenting her with reasons . However , the time will pass quickly , there being so much to do in preparing a trousseau for her , which must now be put in hand in order that we may have plenty of leisure to get it ready . On no account must Caroline be married in half-mourning ; I am sure that mother , could she know , would not wish it , and it is odd that Caroline should be so intractably persistent on this point , when she is usually so yielding . April 30. -- This month has flown on swallow 's wings . We are in a great state of excitement -- I as much as she -- I can not quite tell why . He is really coming in ten days , he says . May 9 . Four p.m. -- I am so agitated I can scarcely write , and yet am particularly impelled to do so before leaving my room . It is the unexpected shape of an expected event which has caused my absurd excitement , which proves me almost as much a school-girl as Caroline . M. de la Feste was not , as we understood , to have come till to-morrow ; but he is here -- just arrived . All household directions have devolved upon me , for my father , not thinking M. de la Feste would appear before us for another four-and-twenty hours , left home before post time to attend a distant consecration ; and hence Caroline and I were in no small excitement when Charles 's letter was opened , and we read that he had been unexpectedly favoured in the dispatch of his studio work , and would follow his letter in a few hours . We sent the covered carriage to meet the train indicated , and waited like two newly strung harps for the first sound of the returning wheels . At last we heard them on the gravel ; and the question arose who was to receive him . It was , strictly speaking , my duty ; but I felt timid ; I could not help shirking it , and insisted that Caroline should go down . She did not , however , go near the door as she usually does when anybody is expected , but waited palpitating in the drawing-room . He little thought when he saw the silent hall , and the apparently deserted house , how that house was at the very same moment alive and throbbing with interest under the surface . I stood at the back of the upper landing , where nobody could see me from downstairs , and heard him walk across the hall -- a lighter step than my father 's -- and heard him then go into the drawing-room , and the servant shut the door behind him and go away . What a pretty lover 's meeting they must have had in there all to themselves ! Caroline 's sweet face looking up from her black gown -- how it must have touched him . I know she wept very much , for I heard her ; and her eyes will be red afterwards , and no wonder , poor dear , though she is no doubt happy . I can imagine what she is telling him while I write this -- her fears lest anything should have happened to prevent his coming after all -- gentle , smiling reproaches for his long delay ; and things of that sort . His two portmanteaus are at this moment crossing the landing on the way to his room . I wonder if I ought to go down . A little later. -- I have seen him ! It was not at all in the way that I intended to encounter him , and I am vexed . Just after his portmanteaus were brought up I went out from my room to descend , when , at the moment of stepping towards the first stair , my eyes were caught by an object in the hall below , and I paused for an instant , till I saw that it was a bundle of canvas and sticks , composing a sketching tent and easel . At the same nick of time the drawing-room door opened and the affianced pair came out . They were saying they would go into the garden ; and he waited a moment while she put on her hat . My idea was to let them pass on without seeing me , since they seemed not to want my company , but I had got too far on the landing to retreat ; he looked up , and stood staring at me -- engrossed to a dream-like fixity . Thereupon I , too , instead of advancing as I ought to have done , stood moonstruck and awkward , and before I could gather my weak senses sufficiently to descend , she had called him , and they went out by the garden door together . I then thought of following them , but have changed my mind , and come here to jot down these few lines . It is all I am fit for . . . He is even more handsome than I expected . I was right in feeling he must have an attraction beyond that of form : it appeared even in that momentary glance . How happy Caroline ought to be . But I must , of course , go down to be ready with tea in the drawing-room by the time they come indoors . 11 p.m. -- I have made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste ; and I seem to be another woman from the effect of it . I can not describe why this should be so , but conversation with him seems to expand the view , and open the heart , and raise one as upon stilts to wider prospects . He has a good intellectual forehead , perfect eyebrows , dark hair and eyes , an animated manner , and a persuasive voice . His voice is soft in quality -- too soft for a man , perhaps ; and yet on second thoughts I would not have it less so . We have been talking of his art : I had no notion that art demanded such sacrifices or such tender devotion ; or that there were two roads for choice within its precincts , the road of vulgar money-making , and the road of high aims and consequent inappreciation for many long years by the public . That he has adopted the latter need not be said to those who understand him . It is a blessing for Caroline that she has been chosen by such a man , and she ought not to lament at postponements and delays , since they have arisen unavoidably . Whether he finds hers a sufficiently rich nature , intellectually and emotionally , for his own , I know not , but he seems occasionally to be disappointed at her simple views of things . Does he really feel such love for her at this moment as he no doubt believes himself to be feeling , and as he no doubt hopes to feel for the remainder of his life towards her ? It was a curious thing he told me when we were left for a few minutes alone ; that Caroline had alluded so slightly to me in her conversation and letters that he had not realized my presence in the house here at all . But , of course , it was only natural that she should write and talk most about herself . I suppose it was on account of the fact of his being taken in some measure unawares , that I caught him on two or three occasions regarding me fixedly in a way that disquieted me somewhat , having been lately in so little society ; till my glance aroused him from his reverie , and he looked elsewhere in some confusion . It was fortunate that he did so , and thus failed to notice my own . It shows that he , too , is not particularly a society person . May 10. -- Have had another interesting conversation with M. de la Feste on schools of landscape painting in the drawing-room after dinner this evening -- my father having fallen asleep , and left nobody but Caroline and myself for Charles to talk to . I did not mean to say so much to him , and had taken a volume of Modern Painters from the bookcase to occupy myself with , while leaving the two lovers to themselves ; but he would include me in his audience , and I was obliged to lay the book aside . However , I insisted on keeping Caroline in the conversation , though her views on pictorial art were only too charmingly crude and primitive . To-morrow , if fine , we are all three going to Wherryborne Wood , where Charles will give us practical illustrations of the principles of coloring that he has enumerated to-night . I am determined not to occupy his attention to the exclusion of Caroline , and my plan is that when we are in the dense part of the wood I will lag behind , and slip away , and leave them to return by themselves . I suppose the reason of his attentiveness to me lies in his simply wishing to win the good opinion of one who is so closely united to Caroline , and so likely to influence her good opinion of him . May 11 . Late. -- I can not sleep , and in desperation have lit my candle and taken up my pen . My restlessness is occasioned by what has occurred to- day , which at first I did not mean to write down , or trust to any heart but my own . We went to Wherryborne Wood -- Caroline , Charles and I , as we had intended -- and walked all three along the green track through the midst , Charles in the middle between Caroline and myself . Presently I found that , as usual , he and I were the only talkers , Caroline amusing herself by observing birds and squirrels as she walked docilely alongside her betrothed . Having noticed this I dropped behind at the first opportunity and slipped among the trees , in a direction in which I knew I should find another path that would take me home . Upon this track I by and by emerged , and walked along it in silent thought till , at a bend , I suddenly encountered M. de la Feste standing stock still and smiling thoughtfully at me . 'Where is Caroline ? ' said I . 'Only a little way off , ' says he . 'When we missed you from behind us we thought you might have mistaken the direction we had followed , so she has gone one way to find you and I have come this way . ' We then went back to find Caroline , but could not discover her anywhere , and the upshot was that he and I were wandering about the woods alone for more than an hour . On reaching home we found she had given us up after searching a little while , and arrived there some time before . I should not be so disturbed by the incident if I had not perceived that , during her absence from us , he did not make any earnest effort to rediscover her ; and in answer to my repeated expressions of wonder as to whither she could have wandered he only said , 'Oh , she 's quite safe ; she told me she knew the way home from any part of this wood . Let us go on with our talk . I assure you I value this privilege of being with one I so much admire more than you imagine ; ' and other things of that kind . I was so foolish as to show a little perturbation -- I can not tell why I did not control myself ; and I think he noticed that I was not cool . Caroline has , with her simple good faith , thought nothing of the occurrence ; yet altogether I am not satisfied . CHAPTER V. -- HER SITUATION IS A TRYING ONE May 15. -- The more I think of it day after day , the more convinced I am that my suspicions are true . He is too interested in me -- well , in plain words , loves me ; or , not to degrade that phrase , has a wild passion for me ; and his affection for Caroline is that towards a sister only . That is the distressing truth ; how it has come about I can not tell , and it wears upon me . A hundred little circumstances have revealed this to me , and the longer I dwell upon it the more agitating does the consideration become . Heaven only can help me out of the terrible difficulty in which this places me . I have done nothing to encourage him to be faithless to her . I have studiously kept out of his way ; have persistently refused to be a third in their interviews . Yet all to no purpose . Some fatality has seemed to rule , ever since he came to the house , that this disastrous inversion of things should arise . If I had only foreseen the possibility of it before he arrived , how gladly would I have departed on some visit or other to the meanest friend to hinder such an apparent treachery . But I blindly welcomed him -- indeed , made myself particularly agreeable to him for her sake . There is no possibility of my suspicions being wrong ; not until they have reached absolute certainty have I dared even to admit the truth to myself . His conduct to-day would have proved them true had I entertained no previous apprehensions . Some photographs of myself came for me by post , and they were handed round at the breakfast table and criticised . I put them temporarily on a side table , and did not remember them until an hour afterwards when I was in my own room . On going to fetch them I discovered him standing at the table with his back towards the door bending over the photographs , one of which he raised to his lips . The witnessing this act so frightened me that I crept away to escape observation . It was the climax to a series of slight and significant actions all tending to the same conclusion . The question for me now is , what am I to do ? To go away is what first occurs to me , but what reason can I give Caroline and my father for such a step ; besides , it might precipitate some sort of catastrophe by driving Charles to desperation . For the present , therefore , I have decided that I can only wait , though his contiguity is strangely disturbing to me now , and I hardly retain strength of mind to encounter him . How will the distressing complication end ? May 19. -- And so it has come ! My mere avoidance of him has precipitated the worst issue -- a declaration . I had occasion to go into the kitchen garden to gather some of the double ragged-robins which grew in a corner there . Almost as soon as I had entered I heard footsteps without . The door opened and shut , and I turned to behold him just inside it . As the garden is closed by four walls and the gardener was absent , the spot ensured absolute privacy . He came along the path by the asparagus-bed , and overtook me . 'You know why I come , Alicia ? ' said he , in a tremulous voice . I said nothing , and hung my head , for by his tone I did know . 'Yes , ' he went on , 'it is you I love ; my sentiment towards your sister is one of affection too , but protective , tutelary affection -- no more . Say what you will I can not help it . I mistook my feeling for her , and I know how much I am to blame for my want of self-knowledge . I have fought against this discovery night and day ; but it can not be concealed . Why did I ever see you , since I could not see you till I had committed myself ? At the moment my eyes beheld you on that day of my arrival , I said , `` This is the woman for whom my manhood has waited . '' Ever since an unaccountable fascination has riveted my heart to you . Answer one word ! ' ' O , M. de la Feste ! ' I burst out . What I said more I can not remember , but I suppose that the misery I was in showed pretty plainly , for he said , 'Something must be done to let her know ; perhaps I have mistaken her affection , too ; but all depends upon what you feel . ' ' I can not tell what I feel , ' said I , 'except that this seems terrible treachery ; and every moment that I stay with you here makes it worse ! . . . Try to keep faith with her -- her young heart is tender ; believe me there is no mistake in the quality of her love for you . Would there were ! This would kill her if she knew it ! ' He sighed heavily . 'She ought never to be my wife , ' he said . 'Leaving my own happiness out of the question , it would be a cruelty to her to unite her to me . ' I said I could not hear such words from him , and begged him in tears to go away ; he obeyed , and I heard the garden door shut behind him . What is to be the end of the announcement , and the fate of Caroline ? May 20. -- I put a good deal on paper yesterday , and yet not all . I was , in truth , hoping against hope , against conviction , against too conscious self-judgment . I scarcely dare own the truth now , yet it relieves my aching heart to set it down . Yes , I love him -- that is the dreadful fact , and I can no longer parry , evade , or deny it to myself though to the rest of the world it can never be owned . I love Caroline 's betrothed , and he loves me . It is no yesterday 's passion , cultivated by our converse ; it came at first sight , independently of my will ; and my talk with him yesterday made rather against it than for it , but , alas , did not quench it . God forgive us both for this terrible treachery . May 25. -- All is vague ; our courses shapeless . He comes and goes , being occupied , ostensibly at least , with sketching in his tent in the wood . Whether he and she see each other privately I can not tell , but I rather think they do not ; that she sadly awaits him , and he does not appear . Not a sign from him that my repulse has done him any good , or that he will endeavour to keep faith with her . O , if I only had the compulsion of a god , and the self-sacrifice of a martyr ! May 31. -- It has all ended -- or rather this act of the sad drama has ended -- in nothing . He has left us . No day for the fulfilment of the engagement with Caroline is named , my father not being the man to press any one on such a matter , or , indeed , to interfere in any way . We two girls are , in fact , quite defenceless in a case of this kind ; lovers may come when they choose , and desert when they choose ; poor father is too urbane to utter a word of remonstrance or inquiry . Moreover , as the approved of my dead mother , M. de la Feste has a sort of autocratic power with my father , who holds it unkind to her memory to have an opinion about him . I , feeling it my duty , asked M. de la Feste at the last moment about the engagement , in a voice I could not keep firm . 'Since the death of your mother all has been indefinite -- all ! ' he said gloomily . That was the whole . Possibly , Wherryborne Rectory may see him no more . June 7 . -- M . de la Feste has written -- one letter to her , one to me . Hers could not have been very warm , for she did not brighten on reading it . Mine was an ordinary note of friendship , filling an ordinary sheet of paper , which I handed over to Caroline when I had finished looking it through . But there was a scrap of paper in the bottom of the envelope , which I dared not show any one . This scrap is his real letter : I scanned it alone in my room , trembling , hot and cold by turns . He tells me he is very wretched ; that he deplores what has happened , but was helpless . Why did I let him see me , if only to make him faithless . Alas , alas ! June 21 . -- My dear Caroline has lost appetite , spirits , health . Hope deferred maketh the heart sick . His letters to her grow colder -- if indeed he has written more than one . He has refrained from writing again to me -- he knows it is no use . Altogether the situation that he and she and I are in is melancholy in the extreme . Why are human hearts so perverse ? CHAPTER VI. -- HER INGENUITY INSTIGATES HER September 19. -- Three months of anxious care -- till at length I have taken the extreme step of writing to him . Our chief distress has been caused by the state of poor Caroline , who , after sinking by degrees into such extreme weakness as to make it doubtful if she can ever recover full vigour , has to-day been taken much worse . Her position is very critical . The doctor says plainly that she is dying of a broken heart -- and that even the removal of the cause may not now restore her . Ought I to have written to Charles sooner ? But how could I when she forbade me ? It was her pride only which instigated her , and I should not have obeyed . Sept . 26. -- Charles has arrived and has seen her . He is shocked , conscience-stricken , remorseful . I have told him that he can do no good beyond cheering her by his presence . I do not know what he thinks of proposing to her if she gets better , but he says little to her at present : indeed he dares not : his words agitate her dangerously . Sept . 28. -- After a struggle between duty and selfishness , such as I pray to Heaven I may never have to undergo again , I have asked him for pity's sake to make her his wife , here and now , as she lies . I said to him that the poor child would not trouble him long ; and such a solemnization would soothe her last hours as nothing else could do . He said that he would willingly do so , and had thought of it himself ; but for one forbidding reason : in the event of her death as his wife he can never marry me , her sister , according to our laws . I started at his words . He went on : 'On the other hand , if I were sure that immediate marriage with me would save her life , I would not refuse , for possibly I might after a while , and out of sight of you , make myself fairly content with one of so sweet a disposition as hers ; but if , as is probable , neither my marrying her nor any other act can avail to save her life , by so doing I lose both her and you . ' I could not answer him . Sept . 29. -- He continued firm in his reasons for refusal till this morning , and then I became possessed with an idea , which I at once propounded to him . It was that he should at least consent to a form of marriage with Caroline , in consideration of her love ; a form which need not be a legal union , but one which would satisfy her sick and enfeebled soul . Such things have been done , and the sentiment of feeling herself his would inexpressibly comfort her mind , I am sure . Then , if she is taken from us , I should not have lost the power of becoming his lawful wife at some future day , if it indeed should be deemed expedient ; if , on the other hand , she lives , he can on her recovery inform her of the incompleteness of their marriage contract , the ceremony can be repeated , and I can , and I am sure willingly would , avoid troubling them with my presence till grey hairs and wrinkles make his unfortunate passion for me a thing of the past . I put all this before him ; but he demurred . Sept . 30. -- I have urged him again . He says he will consider . It is no time to mince matters , and as a further inducement I have offered to enter into a solemn engagement to marry him myself a year after her death . Sept. 30 . Later. -- An agitating interview . He says he will agree to whatever I propose , the three possibilities and our contingent acts being recorded as follows : First , in the event of dear Caroline being taken from us , I marry him on the expiration of a year : Second , in the forlorn chance of her recovery I take upon myself the responsibility of explaining to Caroline the true nature of the ceremony he has gone through with her , that it was done at my suggestion to make her happy at once , before a special licence could be obtained , and that a public ceremony at church is awaiting her : Third , in the unlikely event of her cooling , and refusing to repeat the ceremony with him , I leave England , join him abroad , and there wed him , agreeing not to live in England again till Caroline has either married another or regards her attachment to Charles as a bygone matter . I have thought over these conditions , and have agreed to them all as they stand . 11 p.m. -- I do not much like this scheme , after all . For one thing , I have just sounded my father on it before parting with him for the night , my impression having been that he would see no objection . But he says he could on no account countenance any such unreal proceeding ; however good our intentions , and even though the poor girl were dying , it would not be right . So I sadly seek my pillow . October 1. -- I am sure my father is wrong in his view . Why is it not right , if it would be balm to Caroline 's wounded soul , and if a real ceremony is absolutely refused by Charles -- moreover is hardly practicable in the difficulty of getting a special licence , if he were agreed ? My father does not know , or will not believe , that Caroline 's attachment has been the cause of her hopeless condition . But that it is so , and that the form of words would give her inexpressible happiness , I know well ; for I whispered tentatively in her ear on such marriages , and the effect was great . Henceforth my father can not be taken into confidence on the subject of Caroline . He does not understand her . 12 o'clock noon. -- I have taken advantage of my father 's absence to-day to confide my secret notion to a thoughtful young man , who called here this morning to speak to my father . He is the Mr. Theophilus Higham , of whom I have already had occasion to speak -- a Scripture reader in the next town , and is soon going to be ordained . I told him the pitiable case , and my remedy . He says ardently that he will assist me -- would do anything for me ( he is , in truth , an admirer of mine ) ; he sees no wrong in such an act of charity . He is coming again to the house this afternoon before my father returns , to carry out the idea . I have spoken to Charles , who promises to be ready . I must now break the news to Caroline . 11 o'clock p.m. -- I have been in too much excitement till now to set down the result . We have accomplished our plan ; and though I feel like a guilty sinner , I am glad . My father , of course , is not to be informed as yet . Caroline has had a seraphic expression upon her wasted , transparent face ever since . I should hardly be surprised if it really saved her life even now , and rendered a legitimate union necessary between them . In that case my father can be informed of the whole proceeding , and in the face of such wonderful success can not disapprove . Meanwhile poor Charles has not lost the possibility of taking unworthy me to fill her place should she -- . But I can not contemplate that alternative unmoved , and will not write it . Charles left for the South of Europe immediately after the ceremony . He was in a high-strung , throbbing , almost wild state of mind at first , but grew calmer under my exhortations . I had to pay the penalty of receiving a farewell kiss from him , which I much regret , considering its meaning ; but he took me so unexpectedly , and in a moment was gone . Oct . 6. -- She certainly is better , and even when she found that Charles had been suddenly obliged to leave , she received the news quite cheerfully . The doctor says that her apparent improvement may be delusive ; but I think our impressing upon her the necessity of keeping what has occurred a secret from papa , and everybody , helps to give her a zest for life . Oct . 8. -- She is still mending . I am glad to have saved her -- my only sister -- if I have done so ; though I shall now never become Charles's wife . CHAPTER VII. -- A SURPRISE AWAITS HER Feb . 5. -- Writing has been absolutely impossible for a long while ; but I now reach a stage at which it seems possible to jot down a line . Caroline 's recovery , extending over four months , has been very engrossing ; at first slow , latterly rapid . But a fearful complication of affairs attends it ! O what a tangled web we weave When first we practise to deceive ! Charles has written reproachfully to me from Venice , where he is . He says how can he fulfil in the real what he has enacted in the counterfeit , while he still loves me ? Yet how , on the other hand , can he leave it unfulfilled ? All this time I have not told her , and up to this minute she believes that he has indeed taken her for better , for worse , till death them do part . It is a harassing position for me , and all three . In the awful approach of death , one 's judgment loses its balance , and we do anything to meet the exigencies of the moment , with a single eye to the one who excites our sympathy , and from whom we seem on the brink of being separated for ever . Had he really married her at that time all would be settled now . But he took too much thought ; she might have died , and then he had his reason . If indeed it had turned out so , I should now be perhaps a sad woman ; but not a tempest-tossed one . . . The possibility of his claiming me after all is what lies at the root of my agitation . Everything hangs by a thread . Suppose I tell her the marriage was a mockery ; suppose she is indignant with me and with him for the deception -- and then ? Otherwise , suppose she is not indignant but forgives all ; he is bound to marry her ; and honour constrains me to urge him thereto , in spite of what he protests , and to smooth the way to this issue by my method of informing her . I have meant to tell her the last month -- ever since she has been strong enough to bear such tidings ; but I have been without the power -- the moral force . Surely I must write , and get him to come and assist me . March 14. -- She continually wonders why he does not come , the five months of his enforced absence having expired ; and still more she wonders why he does not write oftener . His last letter was cold , she says , and she fears he regrets his marriage , which he may only have celebrated with her for pity 's sake , thinking she was sure to die . It makes one 's heart bleed to hear her hovering thus so near the truth , and yet never discerning its actual shape . A minor trouble besets me , too , in the person of the young Scripture reader , whose conscience pricks him for the part he played . Surely I am punished , if ever woman were , for a too ingenious perversion of her better judgment ! April 2. -- She is practically well . The faint pink revives in her cheek , though it is not quite so full as heretofore . But she still wonders what she can have done to offend 'her dear husband , ' and I have been obliged to tell the smallest part of the truth -- an unimportant fragment of the whole , in fact , I said that I feared for the moment he might regret the precipitancy of the act , which her illness caused , his affairs not having been quite sufficiently advanced for marriage just then , though he will doubtless come to her as soon as he has a home ready . Meanwhile I have written to him , peremptorily , to come and relieve me in this awful dilemma . He will find no note of love in that . April 10. -- To my alarm the letter I lately addressed to him at Venice , where he is staying , as well as the last one she sent him , have received no reply . She thinks he is ill . I do not quite think that , but I wish we could hear from him . Perhaps the peremptoriness of my words had offended him ; it grieves me to think it possible . I offend him ! But too much of this . I must tell her the truth , or she may in her ignorance commit herself to some course or other that may be ruinously compromising . She said plaintively just now that if he could see her , and know how occupied with him and him alone is her every waking hour , she is sure he would forgive her the wicked presumption of becoming his wife . Very sweet all that , and touching . I could not conceal my tears . April 15. -- The house is in confusion ; my father is angry and distressed , and I am distracted . Caroline has disappeared -- gone away secretly . I can not help thinking that I know where she is gone to . How guilty I seem , and how innocent she ! O that I had told her before now ! 1 o'clock. -- No trace of her as yet . We find also that the little waiting- maid we have here in training has disappeared with Caroline , and there is not much doubt that Caroline , fearing to travel alone , has induced this girl to go with her as companion . I am almost sure she has started in desperation to find him , and that Venice is her goal . Why should she run away , if not to join her husband , as she thinks him ? Now that I consider , there have been indications of this wish in her for days , as in birds of passage there lurk signs of their incipient intention ; and yet I did not think she would have taken such an extreme step , unaided , and without consulting me . I can only jot down the bare facts -- I have no time for reflections . But fancy Caroline travelling across the continent of Europe with a chit of a girl , who will be more of a charge than an assistance ! They will be a mark for every marauder who encounters them . Evening : 8 o'clock. -- Yes , it is as I surmised . She has gone to join him . A note posted by her in Budmouth Regis at daybreak has reached me this afternoon -- thanks to the fortunate chance of one of the servants calling for letters in town to-day , or I should not have got it until to-morrow . She merely asserts her determination of going to him , and has started privately , that nothing may hinder her ; stating nothing about her route . That such a gentle thing should suddenly become so calmly resolute quite surprises me . Alas , he may have left Venice -- she may not find him for weeks -- may not at all . My father , on learning the facts , bade me at once have everything ready by nine this evening , in time to drive to the train that meets the night steam-boat . This I have done , and there being an hour to spare before we start , I relieve the suspense of waiting by taking up my pen . He says overtake her we must , and calls Charles the hardest of names . He believes , of course , that she is merely an infatuated girl rushing off to meet her lover ; and how can the wretched I tell him that she is more , and in a sense better than that -- yet not sufficiently more and better to make this flight to Charles anything but a still greater danger to her than a mere lover 's impulse . We shall go by way of Paris , and we think we may overtake her there . I hear my father walking restlessly up and down the hall , and can write no more . CHAPTER VIII. -- SHE TRAVELS IN PURSUIT April 16 . Evening , Paris , Hotel -- -. -- There is no overtaking her at this place ; but she has been here , as I thought , no other hotel in Paris being known to her . We go on to-morrow morning . April 18 . Venice. -- A morning of adventures and emotions which leave me sick and weary , and yet unable to sleep , though I have lain down on the sofa of my room for more than an hour in the attempt . I therefore make up my diary to date in a hurried fashion , for the sake of the riddance it affords to ideas which otherwise remain suspended hotly in the brain . We arrived here this morning in broad sunlight , which lit up the sea-girt buildings as we approached so that they seemed like a city of cork floating raft-like on the smooth , blue deep . But I only glanced from the carriage window at the lovely scene , and we were soon across the intervening water and inside the railway station . When we got to the front steps the row of black gondolas and the shouts of the gondoliers so bewildered my father that he was understood to require two gondolas instead of one with two oars , and so I found him in one and myself in another . We got this righted after a while , and were rowed at once to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni where M. de la Feste had been staying when we last heard from him , the way being down the Grand Canal for some distance , under the Rialto , and then by narrow canals which eventually brought us under the Bridge of Sighs -- harmonious to our moods ! -- and out again into open water . The scene was purity itself as to colour , but it was cruel that I should behold it for the first time under such circumstances . As soon as I entered the hotel , which is an old-fashioned place , like most places here , where people are taken en pension as well as the ordinary way , I rushed to the framed list of visitors hanging in the hall , and in a moment I saw Charles 's name upon it among the rest . But she was our chief thought . I turned to the hall porter , and -- knowing that she would have travelled as 'Madame de la Feste ' -- I asked for her under that name , without my father hearing . ( He , poor soul , was making confused inquiries outside the door about 'an English lady , ' as if there were not a score of English ladies at hand . ) 'She has just come , ' said the porter . 'Madame came by the very early train this morning , when Monsieur was asleep , and she requested us not to disturb him . She is now in her room . ' Whether Caroline had seen us from the window , or overheard me , I do not know , but at that moment I heard footsteps on the bare marble stairs , and she appeared in person descending . 'Caroline ! ' I exclaimed , 'why have you done this ? ' and rushed up to her . She did not answer ; but looked down to hide her emotion , which she conquered after the lapse of a few seconds , putting on a practical tone that belied her . ' I am just going to my husband , ' she said . ' I have not yet seen him . I have not been here long . ' She condescended to give no further reason for her movements , and made as if to move on . I implored her to come into a private room where I could speak to her in confidence , but she objected . However , the dining-room , close at hand , was quite empty at this hour , and I got her inside and closed the door . I do not know how I began my explanation , or how I ended it , but I told her briefly and brokenly enough that the marriage was not real . 'Not real ? ' she said vacantly . 'It is not , ' said I . 'You will find that it is all as I say . ' She could not believe my meaning even then . 'Not his wife ? ' she cried . 'It is impossible . What am I , then ? ' I added more details , and reiterated the reason for my conduct as well as I could ; but Heaven knows how very difficult I found it to feel a jot more justification for it in my own mind than she did in hers . The revulsion of feeling , as soon as she really comprehended all , was most distressing . After her grief had in some measure spent itself she turned against both him and me . 'Why should have I been deceived like this ? ' she demanded , with a bitter haughtiness of which I had not deemed such a tractable creature capable . 'Do you suppose that anything could justify such an imposition ? What , O what a snare you have spread for me ! ' I murmured , 'Your life seemed to require it , ' but she did not hear me . She sank down in a chair , covered her face , and then my father came in . ' O , here you are ! ' he said . ' I could not find you . And Caroline ! ' 'And were you , papa , a party to this strange deed of kindness ? ' 'To what ? ' said he . Then out it all came , and for the first time he was made acquainted with the fact that the scheme for soothing her illness , which I had sounded him upon , had been really carried out . In a moment he sided with Caroline . My repeated assurance that my motive was good availed less than nothing . In a minute or two Caroline arose and went abruptly out of the room , and my father followed her , leaving me alone to my reflections . I was so bent upon finding Charles immediately that I did not notice whither they went . The servants told me that M. de la Feste was just outside smoking , and one of them went to look for him , I following ; but before we had gone many steps he came out of the hotel behind me . I expected him to be amazed ; but he showed no surprise at seeing me , though he showed another kind of feeling to an extent which dismayed me . I may have revealed something similar ; but I struggled hard against all emotion , and as soon as I could I told him she had come . He simply said 'Yes ' in a low voice . 'You know it , Charles ? ' said I . ' I have just learnt it , ' he said . ' O , Charles , ' I went on , 'having delayed completing your marriage with her till now , I fear -- it has become a serious position for us . Why did you not reply to our letters ? ' ' I was purposing to reply in person : I did not know how to address her on the point -- how to address you . But what has become of her ? ' 'She has gone off with my father , ' said I ; 'indignant with you , and scorning me . ' He was silent : and I suggested that we should follow them , pointing out the direction which I fancied their gondola had taken . As the one we got into was doubly manned we soon came in view of their two figures ahead of us , while they were not likely to observe us , our boat having the 'felze' on , while theirs was uncovered . They shot into a narrow canal just beyond the Giardino Reale , and by the time we were floating up between its slimy walls we saw them getting out of their gondola at the steps which lead up near the end of the Via 22 Marzo . When we reached the same spot they were walking up and down the Via in consultation . Getting out he stood on the lower steps watching them . I watched him . He seemed to fall into a reverie . 'Will you not go and speak to her ? ' said I at length . He assented , and went forward . Still he did not hasten to join them , but , screened by a projecting window , observed their musing converse . At last he looked back at me ; whereupon I pointed forward , and he in obedience stepped out , and met them face to face . Caroline flushed hot , bowed haughtily to him , turned away , and taking my father 's arm violently , led him off before he had had time to use his own judgment . They disappeared into a narrow calle , or alley , leading to the back of the buildings on the Grand Canal . M. de la Feste came slowly back ; as he stepped in beside me I realized my position so vividly that my heart might almost have been heard to beat . The third condition had arisen -- the least expected by either of us . She had refused him ; he was free to claim me . We returned in the boat together . He seemed quite absorbed till we had turned the angle into the Grand Canal , when he broke the silence . 'She spoke very bitterly to you in the salle-a-manger , ' he said . ' I do not think she was quite warranted in speaking so to you , who had nursed her so tenderly . ' ' O , but I think she was , ' I answered . 'It was there I told her what had been done ; she did not know till then . ' 'She was very dignified -- very striking , ' he murmured . 'You were more . ' 'But how do you know what passed between us , ' said I . He then told me that he had seen and heard all . The dining-room was divided by folding- doors from an inner portion , and he had been sitting in the latter part when we entered the outer , so that our words were distinctly audible . 'But , dear Alicia , ' he went on , ' I was more impressed by the affection of your apology to her than by anything else . And do you know that now the conditions have arisen which give me liberty to consider you my affianced ? ' I had been expecting this , but yet was not prepared . I stammered out that we would not discuss it then . 'Why not ? ' said he . 'Do you know that we may marry here and now ? She has cast off both you and me . ' 'It can not be , ' said I , firmly . 'She has not been fairly asked to be your wife in fact -- to repeat the service lawfully ; and until that has been done it would be grievous sin in me to accept you . ' I had not noticed where the gondoliers were rowing us . I suppose he had given them some direction unheard by me , for as I resigned myself in despairing indolence to the motion of the gondola , I perceived that it was taking us up the Canal , and , turning into a side opening near the Palazzo Grimani , drew up at some steps near the end of a large church . 'Where are we ? ' said I . 'It is the Church of the Frari , ' he replied . 'We might be married there . At any rate , let us go inside , and grow calm , and decide what to do . ' When we had entered I found that whether a place to marry in or not , it was one to depress . The word which Venice speaks most constantly -- decay -- was in a sense accentuated here . The whole large fabric itself seemed sinking into an earth which was not solid enough to bear it . Cobwebbed cracks zigzagged the walls , and similar webs clouded the window-panes . A sickly-sweet smell pervaded the aisles . After walking about with him a little while in embarrassing silences , divided only by his cursory explanations of the monuments and other objects , and almost fearing he might produce a marriage licence , I went to a door in the south transept which opened into the sacristy . I glanced through it , towards the small altar at the upper end . The place was empty save of one figure ; and she was kneeling here in front of the beautiful altarpiece by Bellini . Beautiful though it was she seemed not to see it . She was weeping and praying as though her heart was broken . She was my sister Caroline . I beckoned to Charles , and he came to my side , and looked through the door with me . 'Speak to her , ' said I . 'She will forgive you . ' I gently pushed him through the doorway , and went back into the transept , down the nave , and onward to the west door . There I saw my father , to whom I spoke . He answered severely that , having first obtained comfortable quarters in a pension on the Grand Canal , he had gone back to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni to find me ; but that I was not there . He was now waiting for Caroline , to accompany her back to the pension , at which she had requested to be left to herself as much as possible till she could regain some composure . I told him that it was useless to dwell on what was past , that I no doubt had erred , that the remedy lay in the future and their marriage . In this he quite agreed with me , and on my informing him that M. de la Feste was at that moment with Caroline in the sacristy , he assented to my proposal that we should leave them to themselves , and return together to await them at the pension , where he had also engaged a room for me . This we did , and going up to the chamber he had chosen for me , which overlooked the Canal , I leant from the window to watch for the gondola that should contain Charles and my sister . They were not long in coming . I recognized them by the colour of her sunshade as soon as they turned the bend on my right hand . They were side by side of necessity , but there was no conversation between them , and I thought that she looked flushed and he pale . When they were rowed in to the steps of our house he handed her up . I fancied she might have refused his assistance , but she did not . Soon I heard her pass my door , and wishing to know the result of their interview I went downstairs , seeing that the gondola had not put off with him . He was turning from the door , but not towards the water , intending apparently to walk home by way of the calle which led into the Via 22 Marzo . 'Has she forgiven you ? ' said I . ' I have not asked her , ' he said . 'But you are bound to do so , ' I told him . He paused , and then said , 'Alicia , let us understand each other . Do you mean to tell me , once for all , that if your sister is willing to become my wife you absolutely make way for her , and will not entertain any thought of what I suggested to you any more ? ' ' I do tell you so , ' said I with dry lips . 'You belong to her -- how can I do otherwise ? ' 'Yes ; it is so ; it is purely a question of honour , ' he returned . 'Very well then , honour shall be my word , and not my love . I will put the question to her frankly ; if she says yes , the marriage shall be . But not here . It shall be at your own house in England . ' 'When ? ' said I . ' I will accompany her there , ' he replied , 'and it shall be within a week of her return . I have nothing to gain by delay . But I will not answer for the consequences . ' 'What do you mean ? ' said I . He made no reply , went away , and I came back to my room . CHAPTER IX. -- SHE WITNESSES THE END April 20 . Milan , 10.30 p.m. -- We are thus far on our way homeward . I , being decidedly de trop , travel apart from the rest as much as I can . Having dined at the hotel here , I went out by myself ; regardless of the proprieties , for I could not stay in . I walked at a leisurely pace along the Via Allesandro Manzoni till my eye was caught by the grand Galleria Vittorio Emanuele , and I entered under the high glass arcades till I reached the central octagon , where I sat down on one of a group of chairs placed there . Becoming accustomed to the stream of promenaders , I soon observed , seated on the chairs opposite , Caroline and Charles . This was the first occasion on which I had seen them en tete-a-tete since my conversation with him . She soon caught sight of me ; averted her eyes ; then , apparently abandoning herself to an impulse , she jumped up from her seat and came across to me . We had not spoken to each other since the meeting in Venice . 'Alicia , ' she said , sitting down by my side , 'Charles asks me to forgive you , and I do forgive you . ' I pressed her hand , with tears in my eyes , and said , 'And do you forgive him ? ' 'Yes , ' said she , shyly . 'And what 's the result ? ' said I . 'We are to be married directly we reach home . ' This was almost the whole of our conversation ; she walked home with me , Charles following a little way behind , though she kept turning her head , as if anxious that he should overtake us . 'Honour and not love ' seemed to ring in my ears . So matters stand . Caroline is again happy . April 25. -- We have reached home , Charles with us . Events are now moving in silent speed , almost with velocity , indeed ; and I sometimes feel oppressed by the strange and preternatural ease which seems to accompany their flow . Charles is staying at the neighbouring town ; he is only waiting for the marriage licence ; when obtained he is to come here , be quietly married to her , and carry her off . It is rather resignation than content which sits on his face ; but he has not spoken a word more to me on the burning subject , or deviated one hair 's breadth from the course he laid down . They may be happy in time to come : I hope so . But I can not shake off depression . May 6. -- Eve of the wedding . Caroline is serenely happy , though not blithe . But there is nothing to excite anxiety about her . I wish I could say the same of him . He comes and goes like a ghost , and yet nobody seems to observe this strangeness in his mien . I could not help being here for the ceremony ; but my absence would have resulted in less disquiet on his part , I believe . However , I may be wrong in attributing causes : my father simply says that Charles and Caroline have as good a chance of being happy as other people . Well , to- morrow settles all . May 7. -- They are married : we have just returned from church . Charles looked so pale this morning that my father asked him if he was ill . He said , 'No : only a slight headache ; ' and we started for the church . There was no hitch or hindrance ; and the thing is done . 4 p.m. -- They ought to have set out on their journey by this time ; but there is an unaccountable delay . Charles went out half-an-hour ago , and has not yet returned . Caroline is waiting in the hall ; but I am dreadfully afraid they will miss the train . I suppose the trifling hindrance is of no account ; and yet I am full of misgivings . . . Sept . 14. -- Four months have passed ; only four months ! It seems like years . Can it be that only seventeen weeks ago I set on this paper the fact of their marriage ? I am now an aged woman by comparison ! On that never to be forgotten day we waited and waited , and Charles did not return . At six o'clock , when poor little Caroline had gone back to her room in a state of suspense impossible to describe , a man who worked in the water-meadows came to the house and asked for my father . He had an interview with him in the study . My father then rang his bell , and sent for me . I went down ; and I then learnt the fatal news . Charles was no more . The waterman had been going to shut down the hatches of a weir in the meads when he saw a hat on the edge of the pool below , floating round and round in the eddy , and looking into the pool saw something strange at the bottom . He knew what it meant , and lowering the hatches so that the water was still , could distinctly see the body . It is needless to write particulars that were in the newspapers at the time . Charles was brought to the house , but he was dead . We all feared for Caroline ; and she suffered much ; but strange to say , her suffering was purely of the nature of deep grief which found relief in sobbing and tears . It came out at the inquest that Charles had been accustomed to cross the meads to give an occasional half-crown to an old man who lived on the opposite hill , who had once been a landscape painter in an humble way till he lost his eyesight ; and it was assumed that he had gone thither for the same purpose to-day , and to bid him farewell . On this information the coroner 's jury found that his death had been caused by misadventure ; and everybody believes to this hour that he was drowned while crossing the weir to relieve the old man . Except one : she believes in no accident . After the stunning effect of the first news , I thought it strange that he should have chosen to go on such an errand at the last moment , and to go personally , when there was so little time to spare , since any gift could have been so easily sent by another hand . Further reflection has convinced me that this step out of life was as much a part of the day 's plan as was the wedding in the church hard by . They were the two halves of his complete intention when he gave me on the Grand Canal that assurance which I shall never forget : 'Very well , then ; honour shall be my word , not love . If she says `` Yes , '' the marriage shall be . ' I do not know why I should have made this entry at this particular time ; but it has occurred to me to do it -- to complete , in a measure , that part of my desultory chronicle which relates to the love-story of my sister and Charles . She lives on meekly in her grief ; and will probably outlive it ; while I -- but never mind me . CHAPTER X. -- SHE ADDS A NOTE LONG AFTER Five-years later. -- I have lighted upon this old diary , which it has interested me to look over , containing , as it does , records of the time when life shone more warmly in my eye than it does now . I am impelled to add one sentence to round off its record of the past . About a year ago my sister Caroline , after a persistent wooing , accepted the hand and heart of Theophilus Higham , once the blushing young Scripture reader who assisted at the substitute for a marriage I planned , and now the fully- ordained curate of the next parish . His penitence for the part he played ended in love . We have all now made atonement for our sins against her : may she be deceived no more . 1887 . THE GRAVE BY THE HANDPOST I never pass through Chalk-Newton without turning to regard the neighbouring upland , at a point where a lane crosses the lone straight highway dividing this from the next parish ; a sight which does not fail to recall the event that once happened there ; and , though it may seem superfluous , at this date , to disinter more memories of village history , the whispers of that spot may claim to be preserved . It was on a dark , yet mild and exceptionally dry evening at Christmas- time ( according to the testimony of William Dewy of Mellstock , Michael Mail , and others ) , that the choir of Chalk-Newton -- a large parish situate about half-way between the towns of Ivel and Casterbridge , and now a railway station -- left their homes just before midnight to repeat their annual harmonies under the windows of the local population . The band of instrumentalists and singers was one of the largest in the county ; and , unlike the smaller and finer Mellstock string-band , which eschewed all but the catgut , it included brass and reed performers at full Sunday services , and reached all across the west gallery . On this night there were two or three violins , two 'cellos , a tenor viol , double bass , hautboy , clarionets , serpent , and seven singers . It was , however , not the choir 's labours , but what its members chanced to witness , that particularly marked the occasion . They had pursued their rounds for many years without meeting with any incident of an unusual kind , but to-night , according to the assertions of several , there prevailed , to begin with , an exceptionally solemn and thoughtful mood among two or three of the oldest in the band , as if they were thinking they might be joined by the phantoms of dead friends who had been of their number in earlier years , and now were mute in the churchyard under flattening mounds -- friends who had shown greater zest for melody in their time than was shown in this ; or that some past voice of a semi-transparent figure might quaver from some bedroom-window its acknowledgment of their nocturnal greeting , instead of a familiar living neighbour . Whether this were fact or fancy , the younger members of the choir met together with their customary thoughtlessness and buoyancy . When they had gathered by the stone stump of the cross in the middle of the village , near the White Horse Inn , which they made their starting point , some one observed that they were full early , that it was not yet twelve o'clock . The local waits of those days mostly refrained from sounding a note before Christmas morning had astronomically arrived , and not caring to return to their beer , they decided to begin with some outlying cottages in Sidlinch Lane , where the people had no clocks , and would not know whether it were night or morning . In that direction they accordingly went ; and as they ascended to higher ground their attention was attracted by a light beyond the houses , quite at the top of the lane . The road from Chalk-Newton to Broad Sidlinch is about two miles long and in the middle of its course , where it passes over the ridge dividing the two villages , it crosses at right angles , as has been stated , the lonely monotonous old highway known as Long Ash Lane , which runs , straight as a surveyor 's line , many miles north and south of this spot , on the foundation of a Roman road , and has often been mentioned in these narratives . Though now quite deserted and grass-grown , at the beginning of the century it was well kept and frequented by traffic . The glimmering light appeared to come from the precise point where the roads intersected . ' I think I know what that mid mean ! ' one of the group remarked . They stood a few moments , discussing the probability of the light having origin in an event of which rumours had reached them , and resolved to go up the hill . Approaching the high land their conjectures were strengthened . Long Ash Lane cut athwart them , right and left ; and they saw that at the junction of the four ways , under the hand-post , a grave was dug , into which , as the choir drew nigh , a corpse had just been thrown by the four Sidlinch men employed for the purpose . The cart and horse which had brought the body thither stood silently by . The singers and musicians from Chalk-Newton halted , and looked on while the gravediggers shovelled in and trod down the earth , till , the hole being filled , the latter threw their spades into the cart , and prepared to depart . 'Who mid ye be a-burying there ? ' asked Lot Swanhills in a raised voice . 'Not the sergeant ? ' The Sidlinch men had been so deeply engrossed in their task that they had not noticed the lanterns of the Chalk-Newton choir till now . 'What -- be you the Newton carol-singers ? ' returned the representatives of Sidlinch . 'Ay , sure . Can it be that it is old Sergeant Holway you 've a-buried there ? ' ''Tis so . You 've heard about it , then ? ' The choir knew no particulars -- only that he had shot himself in his apple- closet on the previous Sunday . 'Nobody seem'th to know what ' a did it for , ' a b'lieve ? Leastwise , we do n't know at Chalk-Newton , ' continued Lot . ' O yes . It all came out at the inquest . ' The singers drew close , and the Sidlinch men , pausing to rest after their labours , told the story . 'It was all owing to that son of his , poor old man . It broke his heart . ' 'But the son is a soldier , surely ; now with his regiment in the East Indies ? ' 'Ay . And it have been rough with the army over there lately . 'T was a pity his father persuaded him to go . But Luke should n't have twyted the sergeant o't , since ' a did it for the best . ' The circumstances , in brief , were these : The sergeant who had come to this lamentable end , father of the young soldier who had gone with his regiment to the East , had been singularly comfortable in his military experiences , these having ended long before the outbreak of the great war with France . On his discharge , after duly serving his time , he had returned to his native village , and married , and taken kindly to domestic life . But the war in which England next involved herself had cost him many frettings that age and infirmity prevented him from being ever again an active unit of the army . When his only son grew to young manhood , and the question arose of his going out in life , the lad expressed his wish to be a mechanic . But his father advised enthusiastically for the army . 'Trade is coming to nothing in these days , ' he said . 'And if the war with the French lasts , as it will , trade will be still worse . The army , Luke -- that 's the thing for 'ee . 'T was the making of me , and 'twill be the making of you . I had n't half such a chance as you 'll have in these splendid hotter times . ' Luke demurred , for he was a home-keeping , peace-loving youth . But , putting respectful trust in his father 's judgment , he at length gave way , and enlisted in the -- -d Foot . In the course of a few weeks he was sent out to India to his regiment , which had distinguished itself in the East under General Wellesley . But Luke was unlucky . News came home indirectly that he lay sick out there ; and then on one recent day when his father was out walking , the old man had received tidings that a letter awaited him at Casterbridge . The sergeant sent a special messenger the whole nine miles , and the letter was paid for and brought home ; but though , as he had guessed , it came from Luke , its contents were of an unexpected tenor . The letter had been written during a time of deep depression . Luke said that his life was a burden and a slavery , and bitterly reproached his father for advising him to embark on a career for which he felt unsuited . He found himself suffering fatigues and illnesses without gaining glory , and engaged in a cause which he did not understand or appreciate . If it had not been for his father 's bad advice he , Luke , would now have been working comfortably at a trade in the village that he had never wished to leave . After reading the letter the sergeant advanced a few steps till he was quite out of sight of everybody , and then sat down on the bank by the wayside . When he arose half-an-hour later he looked withered and broken , and from that day his natural spirits left him . Wounded to the quick by his son's sarcastic stings , he indulged in liquor more and more frequently . His wife had died some years before this date , and the sergeant lived alone in the house which had been hers . One morning in the December under notice the report of a gun had been heard on his premises , and on entering the neighbours found him in a dying state . He had shot himself with an old firelock that he used for scaring birds ; and from what he had said the day before , and the arrangements he had made for his decease , there was no doubt that his end had been deliberately planned , as a consequence of the despondency into which he had been thrown by his son's letter . The coroner 's jury returned a verdict of felo de se . 'Here 's his son 's letter , ' said one of the Sidlinch men . ''Twas found in his father 's pocket . You can see by the state o't how many times he read it over . Howsomever , the Lord 's will be done , since it must , whether or no . ' The grave was filled up and levelled , no mound being shaped over it . The Sidlinch men then bade the Chalk-Newton choir good-night , and departed with the cart in which they had brought the sergeant 's body to the hill . When their tread had died away from the ear , and the wind swept over the isolated grave with its customary siffle of indifference , Lot Swanhills turned and spoke to old Richard Toller , the hautboy player . ''Tis hard upon a man , and he a wold sojer , to serve en so , Richard . Not that the sergeant was ever in a battle bigger than would go into a half- acre paddock , that 's true . Still , his soul ought to hae as good a chance as another man 's , all the same , hey ? ' Richard replied that he was quite of the same opinion . 'What d 'ye say to lifting up a carrel over his grave , as 't is Christmas , and no hurry to begin down in parish , and 'twould n't take up ten minutes , and not a soul up here to say us nay , or know anything about it ? ' Lot nodded assent . 'The man ought to hae his chances , ' he repeated . 'Ye may as well spet upon his grave , for all the good we shall do en by what we lift up , now he 's got so far , ' said Notton , the clarionet man and professed sceptic of the choir . 'But I 'm agreed if the rest be . ' They thereupon placed themselves in a semicircle by the newly stirred earth , and roused the dull air with the well-known Number Sixteen of their collection , which Lot gave out as being the one he thought best suited to the occasion and the mood He comes ' the pri'-soners to ' re-lease ' , In Sa'-tan 's bon'-dage held ' . 'Jown it -- we 've never played to a dead man afore , ' said Ezra Cattstock , when , having concluded the last verse , they stood reflecting for a breath or two . 'But it do seem more merciful than to go away and leave en , as they t'other fellers have done . ' 'Now backalong to Newton , and by the time we get overright the pa'son's 'twill be half after twelve , ' said the leader . They had not , however , done more than gather up their instruments when the wind brought to their notice the noise of a vehicle rapidly driven up the same lane from Sidlinch which the gravediggers had lately retraced . To avoid being run over when moving on , they waited till the benighted traveller , whoever he might be , should pass them where they stood in the wider area of the Cross . In half a minute the light of the lanterns fell upon a hired fly , drawn by a steaming and jaded horse . It reached the hand-post , when a voice from the inside cried , 'Stop here ! ' The driver pulled rein . The carriage door was opened from within , and there leapt out a private soldier in the uniform of some line regiment . He looked around , and was apparently surprised to see the musicians standing there . 'Have you buried a man here ? ' he asked . 'No . We bai n't Sidlinch folk , thank God ; we be Newton choir . Though a man is just buried here , that 's true ; and we 've raised a carrel over the poor mortal 's natomy . What -- do my eyes see before me young Luke Holway , that went wi ' his regiment to the East Indies , or do I see his spirit straight from the battlefield ? Be you the son that wrote the letter -- ' 'Do n't -- do n't ask me . The funeral is over , then ? ' 'There wer no funeral , in a Christen manner of speaking . But 's buried , sure enough . You must have met the men going back in the empty cart . ' 'Like a dog in a ditch , and all through me ! ' He remained silent , looking at the grave , and they could not help pitying him . 'My friends , ' he said , ' I understand better now . You have , I suppose , in neighbourly charity , sung peace to his soul ? I thank you , from my heart , for your kind pity . Yes ; I am Sergeant Holway 's miserable son -- I 'm the son who has brought about his father 's death , as truly as if I had done it with my own hand ! ' 'No , no . Do n't ye take on so , young man . He 'd been naturally low for a good while , off and on , so we hear . ' 'We were out in the East when I wrote to him . Everything had seemed to go wrong with me . Just after my letter had gone we were ordered home . That 's how it is you see me here . As soon as we got into barracks at Casterbridge I heard o ' this . . . Damn me ! I 'll dare to follow my father , and make away with myself , too . It is the only thing left to do ! ' 'Do n't ye be rash , Luke Holway , I say again ; but try to make amends by your future life . And maybe your father will smile a smile down from heaven upon 'ee for 't . ' He shook his head . ' I do n't know about that ! ' he answered bitterly . 'Try and be worthy of your father at his best . 'T is not too late . ' ' D 'ye think not ? I fancy it is ! . . . Well , I 'll turn it over . Thank you for your good counsel . I 'll live for one thing , at any rate . I'll move father 's body to a decent Christian churchyard , if I do it with my own hands . I ca n't save his life , but I can give him an honourable grave . He sha n't lie in this accursed place ! ' 'Ay , as our pa'son says , 't is a barbarous custom they keep up at Sidlinch , and ought to be done away wi ' . The man a ' old soldier , too . You see , our pa'son is not like yours at Sidlinch . ' 'He says it is barbarous , does he ? So it is ! ' cried the soldier . 'Now hearken , my friends . ' Then he proceeded to inquire if they would increase his indebtedness to them by undertaking the removal , privately , of the body of the suicide to the churchyard , not of Sidlinch , a parish he now hated , but of Chalk-Newton . He would give them all he possessed to do it . Lot asked Ezra Cattstock what he thought of it . Cattstock , the 'cello player , who was also the sexton , demurred , and advised the young soldier to sound the rector about it first . 'Mid be he would object , and yet ' a mid'nt . The pa'son o ' Sidlinch is a hard man , I own ye , and ' a said if folk will kill theirselves in hot blood they must take the consequences . But ours do n't think like that at all , and might allow it . ' 'What 's his name ? ' 'The honourable and reverent Mr. Oldham , brother to Lord Wessex . But you need n't be afeard o ' en on that account . He 'll talk to 'ee like a common man , if so be you have n't had enough drink to gie 'ee bad breath . ' ' O , the same as formerly . I 'll ask him . Thank you . And that duty done -- ' 'What then ? ' 'There 's war in Spain . I hear our next move is there . I 'll try to show myself to be what my father wished me . I do n't suppose I shall -- but I'll try in my feeble way . That much I swear -- here over his body . So help me God . ' Luke smacked his palm against the white hand-post with such force that it shook . 'Yes , there 's war in Spain ; and another chance for me to be worthy of father . ' So the matter ended that night . That the private acted in one thing as he had vowed to do soon became apparent , for during the Christmas week the rector came into the churchyard when Cattstock was there , and asked him to find a spot that would be suitable for the purpose of such an interment , adding that he had slightly known the late sergeant , and was not aware of any law which forbade him to assent to the removal , the letter of the rule having been observed . But as he did not wish to seem moved by opposition to his neighbour at Sidlinch , he had stipulated that the act of charity should be carried out at night , and as privately as possible , and that the grave should be in an obscure part of the enclosure . 'You had better see the young man about it at once , ' added the rector . But before Ezra had done anything Luke came down to his house . His furlough had been cut short , owing to new developments of the war in the Peninsula , and being obliged to go back to his regiment immediately , he was compelled to leave the exhumation and reinterment to his friends . Everything was paid for , and he implored them all to see it carried out forthwith . With this the soldier left . The next day Ezra , on thinking the matter over , again went across to the rectory , struck with sudden misgiving . He had remembered that the sergeant had been buried without a coffin , and he was not sure that a stake had not been driven through him . The business would be more troublesome than they had at first supposed . 'Yes , indeed ! ' murmured the rector . ' I am afraid it is not feasible after all . ' The next event was the arrival of a headstone by carrier from the nearest town ; to be left at Mr. Ezra Cattstock 's ; all expenses paid . The sexton and the carrier deposited the stone in the former 's outhouse ; and Ezra , left alone , put on his spectacles and read the brief and simple inscription : - HERE LYETH THE BODY OF SAMUEL HOLWAY , LATE SERGEANT IN HIS MAJESTY'S -- -D REGIMENT OF FOOT , WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE DECEMBER THE 20TH , 180- . ERECTED BY L. H. ' I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON . ' Ezra again called at the riverside rectory . 'The stone is come , sir . But I 'm afeard we ca n't do it nohow . ' ' I should like to oblige him , ' said the gentlemanly old incumbent . 'And I would forego all fees willingly . Still , if you and the others don't think you can carry it out , I am in doubt what to say . ' Well , sir ; I 've made inquiry of a Sidlinch woman as to his burial , and what I thought seems true . They buried en wi ' a new six-foot hurdle-saul drough 's body , from the sheep-pen up in North Ewelease though they won't own to it now . And the question is , Is the moving worth while , considering the awkwardness ? ' 'Have you heard anything more of the young man ? ' Ezra had only heard that he had embarked that week for Spain with the rest of the regiment . 'And if he 's as desperate as ' a seemed , we shall never see him here in England again . ' 'It is an awkward case , ' said the rector . Ezra talked it over with the choir ; one of whom suggested that the stone might be erected at the crossroads . This was regarded as impracticable . Another said that it might be set up in the churchyard without removing the body ; but this was seen to be dishonest . So nothing was done . The headstone remained in Ezra 's outhouse till , growing tired of seeing it there , he put it away among the bushes at the bottom of his garden . The subject was sometimes revived among them , but it always ended with : 'Considering how ' a was buried , we can hardly make a job o't . ' There was always the consciousness that Luke would never come back , an impression strengthened by the disasters which were rumoured to have befallen the army in Spain . This tended to make their inertness permanent . The headstone grew green as it lay on its back under Ezra's bushes ; then a tree by the river was blown down , and , falling across the stone , cracked it in three pieces . Ultimately the pieces became buried in the leaves and mould . Luke had not been born a Chalk-Newton man , and he had no relations left in Sidlinch , so that no tidings of him reached either village throughout the war . But after Waterloo and the fall of Napoleon there arrived at Sidlinch one day an English sergeant-major covered with stripes and , as it turned out , rich in glory . Foreign service had so totally changed Luke Holway that it was not until he told his name that the inhabitants recognized him as the sergeant 's only son . He had served with unswerving effectiveness through the Peninsular campaigns under Wellington ; had fought at Busaco , Fuentes d'Onore , Ciudad Rodrigo , Badajoz , Salamanca , Vittoria , Quatre Bras , and Waterloo ; and had now returned to enjoy a more than earned pension and repose in his native district . He hardly stayed in Sidlinch longer than to take a meal on his arrival . The same evening he started on foot over the hill to Chalk-Newton , passing the hand-post , and saying as he glanced at the spot , 'Thank God : he 's not there ! ' Nightfall was approaching when he reached the latter village ; but he made straight for the churchyard . On his entering it there remained light enough to discern the headstones by , and these he narrowly scanned . But though he searched the front part by the road , and the back part by the river , what he sought he could not find -- the grave of Sergeant Holway , and a memorial bearing the inscription : ' I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON . ' He left the churchyard and made inquiries . The honourable and reverend old rector was dead , and so were many of the choir ; but by degrees the sergeant-major learnt that his father still lay at the cross-roads in Long Ash Lane . Luke pursued his way moodily homewards , to do which , in the natural course , he would be compelled to repass the spot , there being no other road between the two villages . But he could not now go by that place , vociferous with reproaches in his father 's tones ; and he got over the hedge and wandered deviously through the ploughed fields to avoid the scene . Through many a fight and fatigue Luke had been sustained by the thought that he was restoring the family honour and making noble amends . Yet his father lay still in degradation . It was rather a sentiment than a fact that his father 's body had been made to suffer for his own misdeeds ; but to his super-sensitiveness it seemed that his efforts to retrieve his character and to propitiate the shade of the insulted one had ended in failure . He endeavoured , however , to shake off his lethargy , and , not liking the associations of Sidlinch , hired a small cottage at Chalk-Newton which had long been empty . Here he lived alone , becoming quite a hermit , and allowing no woman to enter the house . The Christmas after taking up his abode herein he was sitting in the chimney corner by himself , when he heard faint notes in the distance , and soon a melody burst forth immediately outside his own window , it came from the carol-singers , as usual ; and though many of the old hands , Ezra and Lot included , had gone to their rest , the same old carols were still played out of the same old books . There resounded through the sergeant- major 's window-shutters the familiar lines that the deceased choir had rendered over his father 's grave : - He comes ' the pri'-soners to ' re-lease ' , In Sa'-tan 's bon'-dage held ' . When they had finished they went on to another house , leaving him to silence and loneliness as before . The candle wanted snuffing , but he did not snuff it , and he sat on till it had burnt down into the socket and made waves of shadow on the ceiling . The Christmas cheerfulness of next morning was broken at breakfast-time by tragic intelligence which went down the village like wind . Sergeant- Major Holway had been found shot through the head by his own hand at the cross-roads in Long Ash Lane where his father lay buried . On the table in the cottage he had left a piece of paper , on which he had written his wish that he might be buried at the Cross beside his father . But the paper was accidentally swept to the floor , and overlooked till after his funeral , which took place in the ordinary way in the churchyard . Christmas 1897 . ENTER A DRAGOON I lately had a melancholy experience ( said the gentleman who is answerable for the truth of this story ) . It was that of going over a doomed house with whose outside aspect I had long been familiar -- a house , that is , which by reason of age and dilapidation was to be pulled down during the following week . Some of the thatch , brown and rotten as the gills of old mushrooms , had , indeed , been removed before I walked over the building . Seeing that it was only a very small house -- which is usually called a 'cottage-residence ' -- situated in a remote hamlet , and that it was not more than a hundred years old , if so much , I was led to think in my progress through the hollow rooms , with their cracked walls and sloping floors , what an exceptional number of abrupt family incidents had taken place therein -- to reckon only those which had come to my own knowledge . And no doubt there were many more of which I had never heard . It stood at the top of a garden stretching down to the lane or street that ran through a hermit-group of dwellings in Mellstock parish . From a green gate at the lower entrance , over which the thorn hedge had been shaped to an arch by constant clippings , a gravel path ascended between the box edges of once trim raspberry , strawberry , and vegetable plots , towards the front door . This was in colour an ancient and bleached green that could be rubbed off with the finger , and it bore a small long-featured brass knocker covered with verdigris in its crevices . For some years before this eve of demolition the homestead had degenerated , and been divided into two tenements to serve as cottages for farm labourers ; but in its prime it had indisputable claim to be considered neat , pretty , and genteel . The variety of incidents above alluded to was mainly owing to the nature of the tenure , whereby the place had been occupied by families not quite of the kind customary in such spots -- people whose circumstances , position , or antecedents were more or less of a critical happy-go-lucky cast . And of these residents the family whose term comprised the story I wish to relate was that of Mr. Jacob Paddock the market-gardener , who dwelt there for some years with his wife and grown-up daughter . I An evident commotion was agitating the premises , which jerked busy sounds across the front plot , resembling those of a disturbed hive . If a member of the household appeared at the door it was with a countenance of abstraction and concern . Evening began to bend over the scene ; and the other inhabitants of the hamlet came out to draw water , their common well being in the public road opposite the garden and house of the Paddocks . Having wound up their bucketsfull respectively they lingered , and spoke significantly together . From their words any casual listener might have gathered information of what had occurred . The woodman who lived nearest the site of the story told most of the tale . Selina , the daughter of the Paddocks opposite , had been surprised that afternoon by receiving a letter from her once intended husband , then a corporal , but now a sergeant-major of dragoons , whom she had hitherto supposed to be one of the slain in the Battle of the Alma two or three years before . 'She picked up wi'en against her father 's wish , as we know , and before he got his stripes , ' their informant continued . 'Not but that the man was as hearty a feller as you 'd meet this side o ' London . But Jacob , you see , wished her to do better , and one can understand it . However , she was determined to stick to him at that time ; and for what happened she was not much to blame , so near as they were to matrimony when the war broke out and spoiled all . ' 'Even the very pig had been killed for the wedding , ' said a woman , 'and the barrel o ' beer ordered in . O , the man meant honourable enough . But to be off in two days to fight in a foreign country -- 't was natural of her father to say they should wait till he got back . ' 'And he never came , ' murmured one in the shade . 'The war ended but her man never turned up again . She was not sure he was killed , but was too proud , or too timid , to go and hunt for him . ' 'One reason why her father forgave her when he found out how matters stood was , as he said plain at the time , that he liked the man , and could see that he meant to act straight . So the old folks made the best of what they could n't mend , and kept her there with 'em , when some would n't . Time has proved seemingly that he did mean to act straight , now that he has writ to her that he 's coming . She 'd have stuck to him all through the time , 't is my belief ; if t'other had n't come along . ' 'At the time of the courtship , ' resumed the woodman , 'the regiment was quartered in Casterbridge Barracks , and he and she got acquainted by his calling to buy a penn'orth of rathe-ripes off that tree yonder in her father 's orchard -- though 't was said he seed her over hedge as well as the apples . He declared 't was a kind of apple he much fancied ; and he called for a penn'orth every day till the tree was cleared . It ended in his calling for her . ' ''Twas a thousand pities they did n't jine up at once and ha ' done wi ' it . 'Well ; better late than never , if so be he 'll have her now . But , Lord , she 'd that faith in 'en that she 'd no more belief that he was alive , when a ' did n't come , than that the undermost man in our churchyard was alive . She 'd never have thought of another but for that -- O no ! ' ''Tis awkward , altogether , for her now . ' 'Still she had n't married wi ' the new man . Though to be sure she would have committed it next week , even the licence being got , they say , for she 'd have no banns this time , the first being so unfortunate . ' 'Perhaps the sergeant-major will think he 's released , and go as he came . ' ' O , not as I reckon . Soldiers bai n't particular , and she 's a tidy piece o ' furniture still . What will happen is that she 'll have her soldier , and break off with the master-wheelwright , licence or no -- daze me if she wo n't . ' In the progress of these desultory conjectures the form of another neighbour arose in the gloom . She nodded to the people at the well , who replied ' G 'd night , Mrs. Stone , ' as she passed through Mr. Paddock 's gate towards his door . She was an intimate friend of the latter 's household , and the group followed her with their eyes up the path and past the windows , which were now lighted up by candles inside . II Mrs. Stone paused at the door , knocked , and was admitted by Selina's mother , who took her visitor at once into the parlour on the left hand , where a table was partly spread for supper . On the 'beaufet ' against the wall stood probably the only object which would have attracted the eye of a local stranger in an otherwise ordinarily furnished room , a great plum- cake guarded as if it were a curiosity by a glass shade of the kind seen in museums -- square , with a wooden back like those enclosing stuffed specimens of rare feather or fur . This was the mummy of the cake intended in earlier days for the wedding-feast of Selina and the soldier , which had been religiously and lovingly preserved by the former as a testimony to her intentional respectability in spite of an untoward subsequent circumstance , which will be mentioned . This relic was now as dry as a brick , and seemed to belong to a pre-existent civilization . Till quite recently , Selina had been in the habit of pausing before it daily , and recalling the accident whose consequences had thrown a shadow over her life ever since -- that of which the water-drawers had spoken -- the sudden news one morning that the Route had come for the -- -th Dragoons , two days only being the interval before departure ; the hurried consultation as to what should be done , the second time of asking being past but not the third ; and the decision that it would be unwise to solemnize matrimony in such haphazard circumstances , even if it were possible , which was doubtful . Before the fire the young woman in question was now seated on a low stool , in the stillness of reverie , and a toddling boy played about the floor around her . 'Ah , Mrs . Stone ! ' said Selina , rising slowly . 'How kind of you to come in . You 'll bide to supper ? Mother has told you the strange news , of course ? ' 'No . But I heard it outside , that is , that you 'd had a letter from Mr. Clark -- Sergeant-Major Clark , as they say he is now -- and that he 's coming to make it up with 'ee . ' 'Yes ; coming to-night -- all the way from the north of England where he's quartered . I do n't know whether I 'm happy or -- frightened at it . Of course I always believed that if he was alive he 'd come and keep his solemn vow to me . But when it is printed that a man is killed -- what can you think ? ' 'It was printed ? ' 'Why , yes . After the Battle of the Alma the book of the names of the killed and wounded was nailed up against Casterbridge Town Hall door . 'T was on a Saturday , and I walked there o ' purpose to read and see for myself ; for I 'd heard that his name was down . There was a crowd of people round the book , looking for the names of relations ; and I can mind that when they saw me they made way for me -- knowing that we 'd been just going to be married -- and that , as you may say , I belonged to him . Well , I reached up my arm , and turned over the farrels of the book , and under the `` killed '' I read his surname , but instead of `` John '' they 'd printed '' James , '' and I thought 't was a mistake , and that it must be he . Who could have guessed there were two nearly of one name in one regiment . ' 'Well -- he 's coming to finish the wedding of 'ee as may be said ; so never mind , my dear . All 's well that ends well . ' 'That 's what he seems to say . But then he has not heard yet about Mr. Miller ; and that 's what rather terrifies me . Luckily my marriage with him next week was to have been by licence , and not banns , as in John's case ; and it was not so well known on that account . Still , I do n't know what to think . ' 'Everything seems to come just 'twixt cup and lip with 'ee , do n't it now , Miss Paddock . Two weddings broke off -- 't is odd ! How came you to accept Mr. Miller , my dear ? ' 'He 's been so good and faithful ! Not minding about the child at all ; for he knew the rights of the story . He 's dearly fond o ' Johnny , you know -- just as if 'twere his own -- is n't he , my duck ? Do Mr. Miller love you or do n't he ? ' 'Iss ! An ' I love Mr. Miller , ' said the toddler . 'Well , you see , Mrs. Stone , he said he 'd make me a comfortable home ; and thinking 'twould be a good thing for Johnny , Mr. Miller being so much better off than me , I agreed at last , just as a widow might -- which is what I have always felt myself ; ever since I saw what I thought was John 's name printed there . I hope John will forgive me ! ' 'So he will forgive 'ee , since 't was no manner of wrong to him . He ought to have sent 'ee a line , saying 't was another man . ' Selina 's mother entered . 'We 've not known of this an hour , Mrs. Stone , ' she said . 'The letter was brought up from Lower Mellstock Post-office by one of the school children , only this afternoon . Mr. Miller was coming here this very night to settle about the wedding doings . Hark ! Is that your father ? Or is it Mr. Miller already come ? ' The footsteps entered the porch ; there was a brushing on the mat , and the door of the room sprung back to disclose a rubicund man about thirty years of age , of thriving master-mechanic appearance and obviously comfortable temper . On seeing the child , and before taking any notice whatever of the elders , the comer made a noise like the crowing of a cock and flapped his arms as if they were wings , a method of entry which had the unqualified admiration of Johnny . 'Yes -- it is he , ' said Selina constrainedly advancing . 'What -- were you all talking about me , my dear ? ' said the genial young man when he had finished his crowing and resumed human manners . 'Why what's the matter , ' he went on . 'You look struck all of a heap . ' Mr. Miller spread an aspect of concern over his own face , and drew a chair up to the fire . ' O mother , would you tell Mr. Miller , if he do n't know ? ' 'Mister Miller ! and going to be married in six days ! ' he interposed . 'Ah -- he do n't know it yet ! ' murmured Mrs. Paddock . 'Know what ? ' 'Well -- John Clark -- now Sergeant-Major Clark -- was n't shot at Alma after all . 'T was another of almost the same name . ' 'Now that 's interesting ! There were several cases like that . ' 'And he 's home again ; and he 's coming here to-night to see her . ' 'Whatever shall I say , that he may not be offended with what I 've done ? ' interposed Selina . 'But why should it matter if he be ? ' ' O ! I must agree to be his wife if he forgives me -- of course I must . ' 'Must ! But why not say nay , Selina , even if he do forgive 'ee ? ' ' O no ! How can I without being wicked ? You were very very kind , Mr. Miller , to ask me to have you ; no other man would have done it after what had happened ; and I agreed , even though I did not feel half so warm as I ought . Yet it was entirely owing to my believing him in the grave , as I knew that if he were not he would carry out his promise ; and this shows that I was right in trusting him . ' 'Yes . . . He must be a goodish sort of fellow , ' said Mr. Miller , for a moment so impressed with the excellently faithful conduct of the sergeant- major of dragoons that he disregarded its effect upon his own position . He sighed slowly and added , 'Well , Selina , 't is for you to say . I love you , and I love the boy ; and there 's my chimney-corner and sticks o' furniture ready for 'ee both . ' 'Yes , I know ! But I must n't hear it any more now , ' murmured Selina quickly . 'John will be here soon . I hope he 'll see how it all was when I tell him . If so be I could have written it to him it would have been better . ' 'You think he does n't know a single word about our having been on the brink o't . But perhaps it 's the other way -- he 's heard of it and that may have brought him . 'Ah -- perhaps he has ! ' she said brightening . 'And already forgives me . ' 'If not , speak out straight and fair , and tell him exactly how it fell out . If he 's a man he 'll see it . ' ' O he 's a man true enough . But I really do think I sha n't have to tell him at all , since you 've put it to me that way ! ' As it was now Johnny 's bedtime he was carried upstairs , and when Selina came down again her mother observed with some anxiety , ' I fancy Mr. Clark must be here soon if he 's coming ; and that being so , perhaps Mr. Miller would n't mind -- wishing us good-night ! since you are so determined to stick to your sergeant-major . ' A little bitterness bubbled amid the closing words . 'It would be less awkward , Mr. Miller not being here -- if he will allow me to say it . ' 'To be sure ; to be sure , ' the master-wheelwright exclaimed with instant conviction , rising alertly from his chair . 'Lord bless my soul , ' he said , taking up his hat and stick , 'and we to have been married in six days ! But Selina -- you 're right . You do belong to the child 's father since he 's alive . I 'll try to make the best of it . ' Before the generous Miller had got further there came a knock to the door accompanied by the noise of wheels . ' I thought I heard something driving up ! ' said Mrs Paddock . They heard Mr. Paddock , who had been smoking in the room opposite , rise and go to the door , and in a moment a voice familiar enough to Selina was audibly saying , 'At last I am here again -- not without many interruptions ! How is it with 'ee , Mr. Paddock ? And how is she ? Thought never to see me again , I suppose ? ' A step with a clink of spurs in it struck upon the entry floor . 'Danged if I bai n't catched ! ' murmured Mr. Miller , forgetting company- speech . 'Never mind -- I may as well meet him here as elsewhere ; and I should like to see the chap , and make friends with en , as he seems one o' the right sort . ' He returned to the fireplace just as the sergeant-major was ushered in . III He was a good specimen of the long-service soldier of those days ; a not unhandsome man , with a certain undemonstrative dignity , which some might have said to be partly owing to the stiffness of his uniform about his neck , the high stock being still worn . He was much stouter than when Selina had parted from him . Although she had not meant to be demonstrative she ran across to him directly she saw him , and he held her in his arms and kissed her . Then in much agitation she whispered something to him , at which he seemed to be much surprised . 'He 's just put to bed , ' she continued . 'You can go up and see him . I knew you 'd come if you were alive ! But I had quite gi 'd you up for dead . You 've been home in England ever since the war ended ? ' 'Yes , dear . ' 'Why did n't you come sooner ? ' 'That 's just what I ask myself ! Why was I such a sappy as not to hurry here the first day I set foot on shore ! Well , who 'd have thought it -- you are as pretty as ever ! ' He relinquished her to peep upstairs a little way , where , by looking through the ballusters , he could see Johnny 's cot just within an open door . On his stepping down again Mr. Miller was preparing to depart . 'Now , what 's this ? I am sorry to see anybody going the moment I've come , ' expostulated the sergeant-major . ' I thought we might make an evening of it . There 's a nine gallon cask o ' `` Phoenix '' beer outside in the trap , and a ham , and half a rawmil ' cheese ; for I thought you might be short o ' forage in a lonely place like this ; and it struck me we might like to ask in a neighbour or two . But perhaps it would be taking a liberty ? ' ' O no , not at all , ' said Mr. Paddock , who was now in the room , in a judicial measured manner . 'Very thoughtful of 'ee , only 't was not necessary , for we had just laid in an extry stock of eatables and drinkables in preparation for the coming event . ' ''Twas very kind , upon my heart , ' said the soldier , 'to think me worth such a jocund preparation , since you could only have got my letter this morning . ' Selina gazed at her father to stop him , and exchanged embarrassed glances with Miller . Contrary to her hopes Sergeant-Major Clark plainly did not know that the preparations referred to were for something quite other than his own visit . The movement of the horse outside , and the impatient tapping of a whip- handle upon the vehicle reminded them that Clark 's driver was still in waiting . The provisions were brought into the house , and the cart dismissed . Miller , with very little pressure indeed , accepted an invitation to supper , and a few neighbours were induced to come in to make up a cheerful party . During the laying of the meal , and throughout its continuance , Selina , who sat beside her first intended husband , tried frequently to break the news to him of her engagement to the other -- now terminated so suddenly , and so happily for her heart , and her sense of womanly virtue . But the talk ran entirely upon the late war ; and though fortified by half a horn of the strong ale brought by the sergeant-major she decided that she might have a better opportunity when supper was over of revealing the situation to him in private . Having supped , Clark leaned back at ease in his chair and looked around . 'We used sometimes to have a dance in that other room after supper , Selina dear , I recollect . We used to clear out all the furniture into this room before beginning . Have you kept up such goings on ? ' 'No , not at all ! ' said his sweetheart , sadly . 'We were not unlikely to revive it in a few days , ' said Mr. Paddock . 'But , howsomever , there 's seemingly many a slip , as the saying is . ' 'Yes , I 'll tell John all about that by and by ! ' interposed Selina ; at which , perceiving that the secret which he did not like keeping was to be kept even yet , her father held his tongue with some show of testiness . The subject of a dance having been broached , to put the thought in practice was the feeling of all . Soon after the tables and chairs were borne from the opposite room to this by zealous hands , and two of the villagers sent home for a fiddle and tambourine , when the majority began to tread a measure well known in that secluded vale . Selina naturally danced with the sergeant-major , not altogether to her father's satisfaction , and to the real uneasiness of her mother , both of whom would have preferred a postponement of festivities till the rashly anticipated relationship between their daughter and Clark in the past had been made fact by the church 's ordinances . They did not , however , express a positive objection , Mr. Paddock remembering , with self-reproach , that it was owing to his original strongly expressed disapproval of Selina 's being a soldier 's wife that the wedding had been delayed , and finally hindered -- with worse consequences than were expected ; and ever since the misadventure brought about by his government he had allowed events to steer their own courses . 'My tails will surely catch in your spurs , John ! ' murmured the daughter of the house , as she whirled around upon his arm with the rapt soul and look of a somnambulist . ' I did n't know we should dance , or I would have put on my other frock . ' ' I 'll take care , my love . We 've danced here before . Do you think your father objects to me now ? I 've risen in rank . I fancy he 's still a little against me . ' 'He has repented , times enough . ' 'And so have I ! If I had married you then 'twould have saved many a misfortune . I have sometimes thought it might have been possible to rush the ceremony through somehow before I left ; though we were only in the second asking , were we ? And even if I had come back straight here when we returned from the Crimea , and married you then , how much happier I should have been ! ' 'Dear John , to say that ! Why did n't you ? ' ' O -- dilatoriness and want of thought , and a fear of facing your father after so long . I was in hospital a great while , you know . But how familiar the place seems again ! What 's that I saw on the beaufet in the other room ? It never used to be there . A sort of withered corpse of a cake -- not an old bride-cake surely ? ' 'Yes , John , ours . 'T is the very one that was made for our wedding three years ago . ' 'Sakes alive ! Why , time shuts up together , and all between then and now seems not to have been ! What became of that wedding-gown that they were making in this room , I remember -- a bluish , whitish , frothy thing ? ' ' I have that too . ' 'Really ! . . . Why , Selina -- ' 'Yes ! ' 'Why not put it on now ? ' 'Would n't it seem -- . And yet , O how I should like to ! It would remind them all , if we told them what it was , how we really meant to be married on that bygone day ! ' Her eyes were again laden with wet . 'Yes . . . The pity that we did n't -- the pity ! ' Moody mournfulness seemed to hold silent awhile one not naturally taciturn . 'Well -- will you ? ' he said . ' I will -- the next dance , if mother do n't mind . ' Accordingly , just before the next figure was formed , Selina disappeared , and speedily came downstairs in a creased and box-worn , but still airy and pretty , muslin gown , which was indeed the very one that had been meant to grace her as a bride three years before . 'It is dreadfully old-fashioned , ' she apologized . 'Not at all . What a grand thought of mine ! Now , let 's to't again . ' She explained to some of them , as he led her to the second dance , what the frock had been meant for , and that she had put it on at his request . And again athwart and around the room they went . 'You seem the bride ! ' he said . 'But I could n't wear this gown to be married in now ! ' she replied , ecstatically , 'or I should n't have put it on and made it dusty . It is really too old-fashioned , and so folded and fretted out , you ca n't think . That was with my taking it out so many times to look at . I have never put it on -- never -- till now ! ' 'Selina , I am thinking of giving up the army . Will you emigrate with me to New Zealand ? I 've an uncle out there doing well , and he 'd soon help me to making a larger income . The English army is glorious , but it ain't altogether enriching . ' 'Of course , anywhere that you decide upon . Is it healthy there for Johnny ? ' ' A lovely climate . And I shall never be happy in England . . . Aha ! ' he concluded again , with a bitterness of unexpected strength , 'would to Heaven I had come straight back here ! ' As the dance brought round one neighbour after another the re-united pair were thrown into juxtaposition with Bob Heartall among the rest who had been called in ; one whose chronic expression was that he carried inside him a joke on the point of bursting with its own vastness . He took occasion now to let out a little of its quality , shaking his head at Selina as he addressed her in an undertone -- 'This is a bit of a topper to the bridegroom , ho ho ! 'Twill teach en the liberty you 'll expect when you 've married en ! ' 'What does he mean by a `` topper , '' ' the sergeant-major asked , who , not being of local extraction , despised the venerable local language , and also seemed to suppose 'bridegroom ' to be an anticipatory name for himself . ' I only hope I shall never be worse treated than you 've treated me to-night ! ' Selina looked frightened . 'He did n't mean you , dear , ' she said as they moved on . 'We thought perhaps you knew what had happened , owing to your coming just at this time . Had you -- heard anything about -- what I intended ? ' 'Not a breath -- how should I -- away up in Yorkshire ? It was by the merest accident that I came just at this date to make peace with you for my delay . ' ' I was engaged to be married to Mr. Bartholomew Miller . That 's what it is ! I would have let 'ee know by letter , but there was no time , only hearing from 'ee this afternoon . . . You wo n't desert me for it , will you , John ? Because , as you know , I quite supposed you dead , and -- and -- ' Her eyes were full of tears of trepidation , and he might have felt a sob heaving within her . IV The soldier was silent during two or three double bars of the tune . 'When were you to have been married to the said Mr. Bartholomew Miller ? ' he inquired . 'Quite soon . ' 'How soon ? ' 'Next week -- O yes -- just the same as it was with you and me . There 's a strange fate of interruption hanging over me , I sometimes think ! He had bought the licence , which I preferred so that it might n't be like -- ours . But it made no difference to the fate of it . ' 'Had bought the licence ! The devil ! ' 'Do n't be angry , dear John . I did n't know ! ' 'No , no , I 'm not angry . ' 'It was so kind of him , considering ! ' 'Yes . . . I see , of course , how natural your action was -- never thinking of seeing me any more ! Is it the Mr. Miller who is in this dance ? ' 'Yes . ' Clark glanced round upon Bartholomew and was silent again , for some little while , and she stole a look at him , to find that he seemed changed . 'John , you look ill ! ' she almost sobbed . ''Tis n't me , is it ? ' ' O dear , no . Though I had n't , somehow , expected it . I ca n't find fault with you for a moment -- and I do n't . . . This is a deuce of a long dance , do n't you think ? We 've been at it twenty minutes if a second , and the figure does n't allow one much rest . I 'm quite out of breath . ' 'They like them so dreadfully long here . Shall we drop out ? Or I'll stop the fiddler . ' ' O no , no , I think I can finish . But although I look healthy enough I have never been so strong as I formerly was , since that long illness I had in the hospital at Scutari . ' 'And I knew nothing about it ! ' 'You could n't , dear , as I did n't write . What a fool I have been altogether ! ' He gave a twitch , as of one in pain . ' I wo n't dance again when this one is over . The fact is I have travelled a long way to-day , and it seems to have knocked me up a bit . ' There could be no doubt that the sergeant-major was unwell , and Selina made herself miserable by still believing that her story was the cause of his ailment . Suddenly he said in a changed voice , and she perceived that he was paler than ever : ' I must sit down . ' Letting go her waist he went quickly to the other room . She followed , and found him in the nearest chair , his face bent down upon his hands and arms , which were resting on the table . 'What 's the matter ? ' said her father , who sat there dozing by the fire . 'John is n't well . . . We are going to New Zealand when we are married , father . A lovely country ! John , would you like something to drink ? ' ' A drop o ' that Schiedam of old Owlett 's , that 's under stairs , perhaps , ' suggested her father . 'Not that nowadays 't is much better than licensed liquor . ' 'John , ' she said , putting her face close to his and pressing his arm . 'Will you have a drop of spirits or something ? ' He did not reply , and Selina observed that his ear and the side of his face were quite white . Convinced that his illness was serious , a growing dismay seized hold of her . The dance ended ; her mother came in , and learning what had happened , looked narrowly at the sergeant-major . 'We must not let him lie like that , lift him up , ' she said . 'Let him rest in the window-bench on some cushions . ' They unfolded his arms and hands as they lay clasped upon the table , and on lifting his head found his features to bear the very impress of death itself . Bartholomew Miller , who had now come in , assisted Mr. Paddock to make a comfortable couch in the window-seat , where they stretched out Clark upon his back . Still he seemed unconscious . 'We must get a doctor , ' said Selina . ' O , my dear John , how is it you be taken like this ? ' 'My impression is that he 's dead ! ' murmured Mr. Paddock . 'He don't breathe enough to move a tomtit 's feather . ' There were plenty to volunteer to go for a doctor , but as it would be at least an hour before he could get there the case seemed somewhat hopeless . The dancing-party ended as unceremoniously as it had begun ; but the guests lingered round the premises till the doctor should arrive . When he did come the sergeant-major 's extremities were already cold , and there was no doubt that death had overtaken him almost at the moment that he had sat down . The medical practitioner quite refused to accept the unhappy Selina's theory that her revelation had in any way induced Clark 's sudden collapse . Both he and the coroner afterwards , who found the immediate cause to be heart-failure , held that such a supposition was unwarranted by facts . They asserted that a long day 's journey , a hurried drive , and then an exhausting dance , were sufficient for such a result upon a heart enfeebled by fatty degeneration after the privations of a Crimean winter and other trying experiences , the coincidence of the sad event with any disclosure of hers being a pure accident . This conclusion , however , did not dislodge Selina 's opinion that the shock of her statement had been the immediate stroke which had felled a constitution so undermined . V At this date the Casterbridge Barracks were cavalry quarters , their adaptation to artillery having been effected some years later . It had been owing to the fact that the -- -th Dragoons , in which John Clark had served , happened to be lying there that Selina made his acquaintance . At the time of his death the barracks were occupied by the Scots Greys , but when the pathetic circumstances of the sergeant-major 's end became known in the town the officers of the Greys offered the services of their fine reed and brass band , that he might have a funeral marked by due military honours . His body was accordingly removed to the barracks , and carried thence to the churchyard in the Durnover quarter on the following afternoon , one of the Greys ' most ancient and docile chargers being blacked up to represent Clark 's horse on the occasion . Everybody pitied Selina , whose story was well known . She followed the corpse as the only mourner , Clark having been without relations in this part of the country , and a communication with his regiment having brought none from a distance . She sat in a little shabby brown-black mourning carriage , squeezing herself up in a corner to be as much as possible out of sight during the slow and dramatic march through the town to the tune from Saul . When the interment had taken place , the volleys been fired , and the return journey begun , it was with something like a shock that she found the military escort to be moving at a quick march to the lively strains of 'Off she goes ! ' as if all care for the sergeant-major was expected to be ended with the late discharge of the carbines . It was , by chance , the very tune to which they had been footing when he died , and unable to bear its notes , she hastily told her driver to drop behind . The band and military party diminished up the High Street , and Selina turned over Swan bridge and homeward to Mellstock . Then recommenced for her a life whose incidents were precisely of a suit with those which had preceded the soldier 's return ; but how different in her appreciation of them ! Her narrow miss of the recovered respectability they had hoped for from that tardy event worked upon her parents as an irritant , and after the first week or two of her mourning her life with them grew almost insupportable . She had impulsively taken to herself the weeds of a widow , for such she seemed to herself to be , and clothed little Johnny in sables likewise . This assumption of a moral relationship to the deceased , which she asserted to be only not a legal one by two most unexpected accidents , led the old people to indulge in sarcasm at her expense whenever they beheld her attire , though all the while it cost them more pain to utter than it gave her to hear it . Having become accustomed by her residence at home to the business carried on by her father , she surprised them one day by going off with the child to Chalk-Newton , in the direction of the town of Ivell , and opening a miniature fruit and vegetable shop , attending Ivell market with her produce . Her business grew somewhat larger , and it was soon sufficient to enable her to support herself and the boy in comfort . She called herself 'Mrs . John Clark ' from the day of leaving home , and painted the name on her signboard -- no man forbidding her . By degrees the pain of her state was forgotten in her new circumstances , and getting to be generally accepted as the widow of a sergeant-major of dragoons -- an assumption which her modest and mournful demeanour seemed to substantiate -- her life became a placid one , her mind being nourished by the melancholy luxury of dreaming what might have been her future in New Zealand with John , if he had only lived to take her there . Her only travels now were a journey to Ivell on market-days , and once a fortnight to the churchyard in which Clark lay , there to tend , with Johnny's assistance , as widows are wont to do , the flowers she had planted upon his grave . On a day about eighteen months after his unexpected decease , Selina was surprised in her lodging over her little shop by a visit from Bartholomew Miller . He had called on her once or twice before , on which occasions he had used without a word of comment the name by which she was known . ' I 've come this time , ' he said , 'less because I was in this direction than to ask you , Mrs. Clark , what you mid well guess . I 've come o' purpose , in short . ' She smiled . ''Tis to ask me again to marry you ? ' 'Yes , of course . You see , his coming back for 'ee proved what I always believed of 'ee , though others did n't . There 's nobody but would be glad to welcome you to our parish again , now you 've showed your independence and acted up to your trust in his promise . Well , my dear , will you come ? ' ' I 'd rather bide as Mrs. Clark , I think , ' she answered . ' I am not ashamed of my position at all ; for I am John 's widow in the eyes of Heaven . ' ' I quite agree -- that 's why I 've come . Still , you wo n't like to be always straining at this shop-keeping and market-standing ; and 'twould be better for Johnny if you had nothing to do but tend him . ' He here touched the only weak spot in Selina 's resistance to his proposal -- the good of the boy . To promote that there were other men she might have married offhand without loving them if they had asked her to ; but though she had known the worthy speaker from her youth , she could not for the moment fancy herself happy as Mrs. Miller . He paused awhile . ' I ought to tell 'ee , Mrs. Clark , ' he said by and by , 'that marrying is getting to be a pressing question with me . Not on my own account at all . The truth is , that mother is growing old , and I am away from home a good deal , so that it is almost necessary there should be another person in the house with her besides me . That 's the practical consideration which forces me to think of taking a wife , apart from my wish to take you ; and you know there 's nobody in the world I care for so much . ' She said something about there being far better women than she , and other natural commonplaces ; but assured him she was most grateful to him for feeling what he felt , as indeed she sincerely was . However , Selina would not consent to be the useful third person in his comfortable home -- at any rate just then . He went away , after taking tea with her , without discerning much hope for him in her good-bye . VI After that evening she saw and heard nothing of him for a great while . Her fortnightly journeys to the sergeant-major 's grave were continued , whenever weather did not hinder them ; and Mr. Miller must have known , she thought , of this custom of hers . But though the churchyard was not nearly so far from his homestead as was her shop at Chalk-Newton , he never appeared in the accidental way that lovers use . An explanation was forthcoming in the shape of a letter from her mother , who casually mentioned that Mr. Bartholomew Miller had gone away to the other side of Shottsford-Forum to be married to a thriving dairyman's daughter that he knew there . His chief motive , it was reported , had been less one of love than a wish to provide a companion for his aged mother . Selina was practical enough to know that she had lost a good and possibly the only opportunity of settling in life after what had happened , and for a moment she regretted her independence . But she became calm on reflection , and to fortify herself in her course started that afternoon to tend the sergeant-major 's grave , in which she took the same sober pleasure as at first . On reaching the churchyard and turning the corner towards the spot as usual , she was surprised to perceive another woman , also apparently a respectable widow , and with a tiny boy by her side , bending over Clark's turf , and spudding up with the point of her umbrella some ivy-roots that Selina had reverently planted there to form an evergreen mantle over the mound . 'What are you digging up my ivy for ! ' cried Selina , rushing forward so excitedly that Johnny tumbled over a grave with the force of the tug she gave his hand in her sudden start . 'Your ivy ? ' said the respectable woman . 'Why yes ! I planted it there -- on my husband 's grave . ' 'Your husband 's ! ' 'Yes . The late Sergeant-Major Clark . Anyhow , as good as my husband , for he was just going to be . ' 'Indeed . But who may be my husband , if not he ? I am the only Mrs. John Clark , widow of the late Sergeant-Major of Dragoons , and this is his only son and heir . ' 'How can that be ? ' faltered Selina , her throat seeming to stick together as she just began to perceive its possibility . 'He had been -- going to marry me twice -- and we were going to New Zealand . ' 'Ah ! -- I remember about you , ' returned the legitimate widow calmly and not unkindly . 'You must be Selina ; he spoke of you now and then , and said that his relations with you would always be a weight on his conscience . Well ; the history of my life with him is soon told . When he came back from the Crimea he became acquainted with me at my home in the north , and we were married within a month of first knowing each other . Unfortunately , after living together a few months , we could not agree ; and after a particularly sharp quarrel , in which , perhaps , I was most in the wrong -- as I do n't mind owning here by his graveside -- he went away from me , declaring he would buy his discharge and emigrate to New Zealand , and never come back to me any more . The next thing I heard was that he had died suddenly at Mellstock at some low carouse ; and as he had left me in such anger to live no more with me , I would n't come down to his funeral , or do anything in relation to him . 'T was temper , I know , but that was the fact . Even if we had parted friends it would have been a serious expense to travel three hundred miles to get there , for one who was n't left so very well off . . . I am sorry I pulled up your ivy-roots ; but that common sort of ivy is considered a weed in my part of the country . ' December 1899 . A TRYST AT AN ANCIENT EARTH WORK At one 's every step forward it rises higher against the south sky , with an obtrusive personality that compels the senses to regard it and consider . The eyes may bend in another direction , but never without the consciousness of its heavy , high-shouldered presence at its point of vantage . Across the intervening levels the gale races in a straight line from the fort , as if breathed out of it hitherward . With the shifting of the clouds the faces of the steeps vary in colour and in shade , broad lights appearing where mist and vagueness had prevailed , dissolving in their turn into melancholy gray , which spreads over and eclipses the luminous bluffs . In this so-thought immutable spectacle all is change . Out of the invisible marine region on the other side birds soar suddenly into the air , and hang over the summits of the heights with the indifference of long familiarity . Their forms are white against the tawny concave of cloud , and the curves they exhibit in their floating signify that they are sea-gulls which have journeyed inland from expected stress of weather . As the birds rise behind the fort , so do the clouds rise behind the birds , almost as it seems , stroking with their bagging bosoms the uppermost flyers . The profile of the whole stupendous ruin , as seen at a distance of a mile eastward , is cleanly cut as that of a marble inlay . It is varied with protuberances , which from hereabouts have the animal aspect of warts , wens , knuckles , and hips . It may indeed be likened to an enormous many- limbed organism of an antediluvian time -- partaking of the cephalopod in shape -- lying lifeless , and covered with a thin green cloth , which hides its substance , while revealing its contour . This dull green mantle of herbage stretches down towards the levels , where the ploughs have essayed for centuries to creep up near and yet nearer to the base of the castle , but have always stopped short before reaching it . The furrows of these environing attempts show themselves distinctly , bending to the incline as they trench upon it ; mounting in steeper curves , till the steepness baffles them , and their parallel threads show like the striae of waves pausing on the curl . The peculiar place of which these are some of the features is 'Mai-Dun , ' 'The Castle of the Great Hill , ' said to be the Dunium of Ptolemy , the capital of the Durotriges , which eventually came into Roman occupation , and was finally deserted on their withdrawal from the island . * * * * * The evening is followed by a night on which an invisible moon bestows a subdued , yet pervasive light -- without radiance , as without blackness . From the spot whereon I am ensconced in a cottage , a mile away , the fort has now ceased to be visible ; yet , as by day , to anybody whose thoughts have been engaged with it and its barbarous grandeurs of past time the form asserts its existence behind the night gauzes as persistently as if it had a voice . Moreover , the south-west wind continues to feed the intervening arable flats with vapours brought directly from its sides . The midnight hour for which there has been occasion to wait at length arrives , and I journey towards the stronghold in obedience to a request urged earlier in the day . It concerns an appointment , which I rather regret my decision to keep now that night is come . The route thither is hedgeless and treeless -- I need not add deserted . The moonlight is sufficient to disclose the pale riband-like surface of the way as it trails along between the expanses of darker fallow . Though the road passes near the fortress it does not conduct directly to its fronts . As the place is without an inhabitant , so it is without a trackway . So presently leaving the macadamized road to pursue its course elsewhither , I step off upon the fallow , and plod stumblingly across it . The castle looms out off the shade by degrees , like a thing waking up and asking what I want there . It is now so enlarged by nearness that its whole shape can not be taken in at one view . The ploughed ground ends as the rise sharpens , the sloping basement of grass begins , and I climb upward to invade Mai-Dun . Impressive by day as this largest Ancient-British work in the kingdom undoubtedly is , its impressiveness is increased now . After standing still and spending a few minutes in adding its age to its size , and its size to its solitude , it becomes appallingly mournful in its growing closeness . A squally wind blows in the face with an impact which proclaims that the vapours of the air sail low to-night .

For aid in reclaiming some of the narratives I express my thanks to the proprietors and editors of the newspapers and magazines in whose pages they first appeared . T. H. August 1913 . A CHANGED MAN CHAPTER I The person who , next to the actors themselves , chanced to know most of their story , lived just below 'Top o ' Town ' ( as the spot was called ) in an old substantially-built house , distinguished among its neighbours by having an oriel window on the first floor , whence could be obtained a raking view of the High Street , west and east , the former including Laura 's dwelling , the end of the Town Avenue hard by ( in which were played the odd pranks hereafter to be mentioned ) , the Port-Bredy road rising westwards , and the turning that led to the cavalry barracks where the Captain was quartered . Looking eastward down the town from the same favoured gazebo , the long perspective of houses declined and dwindled till they merged in the highway across the moor . The white riband of road disappeared over Grey 's Bridge a quarter of a mile off , to plunge into innumerable rustic windings , shy shades , and solitary undulations up hill and down dale for one hundred and twenty miles till it exhibited itself at Hyde Park Corner as a smooth bland surface in touch with a busy and fashionable world . To the barracks aforesaid had recently arrived the -- -th Hussars , a regiment new to the locality . Almost before any acquaintance with its members had been made by the townspeople , a report spread that they were a 'crack ' body of men , and had brought a splendid band . For some reason or other the town had not been used as the headquarters of cavalry for many years , the various troops stationed there having consisted of casual detachments only ; so that it was with a sense of honour that everybody -- even the small furniture-broker from whom the married troopers hired tables and chairs -- received the news of their crack quality . In those days the Hussar regiments still wore over the left shoulder that attractive attachment , or frilled half-coat , hanging loosely behind like the wounded wing of a bird , which was called the pelisse , though it was known among the troopers themselves as a 'sling-jacket . ' It added amazingly to their picturesqueness in women 's eyes , and , indeed , in the eyes of men also . The burgher who lived in the house with the oriel window sat during a great many hours of the day in that projection , for he was an invalid , and time hung heavily on his hands unless he maintained a constant interest in proceedings without . Not more than a week after the arrival of the Hussars his ears were assailed by the shout of one schoolboy to another in the street below . 'Have 'ee heard this about the Hussars ? They are haunted ! Yes -- a ghost troubles 'em ; he has followed 'em about the world for years . ' A haunted regiment : that was a new idea for either invalid or stalwart . The listener in the oriel came to the conclusion that there were some lively characters among the -- -th Hussars . He made Captain Maumbry 's acquaintance in an informal manner at an afternoon tea to which he went in a wheeled chair -- one of the very rare outings that the state of his health permitted . Maumbry showed himself to be a handsome man of twenty-eight or thirty , with an attractive hint of wickedness in his manner that was sure to make him adorable with good young women . The large dark eyes that lit his pale face expressed this wickedness strongly , though such was the adaptability of their rays that one could think they might have expressed sadness or seriousness just as readily , if he had had a mind for such . An old and deaf lady who was present asked Captain Maumbry bluntly : 'What 's this we hear about you ? They say your regiment is haunted . ' The Captain 's face assumed an aspect of grave , even sad , concern . 'Yes , ' he replied , 'it is too true . ' Some younger ladies smiled till they saw how serious he looked , when they looked serious likewise . 'Really ? ' said the old lady . 'Yes . We naturally do n't wish to say much about it . ' 'No , no ; of course not . But -- how haunted ? ' 'Well ; the -- thing , as I 'll call it , follows us . In country quarters or town , abroad or at home , it 's just the same . ' 'How do you account for it ? ' ' H 'm . ' Maumbry lowered his voice . 'Some crime committed by certain of our regiment in past years , we suppose . ' 'Dear me . . . How very horrid , and singular ! ' 'But , as I said , we do n't speak of it much . ' 'No . . . no . ' When the Hussar was gone , a young lady , disclosing a long-suppressed interest , asked if the ghost had been seen by any of the town . The lawyer 's son , who always had the latest borough news , said that , though it was seldom seen by any one but the Hussars themselves , more than one townsman and woman had already set eyes on it , to his or her terror . The phantom mostly appeared very late at night , under the dense trees of the town-avenue nearest the barracks . It was about ten feet high ; its teeth chattered with a dry naked sound , as if they were those of a skeleton ; and its hip-bones could be heard grating in their sockets . During the darkest weeks of winter several timid persons were seriously frightened by the object answering to this cheerful description , and the police began to look into the matter . Whereupon the appearances grew less frequent , and some of the Boys of the regiment thankfully stated that they had not been so free from ghostly visitation for years as they had become since their arrival in Casterbridge . This playing at ghosts was the most innocent of the amusements indulged in by the choice young spirits who inhabited the lichened , red-brick building at the top of the town bearing ' W.D . ' and a broad arrow on its quoins . Far more serious escapades -- levities relating to love , wine , cards , betting -- were talked of , with no doubt more or less of exaggeration . That the Hussars , Captain Maumbry included , were the cause of bitter tears to several young women of the town and country is unquestionably true , despite the fact that the gaieties of the young men wore a more staring colour in this old-fashioned place than they would have done in a large and modern city . CHAPTER II Regularly once a week they rode out in marching order . Returning up the town on one of these occasions , the romantic pelisse flapping behind each horseman 's shoulder in the soft south-west wind , Captain Maumbry glanced up at the oriel . A mutual nod was exchanged between him and the person who sat there reading . The reader and a friend in the room with him followed the troop with their eyes all the way up the street , till , when the soldiers were opposite the house in which Laura lived , that young lady became discernible in the balcony . 'They are engaged to be married , I hear , ' said the friend . 'Who -- Maumbry and Laura ? Never -- so soon ? ' 'Yes . ' 'He 'll never marry . Several girls have been mentioned in connection with his name . I am sorry for Laura . ' 'Oh , but you need n't be . They are excellently matched . ' 'She 's only one more . ' 'She 's one more , and more still . She has regularly caught him . She is a born player of the game of hearts , and she knew how to beat him in his own practices . If there is one woman in the town who has any chance of holding her own and marrying him , she is that woman . ' This was true , as it turned out . By natural proclivity Laura had from the first entered heart and soul into military romance as exhibited in the plots and characters of those living exponents of it who came under her notice . From her earliest young womanhood civilians , however promising , had no chance of winning her interest if the meanest warrior were within the horizon . It may be that the position of her uncle's house ( which was her home ) at the corner of West Street nearest the barracks , the daily passing of the troops , the constant blowing of trumpet-calls a furlong from her windows , coupled with the fact that she knew nothing of the inner realities of military life , and hence idealized it , had also helped her mind 's original bias for thinking men-at-arms the only ones worthy of a woman 's heart . Captain Maumbry was a typical prize ; one whom all surrounding maidens had coveted , ached for , angled for , wept for , had by her judicious management become subdued to her purpose ; and in addition to the pleasure of marrying the man she loved , Laura had the joy of feeling herself hated by the mothers of all the marriageable girls of the neighbourhood . The man in the oriel went to the wedding ; not as a guest , for at this time he was but slightly acquainted with the parties ; but mainly because the church was close to his house ; partly , too , for a reason which moved many others to be spectators of the ceremony ; a subconsciousness that , though the couple might be happy in their experiences , there was sufficient possibility of their being otherwise to colour the musings of an onlooker with a pleasing pathos of conjecture . He could on occasion do a pretty stroke of rhyming in those days , and he beguiled the time of waiting by pencilling on a blank page of his prayer-book a few lines which , though kept private then , may be given here : - AT A HASTY WEDDING ( Triolet ) If hours be years the twain are blest , For now they solace swift desire By lifelong ties that tether zest If hours be years . The twain are blest Do eastern suns slope never west , Nor pallid ashes follow fire . If hours be years the twain are blest For now they solace swift desire . As if , however , to falsify all prophecies , the couple seemed to find in marriage the secret of perpetuating the intoxication of a courtship which , on Maumbry 's side at least , had opened without serious intent . During the winter following they were the most popular pair in and about Casterbridge -- nay in South Wessex itself . No smart dinner in the country houses of the younger and gayer families within driving distance of the borough was complete without their lively presence ; Mrs. Maumbry was the blithest of the whirling figures at the county ball ; and when followed that inevitable incident of garrison-town life , an amateur dramatic entertainment , it was just the same . The acting was for the benefit of such and such an excellent charity -- nobody cared what , provided the play were played -- and both Captain Maumbry and his wife were in the piece , having been in fact , by mutual consent , the originators of the performance . And so with laughter , and thoughtlessness , and movement , all went merrily . There was a little backwardness in the bill-paying of the couple ; but in justice to them it must be added that sooner or later all owings were paid . CHAPTER III At the chapel-of-ease attended by the troops there arose above the edge of the pulpit one Sunday an unknown face . This was the face of a new curate . He placed upon the desk , not the familiar sermon book , but merely a Bible . The person who tells these things was not present at that service , but he soon learnt that the young curate was nothing less than a great surprise to his congregation ; a mixed one always , for though the Hussars occupied the body of the building , its nooks and corners were crammed with civilians , whom , up to the present , even the least uncharitable would have described as being attracted thither less by the services than by the soldiery . Now there arose a second reason for squeezing into an already overcrowded church . The persuasive and gentle eloquence of Mr. Sainway operated like a charm upon those accustomed only to the higher and dryer styles of preaching , and for a time the other churches of the town were thinned of their sitters . At this point in the nineteenth century the sermon was the sole reason for churchgoing amongst a vast body of religious people . The liturgy was a formal preliminary , which , like the Royal proclamation in a court of assize , had to be got through before the real interest began ; and on reaching home the question was simply : Who preached , and how did he handle his subject ? Even had an archbishop officiated in the service proper nobody would have cared much about what was said or sung . People who had formerly attended in the morning only began to go in the evening , and even to the special addresses in the afternoon . One day when Captain Maumbry entered his wife 's drawing-room , filled with hired furniture , she thought he was somebody else , for he had not come upstairs humming the most catching air afloat in musical circles or in his usual careless way . 'What 's the matter , Jack ? ' she said without looking up from a note she was writing . 'Well -- not much , that I know . ' ' O , but there is , ' she murmured as she wrote . 'Why -- this cursed new lath in a sheet -- I mean the new parson ! He wants us to stop the band-playing on Sunday afternoons . ' Laura looked up aghast . 'Why , it is the one thing that enables the few rational beings hereabouts to keep alive from Saturday to Monday ! ' 'He says all the town flock to the music and do n't come to the service , and that the pieces played are profane , or mundane , or inane , or something -- not what ought to be played on Sunday . Of course 't is Lautmann who settles those things . ' Lautmann was the bandmaster . The barrack-green on Sunday afternoons had , indeed , become the promenade of a great many townspeople cheerfully inclined , many even of those who attended in the morning at Mr. Sainway 's service ; and little boys who ought to have been listening to the curate 's afternoon lecture were too often seen rolling upon the grass and making faces behind the more dignified listeners . Laura heard no more about the matter , however , for two or three weeks , when suddenly remembering it she asked her husband if any further objections had been raised . ' O -- Mr. Sainway . I forgot to tell you . I 've made his acquaintance . He is not a bad sort of man . ' Laura asked if either Maumbry or some others of the officers did not give the presumptuous curate a good setting down for his interference . ' O well -- we 've forgotten that . He 's a stunning preacher , they tell me . ' The acquaintance developed apparently , for the Captain said to her a little later on , 'There 's a good deal in Sainway 's argument about having no band on Sunday afternoons . After all , it is close to his church . But he does n't press his objections unduly . ' ' I am surprised to hear you defend him ! ' 'It was only a passing thought of mine . We naturally do n't wish to offend the inhabitants of the town if they do n't like it . ' 'But they do . ' The invalid in the oriel never clearly gathered the details of progress in this conflict of lay and clerical opinion ; but so it was that , to the disappointment of musicians , the grief of out-walking lovers , and the regret of the junior population of the town and country round , the band- playing on Sunday afternoons ceased in Casterbridge barrack-square . By this time the Maumbrys had frequently listened to the preaching of the gentle if narrow-minded curate ; for these light-natured , hit-or-miss , rackety people went to church like others for respectability 's sake . None so orthodox as your unmitigated worldling . A more remarkable event was the sight to the man in the window of Captain Maumbry and Mr. Sainway walking down the High Street in earnest conversation . On his mentioning this fact to a caller he was assured that it was a matter of common talk that they were always together . The observer would soon have learnt this with his own eyes if he had not been told . They began to pass together nearly every day . Hitherto Mrs. Maumbry , in fashionable walking clothes , had usually been her husband's companion ; but this was less frequent now . The close and singular friendship between the two men went on for nearly a year , when Mr. Sainway was presented to a living in a densely-populated town in the midland counties . He bade the parishioners of his old place a reluctant farewell and departed , the touching sermon he preached on the occasion being published by the local printer . Everybody was sorry to lose him ; and it was with genuine grief that his Casterbridge congregation learnt later on that soon after his induction to his benefice , during some bitter weather , he had fallen seriously ill of inflammation of the lungs , of which he eventually died . We now get below the surface of things . Of all who had known the dead curate , none grieved for him like the man who on his first arrival had called him a 'lath in a sheet . ' Mrs. Maumbry had never greatly sympathized with the impressive parson ; indeed , she had been secretly glad that he had gone away to better himself . He had considerably diminished the pleasures of a woman by whom the joys of earth and good company had been appreciated to the full . Sorry for her husband in his loss of a friend who had been none of hers , she was yet quite unprepared for the sequel . 'There is something that I have wanted to tell you lately , dear , ' he said one morning at breakfast with hesitation . 'Have you guessed what it is ? ' She had guessed nothing . 'That I think of retiring from the army . ' 'What ! ' ' I have thought more and more of Sainway since his death , and of what he used to say to me so earnestly . And I feel certain I shall be right in obeying a call within me to give up this fighting trade and enter the Church . ' 'What -- be a parson ? ' 'Yes . ' 'But what should I do ? ' 'Be a parson 's wife . ' 'Never ! ' she affirmed . 'But how can you help it ? ' ' I 'll run away rather ! ' she said vehemently ; 'No , you must n't , ' Maumbry replied , in the tone he used when his mind was made up . 'You 'll get accustomed to the idea , for I am constrained to carry it out , though it is against my worldly interests . I am forced on by a Hand outside me to tread in the steps of Sainway . ' 'Jack , ' she asked , with calm pallor and round eyes ; 'do you mean to say seriously that you are arranging to be a curate instead of a soldier ? ' ' I might say a curate is a soldier -- of the church militant ; but I don't want to offend you with doctrine . I distinctly say , yes . ' Late one evening , a little time onward , he caught her sitting by the dim firelight in her room . She did not know he had entered ; and he found her weeping . 'What are you crying about , poor dearest ? ' he said . She started . 'Because of what you have told me ! ' The Captain grew very unhappy ; but he was undeterred . In due time the town learnt , to its intense surprise , that Captain Maumbry had retired from the -- -th Hussars and gone to Fountall Theological College to prepare for the ministry . CHAPTER IV ' O , the pity of it ! Such a dashing soldier -- so popular -- such an acquisition to the town -- the soul of social life here ! And now ! . . . One should not speak ill of the dead , but that dreadful Mr. Sainway -- it was too cruel of him ! ' This is a summary of what was said when Captain , now the Reverend , John Maumbry was enabled by circumstances to indulge his heart 's desire of returning to the scene of his former exploits in the capacity of a minister of the Gospel . A low-lying district of the town , which at that date was crowded with impoverished cottagers , was crying for a curate , and Mr. Maumbry generously offered himself as one willing to undertake labours that were certain to produce little result , and no thanks , credit , or emolument . Let the truth be told about him as a clergyman ; he proved to be anything but a brilliant success . Painstaking , single-minded , deeply in earnest as all could see , his delivery was laboured , his sermons were dull to listen to , and alas , too , too long . Even the dispassionate judges who sat by the hour in the bar-parlour of the White Hart -- an inn standing at the dividing line between the poor quarter aforesaid and the fashionable quarter of Maumbry 's former triumphs , and hence affording a position of strict impartiality -- agreed in substance with the young ladies to the westward , though their views were somewhat more tersely expressed : 'Surely , God A'mighty spwiled a good sojer to make a bad pa'son when He shifted Cap ' n Ma'mbry into a sarpless ! ' The latter knew that such things were said , but he pursued his daily' labours in and out of the hovels with serene unconcern . It was about this time that the invalid in the oriel became more than a mere bowing acquaintance of Mrs. Maumbry 's . She had returned to the town with her husband , and was living with him in a little house in the centre of his circle of ministration , when by some means she became one of the invalid 's visitors . After a general conversation while sitting in his room with a friend of both , an incident led up to the matter that still rankled deeply in her soul . Her face was now paler and thinner than it had been ; even more attractive , her disappointments having inscribed themselves as meek thoughtfulness on a look that was once a little frivolous . The two ladies had called to be allowed to use the window for observing the departure of the Hussars , who were leaving for barracks much nearer to London . The troopers turned the corner of Barrack Road into the top of High Street , headed by their band playing 'The girl I left behind me ' ( which was formerly always the tune for such times , though it is now nearly disused ) . They came and passed the oriel , where an officer or two , looking up and discovering Mrs. Maumbry , saluted her , whose eyes filled with tears as the notes of the band waned away . Before the little group had recovered from that sense of the romantic which such spectacles impart , Mr. Maumbry came along the pavement . He probably had bidden his former brethren-in-arms a farewell at the top of the street , for he walked from that direction in his rather shabby clerical clothes , and with a basket on his arm which seemed to hold some purchases he had been making for his poorer parishioners . Unlike the soldiers he went along quite unconscious of his appearance or of the scene around . The contrast was too much for Laura . With lips that now quivered , she asked the invalid what he thought of the change that had come to her . It was difficult to answer , and with a wilfulness that was too strong in her she repeated the question . 'Do you think , ' she added , 'that a woman 's husband has a right to do such a thing , even if he does feel a certain call to it ? ' Her listener sympathized too largely with both of them to be anything but unsatisfactory in his reply . Laura gazed longingly out of the window towards the thin dusty line of Hussars , now smalling towards the Mellstock Ridge . ' I , ' she said , 'who should have been in their van on the way to London , am doomed to fester in a hole in Durnover Lane ! ' Many events had passed and many rumours had been current concerning her before the invalid saw her again after her leave-taking that day . CHAPTER V Casterbridge had known many military and civil episodes ; many happy times , and times less happy ; and now came the time of her visitation . The scourge of cholera had been laid on the suffering country , and the low- lying purlieus of this ancient borough had more than their share of the infliction . Mixen Lane , in the Durnover quarter , and in Maumbry's parish , was where the blow fell most heavily . Yet there was a certain mercy in its choice of a date , for Maumbry was the man for such an hour . The spread of the epidemic was so rapid that many left the town and took lodgings in the villages and farms . Mr. Maumbry 's house was close to the most infected street , and he himself was occupied morn , noon , and night in endeavours to stamp out the plague and in alleviating the sufferings of the victims . So , as a matter of ordinary precaution , he decided to isolate his wife somewhere away from him for a while . She suggested a village by the sea , near Budmouth Regis , and lodgings were obtained for her at Creston , a spot divided from the Casterbridge valley by a high ridge that gave it quite another atmosphere , though it lay no more than six miles off . Thither she went . While she was rusticating in this place of safety , and her husband was slaving in the slums ,",A Changed Man And Other Tales
Hector Hugh,"the votive offering . `` I suppose it was your doing , '' she observed ; `` it 's a harmless piece of lunacy , but people would think you dreadfully silly if they knew of it . '' `` Did you meddle with it in any way ? '' asked Mortimer . `` I -- I threw the grapes away . It seemed so silly , '' said Sylvia , watching Mortimer 's impassive face for a sign of annoyance . `` I do n't think you were wise to do that , '' he said reflectively . `` I've heard it said that the Wood Gods are rather horrible to those who molest them . '' `` Horrible perhaps to those that believe in them , but you see I do n't , '' retorted Sylvia . `` All the same , '' said Mortimer in his even , dispassionate tone , `` I should avoid the woods and orchards if I were you , and give a wide berth to the horned beasts on the farm . '' It was all nonsense , of course , but in that lonely wood-girt spot nonsense seemed able to rear a bastard brood of uneasiness . `` Mortimer , '' said Sylvia suddenly , `` I think we will go back to Town some time soon . '' Her victory had not been so complete as she had supposed ; it had carried her on to ground that she was already anxious to quit . `` I do n't think you will ever go back to Town , '' said Mortimer . He seemed to be paraphrasing his mother 's prediction as to himself . Sylvia noted with dissatisfaction and some self-contempt that the course of her next afternoon 's ramble took her instinctively clear of the network of woods . As to the horned cattle , Mortimer 's warning was scarcely needed , for she had always regarded them as of doubtful neutrality at the best : her imagination unsexed the most matronly dairy cows and turned them into bulls liable to `` see red '' at any moment . The ram who fed in the narrow paddock below the orchards she had adjudged , after ample and cautious probation , to be of docile temper ; to-day , however , she decided to leave his docility untested , for the usually tranquil beast was roaming with every sign of restlessness from corner to corner of his meadow . A low , fitful piping , as of some reedy flute , was coming from the depth of a neighbouring copse , and there seemed to be some subtle connection between the animal 's restless pacing and the wild music from the wood . Sylvia turned her steps in an upward direction and climbed the heather-clad slopes that stretched in rolling shoulders high above Yessney . She had left the piping notes behind her , but across the wooded combes at her feet the wind brought her another kind of music , the straining bay of hounds in full chase . Yessney was just on the outskirts of the Devon-and-Somerset country , and the hunted deer sometimes came that way . Sylvia could presently see a dark body , breasting hill after hill , and sinking again and again out of sight as he crossed the combes , while behind him steadily swelled that relentless chorus , and she grew tense with the excited sympathy that one feels for any hunted thing in whose capture one is not directly interested . And at last he broke through the outermost line of oak scrub and fern and stood panting in the open , a fat September stag carrying a well-furnished head . His obvious course was to drop down to the brown pools of Undercombe , and thence make his way towards the red deer 's favoured sanctuary , the sea . To Sylvia 's surprise , however , he turned his head to the upland slope and came lumbering resolutely onward over the heather . `` It will be dreadful , '' she thought , `` the hounds will pull him down under my very eyes . '' But the music of the pack seemed to have died away for a moment , and in its place she heard again that wild piping , which rose now on this side , now on that , as though urging the failing stag to a final effort . Sylvia stood well aside from his path , half hidden in a thick growth of whortle bushes , and watched him swing stiffly upward , his flanks dark with sweat , the coarse hair on his neck showing light by contrast . The pipe music shrilled suddenly around her , seeming to come from the bushes at her very feet , and at the same moment the great beast slewed round and bore directly down upon her . In an instant her pity for the hunted animal was changed to wild terror at her own danger ; the thick heather roots mocked her scrambling efforts at flight , and she looked frantically downward for a glimpse of oncoming hounds . The huge antler spikes were within a few yards of her , and in a flash of numbing fear she remembered Mortimer 's warning , to beware of horned beasts on the farm . And then with a quick throb of joy she saw that she was not alone ; a human figure stood a few paces aside , knee-deep in the whortle bushes . `` Drive it off ! '' she shrieked . But the figure made no answering movement . The antlers drove straight at her breast , the acrid smell of the hunted animal was in her nostrils , but her eyes were filled with the horror of something she saw other than her oncoming death . And in her ears rang the echo of a boy 's laughter , golden and equivocal . THE STORY OF ST. VESPALUUS '' Tell me a story , '' said the Baroness , staring out despairingly at the rain ; it was that light , apologetic sort of rain that looks as if it was going to leave off every minute and goes on for the greater part of the afternoon . `` What sort of story ? '' asked Clovis , giving his croquet mallet a valedictory shove into retirement . `` One just true enough to be interesting and not true enough to be tiresome , '' said the Baroness . Clovis rearranged several cushions to his personal solace and satisfaction ; he knew that the Baroness liked her guests to be comfortable , and he thought it right to respect her wishes in that particular . `` Have I ever told you the story of Saint Vespaluus ? '' he asked . `` You 've told me stories about grand-dukes and lion-tamers and financiers ' widows and a postmaster in Herzegovina , '' said the Baroness , '' and about an Italian jockey and an amateur governess who went to Warsaw , and several about your mother , but certainly never anything about a saint . '' `` This story happened a long while ago , '' he said , `` in those uncomfortable piebald times when a third of the people were Pagan , and a third Christian , and the biggest third of all just followed whichever religion the Court happened to profess . There was a certain king called Hkrikros , who had a fearful temper and no immediate successor in his own family ; his married sister , however , had provided him with a large stock of nephews from which to select his heir . And the most eligible and royally-approved of all these nephews was the sixteen-year-old Vespaluus . He was the best looking , and the best horseman and javelin-thrower , and had that priceless princely gift of being able to walk past a supplicant with an air of not having seen him , but would certainly have given something if he had . My mother has that gift to a certain extent ; she can go smilingly and financially unscathed through a charity bazaar , and meet the organizers next day with a solicitous 'had I but known you were in need of funds ' air that is really rather a triumph in audacity . Now Hkrikros was a Pagan of the first water , and kept the worship of the sacred serpents , who lived in a hallowed grove on a hill near the royal palace , up to a high pitch of enthusiasm . The common people were allowed to please themselves , within certain discreet limits , in the matter of private religion , but any official in the service of the Court who went over to the new cult was looked down on , literally as well as metaphorically , the looking down being done from the gallery that ran round the royal bear-pit . Consequently there was considerable scandal and consternation when the youthful Vespaluus appeared one day at a Court function with a rosary tucked into his belt , and announced in reply to angry questionings that he had decided to adopt Christianity , or at any rate to give it a trial . If it had been any of the other nephews the king would possibly have ordered something drastic in the way of scourging and banishment , but in the case of the favoured Vespaluus he determined to look on the whole thing much as a modern father might regard the announced intention of his son to adopt the stage as a profession . He sent accordingly for the Royal Librarian . The royal library in those days was not a very extensive affair , and the keeper of the king 's books had a great deal of leisure on his hands . Consequently he was in frequent demand for the settlement of other people 's affairs when these strayed beyond normal limits and got temporarily unmanageable . `` 'You must reason with Prince Vespaluus , ' said the king , 'and impress on him the error of his ways . We can not have the heir to the throne setting such a dangerous example . ' `` 'But where shall I find the necessary arguments ? ' asked the Librarian . `` ' I give you free leave to pick and choose your arguments in the royal woods and coppices , ' said the king ; 'if you can not get together some cutting observations and stinging retorts suitable to the occasion you are a person of very poor resource . ' `` So the Librarian went into the woods and gathered a goodly selection of highly argumentative rods and switches , and then proceeded to reason with Vespaluus on the folly and iniquity and above all the unseemliness of his conduct . His reasoning left a deep impression on the young prince , an impression which lasted for many weeks , during which time nothing more was heard about the unfortunate lapse into Christianity . Then a further scandal of the same nature agitated the Court . At a time when he should have been engaged in audibly invoking the gracious protection and patronage of the holy serpents , Vespaluus was heard singing a chant in honour of St. Odilo of Cluny . The king was furious at this new outbreak , and began to take a gloomy view of the situation ; Vespaluus was evidently going to show a dangerous obstinacy in persisting in his heresy . And yet there was nothing in his appearance to justify such perverseness ; he had not the pale eye of the fanatic or the mystic look of the dreamer . On the contrary , he was quite the best-looking boy at Court ; he had an elegant , well-knit figure , a healthy complexion , eyes the colour of very ripe mulberries , and dark hair , smooth and very well cared for . '' `` It sounds like a description of what you imagine yourself to have been like at the age of sixteen , '' said the Baroness . `` My mother has probably been showing you some of my early photographs , '' said Clovis . Having turned the sarcasm into a compliment , he resumed his story . `` The king had Vespaluus shut up in a dark tower for three days , with nothing but bread and water to live on , the squealing and fluttering of bats to listen to , and drifting clouds to watch through one little window slit . The anti-Pagan section of the community began to talk portentously of the boy-martyr . The martyrdom was mitigated , as far as the food was concerned , by the carelessness of the tower warden , who once or twice left a portion of his own supper of broiled meat and fruit and wine by mistake in the prince 's cell . After the punishment was over , Vespaluus was closely watched for any further symptom of religious perversity , for the king was determined to stand no more opposition on so important a matter , even from a favourite nephew . If there was any more of this nonsense , he said , the succession to the throne would have to be altered . `` For a time all went well ; the festival of summer sports was approaching , and the young Vespaluus was too engrossed in wrestling and foot-running and javelin-throwing competitions to bother himself with the strife of conflicting religious systems . Then , however , came the great culminating feature of the summer festival , the ceremonial dance round the grove of the sacred serpents , and Vespaluus , as we should say , 'sat it out . ' The affront to the State religion was too public and ostentatious to be overlooked , even if the king had been so minded , and he was not in the least so minded . For a day and a half he sat apart and brooded , and every one thought he was debating within himself the question of the young prince 's death or pardon ; as a matter of fact he was merely thinking out the manner of the boy 's death . As the thing had to be done , and was bound to attract an enormous amount of public attention in any case , it was as well to make it as spectacular and impressive as possible . `` 'Apart from his unfortunate taste in religions ; ' said the king , 'and his obstinacy in adhering to it , he is a sweet and pleasant youth , therefore it is meet and fitting that he should be done to death by the winged envoys of sweetness . ' `` 'Your Majesty means -- ? ' said the Royal Librarian . `` ' I mean , ' said the king , 'that he shall be stung to death by bees . By the royal bees , of course . ' `` ' A most elegant death , ' said the Librarian . `` 'Elegant and spectacular , and decidedly painful , ' said the king ; 'it fulfils all the conditions that could be wished for . ' `` The king himself thought out all the details of the execution ceremony . Vespaluus was to be stripped of his clothes , his hands were to be bound behind him , and he was then to be slung in a recumbent position immediately above three of the largest of the royal beehives , so that the least movement of his body would bring him in jarring contact with them . The rest could be safely left to the bees . The death throes , the king computed , might last anything from fifteen to forty minutes , though there was division of opinion and considerable wagering among the other nephews as to whether death might not be almost instantaneous , or , on the other hand , whether it might not be deferred for a couple of hours . Anyway , they all agreed , it was vastly preferable to being thrown down into an evil smelling bear-pit and being clawed and mauled to death by imperfectly carnivorous animals . `` It so happened , however , that the keeper of the royal hives had leanings towards Christianity himself , and moreover , like most of the Court officials , he was very much attached to Vespaluus . On the eve of the execution , therefore , he busied himself with removing the stings from all the royal bees ; it was a long and delicate operation , but he was an expert bee-master , and by working hard nearly all night he succeeded in disarming all , or almost all , of the hive inmates . '' `` I did n't know you could take the sting from a live bee , '' said the Baroness incredulously . `` Every profession has its secrets , '' replied Clovis ; `` if it had n't it would n't be a profession . Well , the moment for the execution arrived ; the king and Court took their places , and accommodation was found for as many of the populace as wished to witness the unusual spectacle . Fortunately the royal bee-yard was of considerable dimensions , and was commanded , moreover , by the terraces that ran round the royal gardens ; with a little squeezing and the erection of a few platforms room was found for everybody . Vespaluus was carried into the open space in front of the hives , blushing and slightly embarrassed , but not at all displeased at the attention which was being centred on him . '' `` He seems to have resembled you in more things than in appearance , '' said the Baroness . `` Do n't interrupt at a critical point in the story , '' said Clovis . `` As soon as he had been carefully adjusted in the prescribed position over the hives , and almost before the gaolers had time to retire to a safe distance , Vespaluus gave a lusty and well-aimed kick , which sent all three hives toppling one over another . The next moment he was wrapped from head to foot in bees ; each individual insect nursed the dreadful and humiliating knowledge that in this supreme hour of catastrophe it could not sting , but each felt that it ought to pretend to . Vespaluus squealed and wriggled with laughter , for he was being tickled nearly to death , and now and again he gave a furious kick and used a bad word as one of the few bees that had escaped disarmament got its protest home . But the spectators saw with amazement that he showed no signs of approaching death agony , and as the bees dropped wearily away in clusters from his body his flesh was seen to be as white and smooth as before the ordeal , with a shiny glaze from the honey-smear of innumerable bee-feet , and here and there a small red spot where one of the rare stings had left its mark . It was obvious that a miracle had been performed in his favour , and one loud murmur , of astonishment or exultation , rose from the onlooking crowd . The king gave orders for Vespaluus to be taken down to await further orders , and stalked silently back to his midday meal , at which he was careful to eat heartily and drink copiously as though nothing unusual had happened . After dinner he sent for the Royal Librarian . `` 'What is the meaning of this fiasco ? ' he demanded . `` 'Your Majesty , ' said that official , 'either there is something radically wrong with the bees -- ' '' 'There is nothing wrong with my bees , ' said the king haughtily , 'they are the best bees . ' `` 'Or else , ' said the Librarian , 'there is something irremediably right about Prince Vespaluus . ' `` 'If Vespaluus is right I must be wrong , ' said the king . `` The Librarian was silent for a moment . Hasty speech has been the downfall of many ; ill-considered silence was the undoing of the luckless Court functionary . `` Forgetting the restraint due to his dignity , and the golden rule which imposes repose of mind and body after a heavy meal , the king rushed upon the keeper of the royal books and hit him repeatedly and promiscuously over the head with an ivory chessboard , a pewter wine-flagon , and a brass candlestick ; he knocked him violently and often against an iron torch sconce , and kicked him thrice round the banqueting chamber with rapid , energetic kicks . Finally , he dragged him down a long passage by the hair of his head and flung him out of a window into the courtyard below . '' `` Was he much hurt ? '' asked the Baroness . `` More hurt than surprised , '' said Clovis . You see , the king was notorious for his violent temper . However , this was the first time he had let himself go so unrestrainedly on the top of a heavy meal . The Librarian lingered for many days -- in fact , for all I know , he may have ultimately recovered , but Hkrikros died that same evening . Vespaluus had hardly finished getting the honey stains off his body before a hurried deputation came to put the coronation oil on his head . And what with the publicly-witnessed miracle and the accession of a Christian sovereign , it was not surprising that there was a general scramble of converts to the new religion . A hastily consecrated bishop was overworked with a rush of baptisms in the hastily improvised Cathedral of St. Odilo . And the boy-martyr-that-might-have-been was transposed in the popular imagination into a royal boy-saint , whose fame attracted throngs of curious and devout sightseers to the capital . Vespaluus , who was busily engaged in organizing the games and athletic contests that were to mark the commencement of his reign , had no time to give heed to the religious fervour which was effervescing round his personality ; the first indication he had of the existing state of affairs was when the Court Chamberlain ( a recent and very ardent addition to the Christian community ) brought for his approval the outlines of a projected ceremonial cutting-down of the idolatrous serpent-grove . `` 'Your Majesty will be graciously pleased to cut down the first tree with a specially consecrated axe , ' said the obsequious official . `` ' I 'll cut off your head first , with any axe that comes handy , ' said Vespaluus indignantly ; 'do you suppose that I 'm going to begin my reign by mortally affronting the sacred serpents ? It would be most unlucky . ' `` 'But your Majesty 's Christian principles ? ' exclaimed the bewildered Chamberlain . `` ' I never had any , ' said Vespaluus ; ' I used to pretend to be a Christian convert just to annoy Hkrikros . He used to fly into such delicious tempers . And it was rather fun being whipped and scolded and shut up in a tower all for nothing . But as to turning Christian in real earnest , like you people seem to do , I could n't think of such a thing . And the holy and esteemed serpents have always helped me when I 've prayed to them for success in my running and wrestling and hunting , and it was through their distinguished intercession that the bees were not able to hurt me with their stings . It would be black ingratitude , to turn against their worship at the very outset of my reign . I hate you for suggesting it . ' `` The Chamberlain wrung his hands despairingly . `` 'But , your Majesty , ' he wailed , 'the people are reverencing you as a saint , and the nobles are being Christianized in batches , and neighbouring potentates of that Faith are sending special envoys to welcome you as a brother . There is some talk of making you the patron saint of beehives , and a certain shade of honey-yellow has been christened Vespaluusian gold at the Emperor 's Court . You ca n't surely go back on all this . ' `` ' I do n't mind being reverenced and greeted and honoured , ' said Vespaluus ; ' I do n't even mind being sainted in moderation , as long as I 'm not expected to be saintly as well . But I wish you clearly and finally to understand that I will NOT give up the worship of the august and auspicious serpents . ' `` There was a world of unspoken bear-pit in the way he uttered those last words , and the mulberry-dark eyes flashed dangerously . `` ' A new reign , ' said the Chamberlain to himself , 'but the same old temper . ' `` Finally , as a State necessity , the matter of the religions was compromised . At stated intervals the king appeared before his subjects in the national cathedral in the character of St. Vespaluus , and the idolatrous grove was gradually pruned and lopped away till nothing remained of it . But the sacred and esteemed serpents were removed to a private shrubbery in the royal gardens , where Vespaluus the Pagan and certain members of his household devoutly and decently worshipped them . That possibly is the reason why the boy-king 's success in sports and hunting never deserted him to the end of his days , and that is also the reason why , in spite of the popular veneration for his sanctity , he never received official canonization . '' `` It has stopped raining , '' said the Baroness . THE WAY TO THE DAIRY The Baroness and Clovis sat in a much-frequented corner of the Park exchanging biographical confidences about the long succession of passers-by . `` Who are those depressed-looking young women who have just gone by ? '' asked the Baroness ; `` they have the air of people who have bowed to destiny and are not quite sure whether the salute will be returned . '' `` Those , '' said Clovis , `` are the Brimley Bomefields . I dare say you would look depressed if you had been through their experiences . '' `` I 'm always having depressing experiences ; '' said the Baroness , `` but I never give them outward expression . It 's as bad as looking one 's age . Tell me about the Brimley Bomefields . '' `` Well , '' said Clovis , `` the beginning of their tragedy was that they found an aunt . The aunt had been there all the time , but they had very nearly forgotten her existence until a distant relative refreshed their memory by remembering her very distinctly in his will ; it is wonderful what the force of example will accomplish . The aunt , who had been unobtrusively poor , became quite pleasantly rich , and the Brimley Bomefields grew suddenly concerned at the loneliness of her life and took her under their collective wings . She had as many wings around her at this time as one of those beast-things in Revelation . '' `` So far I do n't see any tragedy from the Brimley Bomefields ' point of view , '' said the Baroness . `` We have n't got to it yet , '' said Clovis . `` The aunt had been used to living very simply , and had seen next to nothing of what we should consider life , and her nieces did n't encourage her to do much in the way of making a splash with her money . Quite a good deal of it would come to them at her death , and she was a fairly old woman , but there was one circumstance which cast a shadow of gloom over the satisfaction they felt in the discovery and acquisition of this desirable aunt : she openly acknowledged that a comfortable slice of her little fortune would go to a nephew on the other side of her family . He was rather a deplorable thing in rotters , and quite hopelessly top-hole in the way of getting through money , but he had been more or less decent to the old lady in her unremembered days , and she would n't hear anything against him . At least , she would n't pay any attention to what she did hear , but her nieces took care that she should have to listen to a good deal in that line . It seemed such a pity , they said among themselves , that good money should fall into such worthless hands . They habitually spoke of their aunt 's money as 'good money , ' as though other people's aunts dabbled for the most part in spurious currency . `` Regularly after the Derby , St. Leger , and other notable racing events they indulged in audible speculations as to how much money Roger had squandered in unfortunate betting transactions . `` 'His travelling expenses must come to a big sum , ' said the eldest Brimley Bomefield one day ; 'they say he attends every race-meeting in England , besides others abroad . I should n't wonder if he went all the way to India to see the race for the Calcutta Sweepstake that one hears so much about . ' `` 'Travel enlarges the mind , my dear Christine , ' said her aunt . `` 'Yes , dear aunt , travel undertaken in the right spirit , ' agreed Christine ; 'but travel pursued merely as a means towards gambling and extravagant living is more likely to contract the purse than to enlarge the mind . However , as long as Roger enjoys himself , I suppose he does n't care how fast or unprofitably the money goes , or where he is to find more . It seems a pity , that 's all . ' `` The aunt by that time had begun to talk of something else , and it was doubtful if Christine 's moralizing had been even accorded a hearing . It was her remark , however -- the aunt 's remark , I mean -- about travel enlarging the mind , that gave the youngest Brimley Bomefield her great idea for the showing-up of Roger . `` 'If aunt could only be taken somewhere to see him gambling and throwing away money , ' she said , 'it would open her eyes to his character more effectually than anything we can say . ' `` 'My dear Veronique , ' said her sisters , 'we ca n't go following him to race-meetings . ' `` 'Certainly not to race-meetings , ' said Veronique , 'but we might go to some place where one can look on at gambling without taking part in it . ' `` 'Do you mean Monte Carlo ? ' they asked her , beginning to jump rather at the idea . `` 'Monte Carlo is a long way off , and has a dreadful reputation , ' said Veronique ; ' I should n't like to tell our friends that we were going to Monte Carlo . But I believe Roger usually goes to Dieppe about this time of year , and some quite respectable English people go there , and the journey would n't be expensive . If aunt could stand the Channel crossing the change of scene might do her a lot of good . ' `` And that was how the fateful idea came to the Brimley Bomefields . `` From the very first set-off disaster hung over the expedition , as they afterwards remembered . To begin with , all the Brimley Bomefields were extremely unwell during the crossing , while the aunt enjoyed the sea air and made friends with all manner of strange travelling companions . Then , although it was many years since she had been on the Continent , she had served a very practical apprenticeship there as a paid companion , and her knowledge of colloquial French beat theirs to a standstill . It became increasingly difficult to keep under their collective wings a person who knew what she wanted and was able to ask for it and to see that she got it . Also , as far as Roger was concerned , they drew Dieppe blank ; it turned out that he was staying at Pourville , a little watering-place a mile or two further west . The Brimley Bomefields discovered that Dieppe was too crowded and frivolous , and persuaded the old lady to migrate to the comparative seclusion of Pourville . `` 'You wo n't find it dull , you know , ' they assured her ; 'there is a little casino attached to the hotel , and you can watch the people dancing and throwing away their money at PETITS CHEVAUX . ' `` It was just before PETITS CHEVAUX had been supplanted by BOULE . `` Roger was not staying in the same hotel , but they knew that the casino would be certain of his patronage on most afternoons and evenings . `` On the first evening of their visit they wandered into the casino after a fairly early dinner , and hovered near the tables . Bertie van Tahn was staying there at the time , and he described the whole incident to me . The Brimley Bomefields kept a furtive watch on the doors as though they were expecting some one to turn up , and the aunt got more and more amused and interested watching the little horses whirl round and round the board . `` 'Do you know , poor little number eight has n't won for the last thirty-two times , ' she said to Christine ; ' I 've been keeping count . I shall really have to put five francs on him to encourage him . ' `` 'Come and watch the dancing , dear , ' said Christine nervously . It was scarcely a part of their strategy that Roger should come in and find the old lady backing her fancy at the PETITS CHEVAUX table . `` 'Just wait while I put five francs on number eight , ' said the aunt , and in another moment her money was lying on the table . The horses commenced to move round , it was a slow race this time , and number eight crept up at the finish like some crafty demon and placed his nose just a fraction in front of number three , who had seemed to be winning easily . Recourse had to be had to measurement , and the number eight was proclaimed the winner . The aunt picked up thirty-five francs . After that the Brimley Bomefields would have had to have used concerted force to get her away from the tables . When Roger appeared on the scene she was fifty-two francs to the good ; her nieces were hovering forlornly in the background , like chickens that have been hatched out by a duck and are despairingly watching their parent disporting herself in a dangerous and uncongenial element . The supper-party which Roger insisted on standing that night in honour of his aunt and the three Miss Brimley Bomefields was remarkable for the unrestrained gaiety of two of the participants and the funereal mirthlessness of the remaining guests . `` ' I do not think , ' Christine confided afterwards to a friend , who re-confided it to Bertie van Tahn , 'that I shall ever be able to touch PATÉ DE FOIE GRAS again . It would bring back memories of that awful evening . ' `` For the next two or three days the nieces made plans for returning to England or moving on to some other resort where there was no casino . The aunt was busy making a system for winning at PETITS CHEVAUX . Number eight , her first love , had been running rather unkindly for her , and a series of plunges on number five had turned out even worse . `` 'Do you know , I dropped over seven hundred francs at the tables this afternoon , ' she announced cheerfully at dinner on the fourth evening of their visit . `` 'Aunt ! Twenty-eight pounds ! And you were losing last night too . ' `` 'Oh , I shall get it all back , ' she said optimistically ; 'but not here . These silly little horses are no good . I shall go somewhere where one can play comfortably at roulette . You need n't look so shocked . I've always felt that , given the opportunity , I should be an inveterate gambler , and now you darlings have put the opportunity in my way . I must drink your very good healths . Waiter , a bottle of PONTET CANET . Ah , it 's number seven on the wine list ; I shall plunge on number seven to-night . It won four times running this afternoon when I was backing that silly number five . ' `` Number seven was not in a winning mood that evening . The Brimley Bomefields , tired of watching disaster from a distance , drew near to the table where their aunt was now an honoured habituée , and gazed mournfully at the successive victories of one and five and eight and four , which swept 'good money ' out of the purse of seven 's obstinate backer . The day 's losses totalled something very near two thousand francs . `` 'You incorrigible gamblers , ' said Roger chaffingly to them , when he found them at the tables . `` 'We are not gambling , ' said Christine freezingly ; 'we are looking on . ' `` ' I DO N'T think , ' said Roger knowingly ; 'of course you 're a syndicate and aunt is putting the stakes on for all of you . Anyone can tell by your looks when the wrong horse wins that you 've got a stake on . ' `` Aunt and nephew had supper alone that night , or at least they would have if Bertie had n't joined them ; all the Brimley Bomefields had headaches . `` The aunt carried them all off to Dieppe the next day and set cheerily about the task of winning back some of her losses . Her luck was variable ; in fact , she had some fair streaks of good fortune , just enough to keep her thoroughly amused with her new distraction ; but on the whole she was a loser . The Brimley Bomefields had a collective attack of nervous prostration on the day when she sold out a quantity of shares in Argentine rails . 'Nothing will ever bring that money back , ' they remarked lugubriously to one another . `` 'Veronique at last could bear it no longer , and went home ; you see , it had been her idea to bring the aunt on this disastrous expedition , and though the others did not cast the fact verbally in her face , there was a certain lurking reproach in their eyes which was harder to meet than actual upbraidings . The other two remained behind , forlornly mounting guard over their aunt until such time as the waning of the Dieppe season should at last turn her in the direction of home and safety . They made anxious calculations as to how little 'good money ' might , with reasonable luck , be squandered in the meantime . Here , however , their reckoning went far astray ; the close of the Dieppe season merely turned their aunt 's thoughts in search of some other convenient gambling resort . 'Show a cat the way to the dairy -- ' I forget how the proverb goes on , but it summed up the situation as far as the Brimley Bomefields ' aunt was concerned . She had been introduced to unexplored pleasures , and found them greatly to her liking , and she was in no hurry to forgo the fruits of her newly acquired knowledge . You see , for the first time in her life the old thing was thoroughly enjoying herself ; she was losing money , but she had plenty of fun and excitement over the process , and she had enough left to do very comfortably on . Indeed , she was only just learning to understand the art of doing oneself well . She was a popular hostess , and in return her fellow-gamblers were always ready to entertain her to dinners and suppers when their luck was in . Her nieces , who still remained in attendance on her , with the pathetic unwillingness of a crew to leave a foundering treasure ship which might yet be steered into port , found little pleasure in these Bohemian festivities ; to see 'good money' lavished on good living for the entertainment of a nondescript circle of acquaintances who were not likely to be in any way socially useful to them , did not attune them to a spirit of revelry . They contrived , whenever possible , to excuse themselves from participation in their aunt 's deplored gaieties ; the Brimley Bomefield headaches became famous . `` And one day the nieces came to the conclusion that , as they would have expressed it , 'no useful purpose would be served ' by their continued attendance on a relative who had so thoroughly emancipated herself from the sheltering protection of their wings . The aunt bore the announcement of their departure with a cheerfulness that was almost disconcerting . `` 'It 's time you went home and had those headaches seen to by a specialist , ' was her comment on the situation . `` The homeward journey of the Brimley Bomefields was a veritable retreat from Moscow , and what made it the more bitter was the fact that the Moscow , in this case , was not overwhelmed with fire and ashes , but merely extravagantly over-illuminated . `` From mutual friends and acquaintances they sometimes get glimpses of their prodigal relative , who has settled down into a confirmed gambling maniac , living on such salvage of income as obliging moneylenders have left at her disposal . `` So you need not be surprised , '' concluded Clovis , `` if they do wear a depressed look in public . '' `` Which is Veronique ? '' asked the Baroness . `` The most depressed-looking of the three , '' said Clovis . THE PEACE OFFERING '' I want you to help me in getting up a dramatic entertainment of some sort , '' said the Baroness to Clovis . `` You see , there 's been an election petition down here , and a member unseated and no end of bitterness and ill-feeling , and the County is socially divided against itself . I thought a play of some kind would be an excellent opportunity for bringing people together again , and giving them something to think of besides tiresome political squabbles . '' The Baroness was evidently ambitious of reproducing beneath her own roof the pacifying effects traditionally ascribed to the celebrated Reel of Tullochgorum . `` We might do something on the lines of Greek tragedy , '' said Clovis , after due reflection ; `` the Return of Agamemnon , for instance . '' The Baroness frowned . `` It sounds rather reminiscent of an election result , does n't it ? '' `` It was n't that sort of return , '' explained Clovis ; `` it was a home-coming . '' `` I thought you said it was a tragedy . '' `` Well , it was . He was killed in his bathroom , you know . '' `` Oh , now I know the story , of course . Do you want me to take the part of Charlotte Corday ? '' `` That 's a different story and a different century , '' said Clovis ; `` the dramatic unities forbid one to lay a scene in more than one century at a time . The killing in this case has to be done by Clytemnestra . '' `` Rather a pretty name . I 'll do that part . I suppose you want to be Aga -- whatever his name is ? '' `` Dear no . Agamemnon was the father of grown-up children , and probably wore a beard and looked prematurely aged . I shall be his charioteer or bath-attendant , or something decorative of that kind . We must do everything in the Sumurun manner , you know . '' `` I do n't know , '' said the Baroness ; `` at least , I should know better if you would explain exactly what you mean by the Sumurun manner . '' Clovis obliged : `` Weird music , and exotic skippings and flying leaps , and lots of drapery and undrapery . Particularly undrapery . '' `` I think I told you the County are coming . The County wo n't stand anything very Greek . '' `` You can get over any objection by calling it Hygiene , or limb-culture , or something of that sort . After all , every one exposes their insides to the public gaze and sympathy nowadays , so why not one 's outside ? '' `` My dear boy , I can ask the County to a Greek play , or to a costume play , but to a Greek-costume play , never . It does n't do to let the dramatic instinct carry one too far ; one must consider one's environment . When one lives among greyhounds one should avoid giving life-like imitations of a rabbit , unless one want 's one 's head snapped off . Remember , I 've got this place on a seven years ' lease . And then , '' continued the Baroness , `` as to skippings and flying leaps ; I must ask Emily Dushford to take a part . She 's a dear good thing , and will do anything she 's told , or try to ; but can you imagine her doing a flying leap under any circumstances ? '' `` She can be Cassandra , and she need only take flying leaps into the future , in a metaphorical sense . '' `` Cassandra ; rather a pretty name . What kind of character is she ? '' `` She was a sort of advance-agent for calamities . To know her was to know the worst . Fortunately for the gaiety of the age she lived in , no one took her very seriously . Still , it must have been fairly galling to have her turning up after every catastrophe with a conscious air of 'perhaps another time you 'll believe what I say . ' '' `` I should have wanted to kill her . '' `` As Clytemnestra I believe you gratify that very natural wish . '' `` Then it has a happy ending , in spite of it being a tragedy ? '' `` Well , hardly , '' said Clovis ; `` you see , the satisfaction of putting a violent end to Cassandra must have been considerably damped by the fact that she had foretold what was going to happen to her . She probably dies with an intensely irritating 'what-did-I-tell-you ' smile on her lips . By the way , of course all the killing will be done in the Sumurun manner . '' `` Please explain again , '' said the Baroness , taking out a notebook and pencil . `` Little and often , you know , instead of one sweeping blow . You see , you are at your own home , so there 's no need to hurry over the murdering as though it were some disagreeable but necessary duty . '' `` And what sort of end do I have ? I mean , what curtain do I get ? '' `` I suppose you rush into your lover 's arms . That is where one of the flying leaps will come in . '' The getting-up and rehearsing of the play seemed likely to cause , in a restricted area , nearly as much heart-burning and ill-feeling as the election petition . Clovis , as adapter and stage-manager , insisted , as far as he was able , on the charioteer being quite the most prominent character in the play , and his panther-skin tunic caused almost as much trouble and discussion as Clytemnestra 's spasmodic succession of lovers , who broke down on probation with alarming uniformity . When the cast was at length fixed beyond hope of reprieve matters went scarcely more smoothly . Clovis and the Baroness rather overdid the Sumurun manner , while the rest of the company could hardly be said to attempt it at all . As for Cassandra , who was expected to improvise her own prophecies , she appeared to be as incapable of taking flying leaps into futurity as of executing more than a severely plantigrade walk across the stage . `` Woe ! Trojans , woe to Troy ! '' was the most inspired remark she could produce after several hours of conscientious study of all the available authorities . `` It 's no earthly use foretelling the fall of Troy , '' expostulated Clovis , `` because Troy has fallen before the action of the play begins . And you must n't say too much about your own impending doom either , because that will give things away too much to the audience . '' After several minutes of painful brain-searching , Cassandra smiled reassuringly . `` I know . I 'll predict a long and happy reign for George the Fifth . '' `` My dear girl , '' protested Clovis , `` have you reflected that Cassandra specialized in foretelling calamities ? '' There was another prolonged pause and another triumphant issue . `` I know . I 'll foretell a most disastrous season for the foxhounds . '' `` On no account , '' entreated Clovis ; `` do remember that all Cassandra's predictions came true . The M.F.H . and the Hunt Secretary are both awfully superstitious , and they are both going to be present . '' Cassandra retreated hastily to her bedroom to bathe her eyes before appearing at tea . The Baroness and Clovis were by this time scarcely on speaking terms . Each sincerely wished their respective rôle to be the pivot round which the entire production should revolve , and each lost no opportunity for furthering the cause they had at heart . As fast as Clovis introduced some effective bit of business for the charioteer ( and he introduced a great many ) , the Baroness would remorselessly cut it out , or more often dovetail it into her own part , while Clovis retaliated in a similar fashion whenever possible . The climax came when Clytemnestra annexed some highly complimentary lines , which were to have been addressed to the charioteer by a bevy of admiring Greek damsels , and put them into the mouth of her lover . Clovis stood by in apparent unconcern while the words : '' Oh , lovely stripling , radiant as the dawn , '' were transposed into : '' Oh , Clytemnestra , radiant as the dawn , '' but there was a dangerous glitter in his eye that might have given the Baroness warning . He had composed the verse himself , inspired and thoroughly carried away by his subject ; he suffered , therefore , a double pang in beholding his tribute deflected from its destined object , and his words mutilated and twisted into what became an extravagant panegyric on the Baroness 's personal charms . It was from this moment that he became gentle and assiduous in his private coaching of Cassandra . The County , forgetting its dissensions , mustered in full strength to witness the much-talked-of production . The protective Providence that looks after little children and amateur theatricals made good its traditional promise that everything should be right on the night . The Baroness and Clovis seemed to have sunk their mutual differences , and between them dominated the scene to the partial eclipse of all the other characters , who , for the most part , seemed well content to remain in the shadow . Even Agamemnon , with ten years of strenuous life around Troy standing to his credit , appeared to be an unobtrusive personality compared with his flamboyant charioteer . But the moment came for Cassandra ( who had been excused from any very definite outpourings during rehearsals ) to support her rôle by delivering herself of a few well-chosen anticipations of pending misfortune . The musicians obliged with appropriately lugubrious wailings and thumpings , and the Baroness seized the opportunity to make a dash to the dressing-room to effect certain repairs in her make-up . Cassandra , nervous but resolute , came down to the footlights and , like one repeating a carefully learned lesson , flung her remarks straight at the audience : '' I see woe for this fair country if the brood of corrupt , self-seeking , unscrupulous , unprincipled politicians '' ( here she named one of the two rival parties in the State ) `` continue to infest and poison our local councils and undermine our Parliamentary representation ; if they continue to snatch votes by nefarious and discreditable means -- '' A humming as of a great hive of bewildered and affronted bees drowned her further remarks and wore down the droning of the musicians . The Baroness , who should have been greeted on her return to the stage with the pleasing invocation , `` Oh , Clytemnestra , radiant as the dawn , '' heard instead the imperious voice of Lady Thistledale ordering her carriage , and something like a storm of open discord going on at the back of the room . * * * * * The social divisions in the County healed themselves after their own fashion ; both parties found common ground in condemning the Baroness's outrageously bad taste and tactlessness . She has been fortunate in sub-letting for the greater part of her seven years ' lease . THE PEACE OF MOWSLE BARTON Crefton Lockyer sat at his ease , an ease alike of body and soul , in the little patch of ground , half-orchard and half-garden , that abutted on the farmyard at Mowsle Barton . After the stress and noise of long years of city life , the repose and peace of the hill-begirt homestead struck on his senses with an almost dramatic intensity . Time and space seemed to lose their meaning and their abruptness ; the minutes slid away into hours , and the meadows and fallows sloped away into middle distance , softly and imperceptibly . Wild weeds of the hedgerow straggled into the flower-garden , and wallflowers and garden bushes made counter-raids into farmyard and lane . Sleepy-looking hens and solemn preoccupied ducks were equally at home in yard , orchard , or roadway ; nothing seemed to belong definitely to anywhere ; even the gates were not necessarily to be found on their hinges . And over the whole scene brooded the sense of a peace that had almost a quality of magic in it . In the afternoon you felt that it had always been afternoon , and must always remain afternoon ; in the twilight you knew that it could never have been anything else but twilight . Crefton Lockyer sat at his ease in the rustic seat beneath an old medlar tree , and decided that here was the life-anchorage that his mind had so fondly pictured and that latterly his tired and jarred senses had so often pined for . He would make a permanent lodging-place among these simple friendly people , gradually increasing the modest comforts with which he would like to surround himself , but falling in as much as possible with their manner of living . As he slowly matured this resolution in his mind an elderly woman came hobbling with uncertain gait through the orchard . He recognized her as a member of the farm household , the mother or possibly the mother-in-law of Mrs. Spurfield , his present landlady , and hastily formulated some pleasant remark to make to her . She forestalled him . `` There 's a bit of writing chalked up on the door over yonder . What is it ? '' She spoke in a dull impersonal manner , as though the question had been on her lips for years and had best be got rid of . Her eyes , however , looked impatiently over Crefton 's head at the door of a small barn which formed the outpost of a straggling line of farm buildings . `` Martha Pillamon is an old witch '' was the announcement that met Crefton 's inquiring scrutiny , and he hesitated a moment before giving the statement wider publicity . For all he knew to the contrary , it might be Martha herself to whom he was speaking . It was possible that Mrs. Spurfield 's maiden name had been Pillamon . And the gaunt , withered old dame at his side might certainly fulfil local conditions as to the outward aspect of a witch . `` It 's something about some one called Martha Pillamon , '' he explained cautiously . `` What does it say ? '' `` It 's very disrespectful , '' said Crefton ; `` it says she 's a witch . Such things ought not to be written up . '' `` It 's true , every word of it , '' said his listener with considerable satisfaction , adding as a special descriptive note of her own , `` the old toad . '' And as she hobbled away through the farmyard she shrilled out in her cracked voice , `` Martha Pillamon is an old witch ! '' `` Did you hear what she said ? '' mumbled a weak , angry voice somewhere behind Crefton 's shoulder . Turning hastily , he beheld another old crone , thin and yellow and wrinkled , and evidently in a high state of displeasure . Obviously this was Martha Pillamon in person . The orchard seemed to be a favourite promenade for the aged women of the neighbourhood . `` 'T is lies , 't is sinful lies , '' the weak voice went on . `` 'T is Betsy Croot is the old witch . She an ' her daughter , the dirty rat . I 'll put a spell on 'em , the old nuisances . '' As she limped slowly away her eye caught the chalk inscription on the barn door . `` What 's written up there ? '' she demanded , wheeling round on Crefton . `` Vote for Soarker , '' he responded , with the craven boldness of the practised peacemaker . The old woman grunted , and her mutterings and her faded red shawl lost themselves gradually among the tree-trunks . Crefton rose presently and made his way towards the farm-house . Somehow a good deal of the peace seemed to have slipped out of the atmosphere . The cheery bustle of tea-time in the old farm kitchen , which Crefton had found so agreeable on previous afternoons , seemed to have soured to-day into a certain uneasy melancholy . There was a dull , dragging silence around the board , and the tea itself , when Crefton came to taste it , was a flat , lukewarm concoction that would have driven the spirit of revelry out of a carnival . `` It 's no use complaining of the tea , '' said Mrs. Spurfield hastily , as her guest stared with an air of polite inquiry at his cup . `` The kettle wo n't boil , that 's the truth of it . '' Crefton turned to the hearth , where an unusually fierce fire was banked up under a big black kettle , which sent a thin wreath of steam from its spout , but seemed otherwise to ignore the action of the roaring blaze beneath it . `` It 's been there more than an hour , an ' boil it wo n't , '' said Mrs. Spurfield , adding , by way of complete explanation , `` we 're bewitched . '' `` It 's Martha Pillamon as has done it , '' chimed in the old mother ; `` I'll be even with the old toad . I 'll put a spell on her . '' `` It must boil in time , '' protested Crefton , ignoring the suggestions of foul influences . `` Perhaps the coal is damp . '' `` It wo n't boil in time for supper , nor for breakfast to-morrow morning , not if you was to keep the fire a-going all night for it , '' said Mrs. Spurfield . And it did n't . The household subsisted on fried and baked dishes , and a neighbour obligingly brewed tea and sent it across in a moderately warm condition . `` I suppose you 'll be leaving us , now that things has turned up uncomfortable , '' Mrs. Spurfield observed at breakfast ; `` there are folks as deserts one as soon as trouble comes . '' Crefton hurriedly disclaimed any immediate change of plans ; he observed , however , to himself that the earlier heartiness of manner had in a large measure deserted the household . Suspicious looks , sulky silences , or sharp speeches had become the order of the day . As for the old mother , she sat about the kitchen or the garden all day , murmuring threats and spells against Martha Pillamon . There was something alike terrifying and piteous in the spectacle of these frail old morsels of humanity consecrating their last flickering energies to the task of making each other wretched . Hatred seemed to be the one faculty which had survived in undiminished vigour and intensity where all else was dropping into ordered and symmetrical decay . And the uncanny part of it was that some horrid unwholesome power seemed to be distilled from their spite and their cursings . No amount of sceptical explanation could remove the undoubted fact that neither kettle nor saucepan would come to boiling-point over the hottest fire . Crefton clung as long as possible to the theory of some defect in the coals , but a wood fire gave the same result , and when a small spirit-lamp kettle , which he ordered out by carrier , showed the same obstinate refusal to allow its contents to boil he felt that he had come suddenly into contact with some unguessed-at and very evil aspect of hidden forces . Miles away , down through an opening in the hills , he could catch glimpses of a road where motor-cars sometimes passed , and yet here , so little removed from the arteries of the latest civilization , was a bat-haunted old homestead , where something unmistakably like witchcraft seemed to hold a very practical sway . Passing out through the farm garden on his way to the lanes beyond , where he hoped to recapture the comfortable sense of peacefulness that was so lacking around house and hearth -- especially hearth -- Crefton came across the old mother , sitting mumbling to herself in the seat beneath the medlar tree . `` Let un sink as swims , let un sink as swims , '' she was , repeating over and over again , as a child repeats a half-learned lesson . And now and then she would break off into a shrill laugh , with a note of malice in it that was not pleasant to hear . Crefton was glad when he found himself out of earshot , in the quiet and seclusion of the deep overgrown lanes that seemed to lead away to nowhere ; one , narrower and deeper than the rest , attracted his footsteps , and he was almost annoyed when he found that it really did act as a miniature roadway to a human dwelling . A forlorn-looking cottage with a scrap of ill-tended cabbage garden and a few aged apple trees stood at an angle where a swift flowing stream widened out for a space into a decent sized pond before hurrying away again through the willows that had checked its course . Crefton leaned against a tree-trunk and looked across the swirling eddies of the pond at the humble little homestead opposite him ; the only sign of life came from a small procession of dingy-looking ducks that marched in single file down to the water's edge . There is always something rather taking in the way a duck changes itself in an instant from a slow , clumsy waddler of the earth to a graceful , buoyant swimmer of the waters , and Crefton waited with a certain arrested attention to watch the leader of the file launch itself on to the surface of the pond . He was aware at the same time of a curious warning instinct that something strange and unpleasant was about to happen . The duck flung itself confidently forward into the water , and rolled immediately under the surface . Its head appeared for a moment and went under again , leaving a train of bubbles in its wake , while wings and legs churned the water in a helpless swirl of flapping and kicking . The bird was obviously drowning . Crefton thought at first that it had caught itself in some weeds , or was being attacked from below by a pike or water-rat . But no blood floated to the surface , and the wildly bobbing body made the circuit of the pond current without hindrance from any entanglement . A second duck had by this time launched itself into the pond , and a second struggling body rolled and twisted under the surface . There was something peculiarly piteous in the sight of the gasping beaks that showed now and again above the water , as though in terrified protest at this treachery of a trusted and familiar element . Crefton gazed with something like horror as a third duck poised itself on the bank and splashed in , to share the fate of the other two . He felt almost relieved when the remainder of the flock , taking tardy alarm from the commotion of the slowly drowning bodies , drew themselves up with tense outstretched necks , and sidled away from the scene of danger , quacking a deep note of disquietude as they went . At the same moment Crefton became aware that he was not the only human witness of the scene ; a bent and withered old woman , whom he recognized at once as Martha Pillamon , of sinister reputation , had limped down the cottage path to the water 's edge , and was gazing fixedly at the gruesome whirligig of dying birds that went in horrible procession round the pool . Presently her voice rang out in a shrill note of quavering rage : '' 'T is Betsy Croot adone it , the old rat . I 'll put a spell on her , see if I do n't . '' Crefton slipped quietly away , uncertain whether or no the old woman had noticed his presence . Even before she had proclaimed the guiltiness of Betsy Croot , the latter 's muttered incantation `` Let un sink as swims '' had flashed uncomfortably across his mind . But it was the final threat of a retaliatory spell which crowded his mind with misgiving to the exclusion of all other thoughts or fancies . His reasoning powers could no longer afford to dismiss these old-wives ' threats as empty bickerings . The household at Mowsle Barton lay under the displeasure of a vindictive old woman who seemed able to materialize her personal spites in a very practical fashion , and there was no saying what form her revenge for three drowned ducks might not take . As a member of the household Crefton might find himself involved in some general and highly disagreeable visitation of Martha Pillamon 's wrath . Of course he knew that he was giving way to absurd fancies , but the behaviour of the spirit-lamp kettle and the subsequent scene at the pond had considerably unnerved him . And the vagueness of his alarm added to its terrors ; when once you have taken the Impossible into your calculations its possibilities become practically limitless . Crefton rose at his usual early hour the next morning , after one of the least restful nights he had spent at the farm . His sharpened senses quickly detected that subtle atmosphere of things-being-not-altogether-well that hangs over a stricken household . The cows had been milked , but they stood huddled about in the yard , waiting impatiently to be driven out afield , and the poultry kept up an importunate querulous reminder of deferred feeding-time ; the yard pump , which usually made discordant music at frequent intervals during the early morning , was to-day ominously silent . In the house itself there was a coming and going of scuttering footsteps , a rushing and dying away of hurried voices , and long , uneasy stillnesses . Crefton finished his dressing and made his way to the head of a narrow staircase . He could hear a dull , complaining voice , a voice into which an awed hush had crept , and recognized the speaker as Mrs. Spurfield . `` He 'll go away , for sure , '' the voice was saying ; `` there are those as runs away from one as soon as real misfortune shows itself . '' Crefton felt that he probably was one of `` those , '' and that there were moments when it was advisable to be true to type . He crept back to his room , collected and packed his few belongings , placed the money due for his lodgings on a table , and made his way out by a back door into the yard . A mob of poultry surged expectantly towards him ; shaking off their interested attentions he hurried along under cover of cowstall , piggery , and hayricks till he reached the lane at the back of the farm . A few minutes ' walk , which only the burden of his portmanteaux restrained from developing into an undisguised run , brought him to a main road , where the early carrier soon overtook him and sped him onward to the neighbouring town . At a bend of the road he caught a last glimpse of the farm ; the old gabled roofs and thatched barns , the straggling orchard , and the medlar tree , with its wooden seat , stood out with an almost spectral clearness in the early morning light , and over it all brooded that air of magic possession which Crefton had once mistaken for peace . The bustle and roar of Paddington Station smote on his ears with a welcome protective greeting . `` Very bad for our nerves , all this rush and hurry , '' said a fellow-traveller ; `` give me the peace and quiet of the country . '' Crefton mentally surrendered his share of the desired commodity . A crowded , brilliantly over-lighted music-hall , where an exuberant rendering of `` 1812 '' was being given by a strenuous orchestra , came nearest to his ideal of a nerve sedative . THE TALKING-OUT OF TARRINGTON '' Heavens ! '' exclaimed the aunt of Clovis , `` here 's some one I know bearing down on us . I ca n't remember his name , but he lunched with us once in Town . Tarrington -- yes , that 's it . He 's heard of the picnic I 'm giving for the Princess , and he 'll cling to me like a lifebelt till I give him an invitation ; then he 'll ask if he may bring all his wives and mothers and sisters with him . That 's the worst of these small watering-places ; one ca n't escape from anybody . '' `` I 'll fight a rearguard action for you if you like to do a bolt now , '' volunteered Clovis ; `` you 've a clear ten yards start if you do n't lose time . '' The aunt of Clovis responded gamely to the suggestion , and churned away like a Nile steamer , with a long brown ripple of Pekingese spaniel trailing in her wake . `` Pretend you do n't know him , '' was her parting advice , tinged with the reckless courage of the non-combatant . The next moment the overtures of an affably disposed gentleman were being received by Clovis with a `` silent-upon-a-peak-in-Darien '' stare which denoted an absence of all previous acquaintance with the object scrutinized . `` I expect you do n't know me with my moustache , '' said the new-comer ; '' I 've only grown it during the last two months . '' `` On the contrary , '' said Clovis , `` the moustache is the only thing about you that seemed familiar to me . I felt certain that I had met it somewhere before . '' `` My name is Tarrington , '' resumed the candidate for recognition . `` A very useful kind of name , '' said Clovis ; `` with a name of that sort no one would blame you if you did nothing in particular heroic or remarkable , would they ? And yet if you were to raise a troop of light horse in a moment of national emergency , 'Tarrington 's Light Horse' would sound quite appropriate and pulse-quickening ; whereas if you were called Spoopin , for instance , the thing would be out of the question . No one , even in a moment of national emergency , could possibly belong to Spoopin 's Horse . '' The new-comer smiled weakly , as one who is not to be put off by mere flippancy , and began again with patient persistence : '' I think you ought to remember my name -- '' '' I shall , '' said Clovis , with an air of immense sincerity . `` My aunt was asking me only this morning to suggest names for four young owls she's just had sent her as pets . I shall call them all Tarrington ; then if one or two of them die or fly away , or leave us in any of the ways that pet owls are prone to , there will be always one or two left to carry on your name . And my aunt wo n't LET me forget it ; she will always be asking 'Have the Tarringtons had their mice ? ' and questions of that sort . She says if you keep wild creatures in captivity you ought to see after their wants , and of course she 's quite right there . '' `` I met you at luncheon at your aunt 's house once -- '' broke in Mr. Tarrington , pale but still resolute . `` My aunt never lunches , '' said Clovis ; `` she belongs to the National Anti-Luncheon League , which is doing quite a lot of good work in a quiet , unobtrusive way . A subscription of half a crown per quarter entitles you to go without ninety-two luncheons . '' `` This must be something new , '' exclaimed Tarrington . `` It 's the same aunt that I 've always had , '' said Clovis coldly . `` I perfectly well remember meeting you at a luncheon-party given by your aunt , '' persisted Tarrington , who was beginning to flush an unhealthy shade of mottled pink . `` What was there for lunch ? '' asked Clovis . `` Oh , well , I do n't remember that -- '' '' How nice of you to remember my aunt when you can no longer recall the names of the things you ate . Now my memory works quite differently . I can remember a menu long after I 've forgotten the hostess that accompanied it . When I was seven years old I recollect being given a peach at a garden-party by some Duchess or other ; I ca n't remember a thing about her , except that I imagine our acquaintance must have been of the slightest , as she called me a 'nice little boy , ' but I have unfading memories of that peach . It was one of those exuberant peaches that meet you halfway , so to speak , and are all over you in a moment . It was a beautiful unspoiled product of a hothouse , and yet it managed quite successfully to give itself the airs of a compote . You had to bite it and imbibe it at the same time . To me there has always been something charming and mystic in the thought of that delicate velvet globe of fruit , slowly ripening and warming to perfection through the long summer days and perfumed nights , and then coming suddenly athwart my life in the supreme moment of its existence . I can never forget it , even if I wished to . And when I had devoured all that was edible of it , there still remained the stone , which a heedless , thoughtless child would doubtless have thrown away ; I put it down the neck of a young friend who was wearing a very DÉCOLLETÉ sailor suit . I told him it was a scorpion , and from the way he wriggled and screamed he evidently believed it , though where the silly kid imagined I could procure a live scorpion at a garden-party I do n't know . Altogether , that peach is for me an unfading and happy memory -- '' The defeated Tarrington had by this time retreated out of ear-shot , comforting himself as best he might with the reflection that a picnic which included the presence of Clovis might prove a doubtfully agreeable experience . `` I shall certainly go in for a Parliamentary career , '' said Clovis to himself as he turned complacently to rejoin his aunt . `` As a talker-out of inconvenient bills I should be invaluable . '' THE HOUNDS OF FATE In the fading light of a close dull autumn afternoon Martin Stoner plodded his way along muddy lanes and rut-seamed cart tracks that led he knew not exactly whither . Somewhere in front of him , he fancied , lay the sea , and towards the sea his footsteps seemed persistently turning ; why he was struggling wearily forward to that goal he could scarcely have explained , unless he was possessed by the same instinct that turns a hard-pressed stag cliffward in its last extremity . In his case the hounds of Fate were certainly pressing him with unrelenting insistence ; hunger , fatigue , and despairing hopelessness had numbed his brain , and he could scarcely summon sufficient energy to wonder what underlying impulse was driving him onward . Stoner was one of those unfortunate individuals who seem to have tried everything ; a natural slothfulness and improvidence had always intervened to blight any chance of even moderate success , and now he was at the end of his tether , and there was nothing more to try . Desperation had not awakened in him any dormant reserve of energy ; on the contrary , a mental torpor grew up round the crisis of his fortunes . With the clothes he stood up in , a halfpenny in his pocket , and no single friend or acquaintance to turn to , with no prospect either of a bed for the night or a meal for the morrow , Martin Stoner trudged stolidly forward , between moist hedgerows and beneath dripping trees , his mind almost a blank , except that he was subconsciously aware that somewhere in front of him lay the sea . Another consciousness obtruded itself now and then -- the knowledge that he was miserably hungry . Presently he came to a halt by an open gateway that led into a spacious and rather neglected farm-garden ; there was little sign of life about , and the farm-house at the further end of the garden looked chill and inhospitable . A drizzling rain , however , was setting in , and Stoner thought that here perhaps he might obtain a few minutes ' shelter and buy a glass of milk with his last remaining coin . He turned slowly and wearily into the garden and followed a narrow , flagged path up to a side door . Before he had time to knock the door opened and a bent , withered-looking old man stood aside in the doorway as though to let him pass in . `` Could I come in out of the rain ? '' Stoner began , but the old man interrupted him . `` Come in , Master Tom . I knew you would come back one of these days . '' Stoner lurched across the threshold and stood staring uncomprehendingly at the other . `` Sit down while I put you out a bit of supper , '' said the old man with quavering eagerness . Stoner 's legs gave way from very weariness , and he sank inertly into the arm-chair that had been pushed up to him . In another minute he was devouring the cold meat , cheese , and bread , that had been placed on the table at his side . `` You 'm little changed these four years , '' went on the old man , in a voice that sounded to Stoner as something in a dream , far away and inconsequent ; `` but you 'll find us a deal changed , you will . There 's no one about the place same as when you left ; nought but me and your old Aunt . I 'll go and tell her that you 'm come ; she wo n't be seeing you , but she 'll let you stay right enough . She always did say if you was to come back you should stay , but she 'd never set eyes on you or speak to you again . '' The old man placed a mug of beer on the table in front of Stoner and then hobbled away down a long passage . The drizzle of rain had changed to a furious lashing downpour , which beat violently against door and windows . The wanderer thought with a shudder of what the sea-shore must look like under this drenching rainfall , with night beating down on all sides . He finished the food and beer and sat numbly waiting for the return of his strange host . As the minutes ticked by on the grandfather clock in the corner a new hope began to flicker and grow in the young man 's mind ; it was merely the expansion of his former craving for food and a few minutes ' rest into a longing to find a night's shelter under this seemingly hospitable roof . A clattering of footsteps down the passage heralded the old farm servant 's return . `` The old missus wo n't see you , Master Tom , but she says you are to stay . 'T is right enough , seeing the farm will be yours when she be put under earth . I 've had a fire lit in your room , Master Tom , and the maids has put fresh sheets on to the bed . You 'll find nought changed up there . Maybe you 'm tired and would like to go there now . '' Without a word Martin Stoner rose heavily to his feet and followed his ministering angel along a passage , up a short creaking stair , along another passage , and into a large room lit with a cheerfully blazing fire . There was but little furniture , plain , old-fashioned , and good of its kind ; a stuffed squirrel in a case and a wall-calendar of four years ago were about the only symptoms of decoration . But Stoner had eyes for little else than the bed , and could scarce wait to tear his clothes off him before rolling in a luxury of weariness into its comfortable depths . The hounds of Fate seemed to have checked for a brief moment . In the cold light of morning Stoner laughed mirthlessly as he slowly realized the position in which he found himself . Perhaps he might snatch a bit of breakfast on the strength of his likeness to this other missing ne'er-do-well , and get safely away before anyone discovered the fraud that had been thrust on him . In the room downstairs he found the bent old man ready with a dish of bacon and fried eggs for `` Master Tom 's '' breakfast , while a hard-faced elderly maid brought in a teapot and poured him out a cup of tea . As he sat at the table a small spaniel came up and made friendly advances . `` 'T is old Bowker 's pup , '' explained the old man , whom the hard-faced maid had addressed as George . `` She was main fond of you ; never seemed the same after you went away to Australee . She died 'bout a year agone . 'T is her pup . '' Stoner found it difficult to regret her decease ; as a witness for identification she would have left something to be desired . `` You 'll go for a ride , Master Tom ? '' was the next startling proposition that came from the old man . `` We 've a nice little roan cob that goes well in saddle . Old Biddy is getting a bit up in years , though 'er goes well still , but I 'll have the little roan saddled and brought round to door . '' `` I 've got no riding things , '' stammered the castaway , almost laughing as he looked down at his one suit of well-worn clothes . `` Master Tom , '' said the old man earnestly , almost with an offended air , '' all your things is just as you left them . A bit of airing before the fire an ' they 'll be all right . 'Twill be a bit of a distraction like , a little riding and wild-fowling now and agen . You 'll find the folk around here has hard and bitter minds towards you . They hasn't forgotten nor forgiven . No one 'll come nigh you , so you 'd best get what distraction you can with horse and dog . They 'm good company , too . '' Old George hobbled away to give his orders , and Stoner , feeling more than ever like one in a dream , went upstairs to inspect `` Master Tom 's '' wardrobe . A ride was one of the pleasures dearest to his heart , and there was some protection against immediate discovery of his imposture in the thought that none of Tom 's aforetime companions were likely to favour him with a close inspection . As the interloper thrust himself into some tolerably well-fitting riding cords he wondered vaguely what manner of misdeed the genuine Tom had committed to set the whole countryside against him . The thud of quick , eager hoofs on damp earth cut short his speculations . The roan cob had been brought up to the side door . `` Talk of beggars on horseback , '' thought Stoner to himself , as he trotted rapidly along the muddy lanes where he had tramped yesterday as a down-at-heel outcast ; and then he flung reflection indolently aside and gave himself up to the pleasure of a smart canter along the turf-grown side of a level stretch of road . At an open gateway he checked his pace to allow two carts to turn into a field . The lads driving the carts found time to give him a prolonged stare , and as he passed on he heard an excited voice call out , `` 'T is Tom Prike ! I knowed him at once ; showing hisself here agen , is he ? '' Evidently the likeness which had imposed at close quarters on a doddering old man was good enough to mislead younger eyes at a short distance . In the course of his ride he met with ample evidence to confirm the statement that local folk had neither forgotten nor forgiven the bygone crime which had come to him as a legacy from the absent Tom . Scowling looks , mutterings , and nudgings greeted him whenever he chanced upon human beings ; `` Bowker 's pup , '' trotting placidly by his side , seemed the one element of friendliness in a hostile world . As he dismounted at the side door he caught a fleeting glimpse of a gaunt , elderly woman peering at him from behind the curtain of an upper window . Evidently this was his aunt by adoption . Over the ample midday meal that stood in readiness for him Stoner was able to review the possibilities of his extraordinary situation . The real Tom , after four years of absence , might suddenly turn up at the farm , or a letter might come from him at any moment . Again , in the character of heir to the farm , the false Tom might be called on to sign documents , which would be an embarrassing predicament . Or a relative might arrive who would not imitate the aunt 's attitude of aloofness . All these things would mean ignominious exposure . On the other hand , the alternative was the open sky and the muddy lanes that led down to the sea . The farm offered him , at any rate , a temporary refuge from destitution ; farming was one of the many things he had `` tried , '' and he would be able to do a certain amount of work in return for the hospitality to which he was so little entitled . `` Will you have cold pork for your supper , '' asked the hard-faced maid , as she cleared the table , `` or will you have it hotted up ? '' `` Hot , with onions , '' said Stoner . It was the only time in his life that he had made a rapid decision . And as he gave the order he knew that he meant to stay . Stoner kept rigidly to those portions of the house which seemed to have been allotted to him by a tacit treaty of delimitation . When he took part in the farm-work it was as one who worked under orders and never initiated them . Old George , the roan cob , and Bowker 's pup were his sole companions in a world that was otherwise frostily silent and hostile . Of the mistress of the farm he saw nothing . Once , when he knew she had gone forth to church , he made a furtive visit to the farm parlour in an endeavour to glean some fragmentary knowledge of the young man whose place he had usurped , and whose ill-repute he had fastened on himself . There were many photographs hung on the walls , or stuck in prim frames , but the likeness he sought for was not among them . At last , in an album thrust out of sight , he came across what he wanted . There was a whole series , labelled `` Tom , '' a podgy child of three , in a fantastic frock , an awkward boy of about twelve , holding a cricket bat as though he loathed it , a rather good-looking youth of eighteen with very smooth , evenly parted hair , and , finally , a young man with a somewhat surly dare-devil expression . At this last portrait Stoner looked with particular interest ; the likeness to himself was unmistakable . From the lips of old George , who was garrulous enough on most subjects , he tried again and again to learn something of the nature of the offence which shut him off as a creature to be shunned and hated by his fellow-men . `` What do the folk around here say about me ? '' he asked one day as they were walking home from an outlying field . The old man shook his head . `` They be bitter agen you , mortal bitter . Aye , 't is a sad business , a sad business . '' And never could he be got to say anything more enlightening . On a clear frosty evening , a few days before the festival of Christmas , Stoner stood in a corner of the orchard which commanded a wide view of the countryside . Here and there he could see the twinkling dots of lamp or candle glow which told of human homes where the goodwill and jollity of the season held their sway . Behind him lay the grim , silent farm-house , where no one ever laughed , where even a quarrel would have seemed cheerful . As he turned to look at the long grey front of the gloom-shadowed building , a door opened and old George came hurriedly forth . Stoner heard his adopted name called in a tone of strained anxiety . Instantly he knew that something untoward had happened , and with a quick revulsion of outlook his sanctuary became in his eyes a place of peace and contentment , from which he dreaded to be driven . `` Master Tom , '' said the old man in a hoarse whisper , `` you must slip away quiet from here for a few days . Michael Ley is back in the village , an ' he swears to shoot you if he can come across you . He 'll do it , too , there 's murder in the look of him . Get away under cover of night , 't is only for a week or so , he wo n't be here longer . '' `` But where am I to go ? '' stammered Stoner , who had caught the infection of the old man 's obvious terror . `` Go right away along the coast to Punchford and keep hid there . When Michael 's safe gone I 'll ride the roan over to the Green Dragon at Punchford ; when you see the cob stabled at the Green Dragon 't is a sign you may come back agen . '' `` But -- '' began Stoner hesitatingly . `` 'T is all right for money , '' said the other ; `` the old Missus agrees you 'd best do as I say , and she 's given me this . '' The old man produced three sovereigns and some odd silver . Stoner felt more of a cheat than ever as he stole away that night from the back gate of the farm with the old woman 's money in his pocket . Old George and Bowker 's pup stood watching him a silent farewell from the yard . He could scarcely fancy that he would ever come back , and he felt a throb of compunction for those two humble friends who would wait wistfully for his return . Some day perhaps the real Tom would come back , and there would be wild wonderment among those simple farm folks as to the identity of the shadowy guest they had harboured under their roof . For his own fate he felt no immediate anxiety ; three pounds goes but little way in the world when there is nothing behind it , but to a man who has counted his exchequer in pennies it seems a good starting-point . Fortune had done him a whimsically kind turn when last he trod these lanes as a hopeless adventurer , and there might yet be a chance of his finding some work and making a fresh start ; as he got further from the farm his spirits rose higher . There was a sense of relief in regaining once more his lost identity and ceasing to be the uneasy ghost of another . He scarcely bothered to speculate about the implacable enemy who had dropped from nowhere into his life ; since that life was now behind him one unreal item the more made little difference . For the first time for many months he began to hum a careless lighthearted refrain . Then there stepped out from the shadow of an overhanging oak tree a man with a gun . There was no need to wonder who he might be ; the moonlight falling on his white set face revealed a glare of human hate such as Stoner in the ups and downs of his wanderings had never seen before . He sprang aside in a wild effort to break through the hedge that bordered the lane , but the tough branches held him fast . The hounds of Fate had waited for him in those narrow lanes , and this time they were not to be denied . THE RECESSIONAL Clovis sat in the hottest zone but two of a Turkish bath , alternately inert in statuesque contemplation and rapidly manoeuvring a fountain-pen over the pages of a note-book . `` Do n't interrupt me with your childish prattle , '' he observed to Bertie van Tahn , who had slung himself languidly into a neighbouring chair and looked conversationally inclined ; `` I 'm writing deathless verse . '' Bertie looked interested . `` I say , what a boon you would be to portrait painters if you really got to be notorious as a poetry writer . If they could n't get your likeness hung in the Academy as 'Clovis Sangrail , Esq. , at work on his latest poem , ' they could slip you in as a Study of the Nude or Orpheus descending into Jermyn Street . They always complain that modern dress handicaps them , whereas a towel and a fountain-pen -- '' '' It was Mrs. Packletide 's suggestion that I should write this thing , '' said Clovis , ignoring the bypaths to fame that Bertie van Tahn was pointing out to him . `` You see , Loona Bimberton had a Coronation Ode accepted by the NEW INFANCY , a paper that has been started with the idea of making the NEW AGE seem elderly and hidebound . 'So clever of you , dear Loona , ' the Packletide remarked when she had read it ; 'of course , anyone could write a Coronation Ode , but no one else would have thought of doing it . ' Loona protested that these things were extremely difficult to do , and gave us to understand that they were more or less the province of a gifted few . Now the Packletide has been rather decent to me in many ways , a sort of financial ambulance , you know , that carries you off the field when you 're hard hit , which is a frequent occurrence with me , and I 've no use whatever for Loona Bimberton , so I chipped in and said I could turn out that sort of stuff by the square yard if I gave my mind to it . Loona said I could n't , and we got bets on , and between you and me I think the money 's fairly safe . Of course , one of the conditions of the wager is that the thing has to be published in something or other , local newspapers barred ; but Mrs. Packletide has endeared herself by many little acts of thoughtfulness to the editor of the SMOKY CHIMNEY , so if I can hammer out anything at all approaching the level of the usual Ode output we ought to be all right . So far I 'm getting along so comfortably that I begin to be afraid that I must be one of the gifted few . '' `` It 's rather late in the day for a Coronation Ode , is n't it ? '' said Bertie . `` Of course , '' said Clovis ; `` this is going to be a Durbar Recessional , the sort of thing that you can keep by you for all time if you want to . '' `` Now I understand your choice of a place to write it in , '' said Bertie van Tahn , with the air of one who has suddenly unravelled a hitherto obscure problem ; `` you want to get the local temperature . '' `` I came here to get freedom from the inane interruptions of the mentally deficient , '' said Clovis , `` but it seems I asked too much of fate . '' Bertie van Tahn prepared to use his towel as a weapon of precision , but reflecting that he had a good deal of unprotected coast-line himself , and that Clovis was equipped with a fountain-pen as well as a towel , he relapsed pacifically into the depths of his chair . `` May one hear extracts from the immortal work ? '' he asked . `` I promise that nothing that I hear now shall prejudice me against borrowing a copy of the SMOKY CHIMNEY at the right moment . '' `` It 's rather like casting pearls into a trough , '' remarked Clovis pleasantly , `` but I do n't mind reading you bits of it . It begins with a general dispersal of the Durbar participants : 'Back to their homes in Himalayan heights The stale pale elephants of Cutch Behar Roll like great galleons on a tideless sea -- ' '' '' I do n't believe Cutch Behar is anywhere near the Himalayan region , '' interrupted Bertie . `` You ought to have an atlas on hand when you do this sort of thing ; and why stale and pale ? '' `` After the late hours and the excitement , of course , '' said Clovis ; `` and I said their HOMES were in the Himalayas . You can have Himalayan elephants in Cutch Behar , I suppose , just as you have Irish-bred horses running at Ascot . '' `` You said they were going back to the Himalayas , '' objected Bertie . `` Well , they would naturally be sent home to recuperate . It 's the usual thing out there to turn elephants loose in the hills , just as we put horses out to grass in this country . '' Clovis could at least flatter himself that he had infused some of the reckless splendour of the East into his mendacity . `` Is it all going to be in blank verse ? '' asked the critic . `` Of course not ; 'Durbar ' comes at the end of the fourth line . '' `` That seems so cowardly ; however , it explains why you pitched on Cutch Behar . '' `` There is more connection between geographical place-names and poetical inspiration than is generally recognized ; one of the chief reasons why there are so few really great poems about Russia in our language is that you ca n't possibly get a rhyme to names like Smolensk and Tobolsk and Minsk . '' Clovis spoke with the authority of one who has tried . `` Of course , you could rhyme Omsk with Tomsk , '' he continued ; `` in fact , they seem to be there for that purpose , but the public would n't stand that sort of thing indefinitely . '' `` The public will stand a good deal , '' said Bertie malevolently , `` and so small a proportion of it knows Russian that you could always have an explanatory footnote asserting that the last three letters in Smolensk are not pronounced . It 's quite as believable as your statement about putting elephants out to grass in the Himalayan range . '' `` I 've got rather a nice bit , '' resumed Clovis with unruffled serenity , '' giving an evening scene on the outskirts of a jungle village : 'Where the coiled cobra in the gloaming gloats , And prowling panthers stalk the wary goats . ' '' `` There is practically no gloaming in tropical countries , '' said Bertie indulgently ; `` but I like the masterly reticence with which you treat the cobra 's motive for gloating . The unknown is proverbially the uncanny . I can picture nervous readers of the SMOKY CHIMNEY keeping the light turned on in their bedrooms all night out of sheer sickening uncertainty as to WHAT the cobra might have been gloating about . '' `` Cobras gloat naturally , '' said Clovis , `` just as wolves are always ravening from mere force of habit , even after they 've hopelessly overeaten themselves . I 've got a fine bit of colour painting later on , '' he added , `` where I describe the dawn coming up over the Brahma-putra river : 'The amber dawn-drenched East with sun-shafts kissed , Stained sanguine apricot and amethyst , O'er the washed emerald of the mango groves Hangs in a mist of opalescent mauves , While painted parrot-flights impinge the haze With scarlet , chalcedon and chrysoprase . ' '' `` I 've never seen the dawn come up over the Brahma-putra river , '' said Bertie , `` so I ca n't say if it 's a good description of the event , but it sounds more like an account of an extensive jewel robbery . Anyhow , the parrots give a good useful touch of local colour . I suppose you've introduced some tigers into the scenery ? An Indian landscape would have rather a bare , unfinished look without a tiger or two in the middle distance . '' `` I 've got a hen-tiger somewhere in the poem , '' said Clovis , hunting through his notes . `` Here she is : 'The tawny tigress 'mid the tangled teak Drags to her purring cubs ' enraptured ears The harsh death-rattle in the pea-fowl 's beak , A jungle lullaby of blood and tears . ' '' Bertie van Tahn rose hurriedly from his recumbent position and made for the glass door leading into the next compartment . `` I think your idea of home life in the jungle is perfectly horrid , '' he said . `` The cobra was sinister enough , but the improvised rattle in the tiger-nursery is the limit . If you 're going to make me turn hot and cold all over I may as well go into the steam room at once . '' `` Just listen to this line , '' said Clovis ; `` it would make the reputation of any ordinary poet : 'and overhead The pendulum-patient Punkah , parent of stillborn breeze . ' '' `` Most of your readers will think 'punkah ' is a kind of iced drink or half-time at polo , '' said Bertie , and disappeared into the steam . * * * * * The SMOKY CHIMNEY duly published the `` Recessional , '' but it proved to be its swan song , for the paper never attained to another issue . Loona Bimberton gave up her intention of attending the Durbar and went into a nursing-home on the Sussex Downs . Nervous breakdown after a particularly strenuous season was the usually accepted explanation , but there are three or four people who know that she never really recovered from the dawn breaking over the Brahma-putra river . A MATTER OF SENTIMENT It was the eve of the great race , and scarcely a member of Lady Susan's house-party had as yet a single bet on . It was one of those unsatisfactory years when one horse held a commanding market position , not by reason of any general belief in its crushing superiority , but because it was extremely difficult to pitch on any other candidate to whom to pin ones faith . Peradventure II was the favourite , not in the sense of being a popular fancy , but by virtue of a lack of confidence in any one of his rather undistinguished rivals . The brains of clubland were much exercised in seeking out possible merit where none was very obvious to the naked intelligence , and the house-party at Lady Susan 's was possessed by the same uncertainty and irresolution that infected wider circles . `` It is just the time for bringing off a good coup , '' said Bertie van Tahn . `` Undoubtedly . But with what ? '' demanded Clovis for the twentieth time . The women of the party were just as keenly interested in the matter , and just as helplessly perplexed ; even the mother of Clovis , who usually got good racing information from her dressmaker , confessed herself fancy free on this occasion . Colonel Drake , who was professor of military history at a minor cramming establishment , was the only person who had a definite selection for the event , but as his choice varied every three hours he was worse than useless as an inspired guide . The crowning difficulty of the problem was that it could only be fitfully and furtively discussed . Lady Susan disapproved of racing . She disapproved of many things ; some people went as far as to say that she disapproved of most things . Disapproval was to her what neuralgia and fancy needlework are to many other women . She disapproved of early morning tea and auction bridge , of ski-ing and the two-step , of the Russian ballet and the Chelsea Arts Club ball , of the French policy in Morocco and the British policy everywhere . It was not that she was particularly strict or narrow in her views of life , but she had been the eldest sister of a large family of self-indulgent children , and her particular form of indulgence had consisted in openly disapproving of the foibles of the others . Unfortunately the hobby had grown up with her . As she was rich , influential , and very , very kind , most people were content to count their early tea as well lost on her behalf . Still , the necessity for hurriedly dropping the discussion of an enthralling topic , and suppressing all mention of it during her presence on the scene , was an affliction at a moment like the present , when time was slipping away and indecision was the prevailing note . After a lunch-time of rather strangled and uneasy conversation , Clovis managed to get most of the party together at the further end of the kitchen gardens , on the pretext of admiring the Himalayan pheasants . He had made an important discovery . Motkin , the butler , who ( as Clovis expressed it ) had grown prematurely grey in Lady Susan 's service , added to his other excellent qualities an intelligent interest in matters connected with the Turf . On the subject of the forthcoming race he was not illuminating , except in so far that he shared the prevailing unwillingness to see a winner in Peradventure II . But where he outshone all the members of the house-party was in the fact that he had a second cousin who was head stable-lad at a neighbouring racing establishment , and usually gifted with much inside information as to private form and possibilities . Only the fact of her ladyship having taken it into her head to invite a house-party for the last week of May had prevented Mr. Motkin from paying a visit of consultation to his relative with respect to the big race ; there was still time to cycle over if he could get leave of absence for the afternoon on some specious excuse . `` Let 's jolly well hope he does , '' said Bertie van Tahn ; `` under the circumstances a second cousin is almost as useful as second sight . '' `` That stable ought to know something , if knowledge is to be found anywhere , '' said Mrs. Packletide hopefully . `` I expect you 'll find he 'll echo my fancy for Motorboat , '' said Colonel Drake . At this moment the subject had to be hastily dropped . Lady Susan bore down upon them , leaning on the arm of Clovis 's mother , to whom she was confiding the fact that she disapproved of the craze for Pekingese spaniels . It was the third thing she had found time to disapprove of since lunch , without counting her silent and permanent disapproval of the way Clovis 's mother did her hair . `` We have been admiring the Himalayan pheasants , '' said Mrs. Packletide suavely . `` They went off to a bird-show at Nottingham early this morning , '' said Lady Susan , with the air of one who disapproves of hasty and ill-considered lying . `` Their house , I mean ; such perfect roosting arrangements , and all so clean , '' resumed Mrs. Packletide , with an increased glow of enthusiasm . The odious Bertie van Tahn was murmuring audible prayers for Mrs. Packletide 's ultimate estrangement from the paths of falsehood . `` I hope you do n't mind dinner being a quarter of an hour late to-night , '' said Lady Susan ; `` Motkin has had an urgent summons to go and see a sick relative this afternoon . He wanted to bicycle there , but I am sending him in the motor . '' `` How very kind of you ! Of course we do n't mind dinner being put off . '' The assurances came with unanimous and hearty sincerity . At the dinner-table that night an undercurrent of furtive curiosity directed itself towards Motkin 's impassive countenance . One or two of the guests almost expected to find a slip of paper concealed in their napkins , bearing the name of the second cousin 's selection . They had not long to wait . As the butler went round with the murmured question , '' Sherry ? '' he added in an even lower tone the cryptic words , `` Better not . '' Mrs. Packletide gave a start of alarm , and refused the sherry ; there seemed some sinister suggestion in the butler 's warning , as though her hostess had suddenly become addicted to the Borgia habit . A moment later the explanation flashed on her that `` Better Not '' was the name of one of the runners in the big race . Clovis was already pencilling it on his cuff , and Colonel Drake , in his turn , was signalling to every one in hoarse whispers and dumb-show the fact that he had all along fancied `` B.N . '' Early next morning a sheaf of telegrams went Townward , representing the market commands of the house-party and servants ' hall . It was a wet afternoon , and most of Lady Susan 's guests hung about the hall , waiting apparently for the appearance of tea , though it was scarcely yet due . The advent of a telegram quickened every one into a flutter of expectancy ; the page who brought the telegram to Clovis waited with unusual alertness to know if there might be an answer . Clovis read the message and gave an exclamation of annoyance . `` No bad news , I hope , '' said Lady Susan . Every one else knew that the news was not good . `` It 's only the result of the Derby , '' he blurted out ; `` Sadowa won ; an utter outsider . '' `` Sadowa ! '' exclaimed Lady Susan ; `` you do n't say so ! How remarkable ! It 's the first time I 've ever backed a horse ; in fact I disapprove of horse-racing , but just for once in a way I put money on this horse , and it 's gone and won . '' `` May I ask , '' said Mrs. Packletide , amid the general silence , `` why you put your money on this particular horse . None of the sporting prophets mentioned it as having an outside chance . '' `` Well , '' said Lady Susan , `` you may laugh at me , but it was the name that attracted me . You see , I was always mixed up with the Franco-German war ; I was married on the day that the war was declared , and my eldest child was born the day that peace was signed , so anything connected with the war has always interested me . And when I saw there was a horse running in the Derby called after one of the battles in the Franco-German war , I said I MUST put some money on it , for once in a way , though I disapprove of racing . And it 's actually won . '' There was a general groan . No one groaned more deeply than the professor of military history . THE SECRET SIN OF SEPTIMUS BROPE '' Who and what is Mr . Brope ? '' demanded the aunt of Clovis suddenly . Mrs. Riversedge , who had been snipping off the heads of defunct roses , and thinking of nothing in particular , sprang hurriedly to mental attention . She was one of those old-fashioned hostesses who consider that one ought to know something about one 's guests , and that the something ought to be to their credit . `` I believe he comes from Leighton Buzzard , '' she observed by way of preliminary explanation . `` In these days of rapid and convenient travel , '' said Clovis , who was dispersing a colony of green-fly with visitations of cigarette smoke , '' to come from Leighton Buzzard does not necessarily denote any great strength of character . It might only mean mere restlessness . Now if he had left it under a cloud , or as a protest against the incurable and heartless frivolity of its inhabitants , that would tell us something about the man and his mission in life . '' `` What does he do ? '' pursued Mrs. Troyle magisterially . `` He edits the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY , '' said her hostess , `` and he's enormously learned about memorial brasses and transepts and the influence of Byzantine worship on modern liturgy , and all those sort of things . Perhaps he is just a little bit heavy and immersed in one range of subjects , but it takes all sorts to make a good house-party , you know . You do n't find him TOO dull , do you ? '' `` Dullness I could overlook , '' said the aunt of Clovis ; `` what I can not forgive is his making love to my maid . '' `` My dear Mrs. Troyle , '' gasped the hostess , `` what an extraordinary idea ! I assure you Mr. Brope would not dream of doing such a thing . '' `` His dreams are a matter of indifference to me ; for all I care his slumbers may be one long indiscretion of unsuitable erotic advances , in which the entire servants ' hall may be involved . But in his waking hours he shall not make love to my maid . It 's no use arguing about it , I 'm firm on the point . '' `` But you must be mistaken , '' persisted Mrs. Riversedge ; `` Mr. Brope would be the last person to do such a thing . '' `` He is the first person to do such a thing , as far as my information goes , and if I have any voice in the matter he certainly shall be the last . Of course , I am not referring to respectably-intentioned lovers . '' `` I simply can not think that a man who writes so charmingly and informingly about transepts and Byzantine influences would behave in such an unprincipled manner , '' said Mrs. Riversedge ; `` what evidence have you that he 's doing anything of the sort ? I do n't want to doubt your word , of course , but we must n't be too ready to condemn him unheard , must we ? '' `` Whether we condemn him or not , he has certainly not been unheard . He has the room next to my dressing-room , and on two occasions , when I dare say he thought I was absent , I have plainly heard him announcing through the wall , ' I love you , Florrie . ' Those partition walls upstairs are very thin ; one can almost hear a watch ticking in the next room . '' `` Is your maid called Florence ? '' `` Her name is Florinda . '' `` What an extraordinary name to give a maid ! '' `` I did not give it to her ; she arrived in my service already christened . '' `` What I mean is , '' said Mrs. Riversedge , `` that when I get maids with unsuitable names I call them Jane ; they soon get used to it . '' `` An excellent plan , '' said the aunt of Clovis coldly ; `` unfortunately I have got used to being called Jane myself . It happens to be my name . '' She cut short Mrs. Riversedge 's flood of apologies by abruptly remarking : '' The question is not whether I 'm to call my maid Florinda , but whether Mr. Brope is to be permitted to call her Florrie . I am strongly of opinion than he shall not . '' `` He may have been repeating the words of some song , '' said Mrs. Riversedge hopefully ; `` there are lots of those sorts of silly refrains with girls ' names , '' she continued , turning to Clovis as a possible authority on the subject . `` 'You must n't call me Mary -- ' '' '' I should n't think of doing so , '' Clovis assured her ; `` in the first place , I 've always understood that your name was Henrietta ; and then I hardly know you well enough to take such a liberty . '' `` I mean there 's a SONG with that refrain , '' hurriedly explained Mrs. Riversedge , `` and there 's 'Rhoda , Rhoda kept a pagoda , ' and 'Maisie is a daisy , ' and heaps of others . Certainly it does n't sound like Mr. Brope to be singing such songs , but I think we ought to give him the benefit of the doubt . '' `` I had already done so , '' said Mrs. Troyle , `` until further evidence came my way . '' She shut her lips with the resolute finality of one who enjoys the blessed certainty of being implored to open them again . `` Further evidence ! '' exclaimed her hostess ; `` do tell me ! '' `` As I was coming upstairs after breakfast Mr. Brope was just passing my room . In the most natural way in the world a piece of paper dropped out of a packet that he held in his hand and fluttered to the ground just at my door . I was going to call out to him 'You 've dropped something , ' and then for some reason I held back and did n't show myself till he was safely in his room . You see it occurred to me that I was very seldom in my room just at that hour , and that Florinda was almost always there tidying up things about that time . So I picked up that innocent-looking piece of paper . '' Mrs. Troyle paused again , with the self-applauding air of one who has detected an asp lurking in an apple-charlotte . Mrs. Riversedge snipped vigorously at the nearest rose bush , incidentally decapitating a Viscountess Folkestone that was just coming into bloom . `` What was on the paper ? '' she asked . `` Just the words in pencil , ' I love you , Florrie , ' and then underneath , crossed out with a faint line , but perfectly plain to read , 'Meet me in the garden by the yew . ' '' `` There IS a yew tree at the bottom of the garden , '' admitted Mrs. Riversedge . `` At any rate he appears to be truthful , '' commented Clovis . `` To think that a scandal of this sort should be going on under my roof ! '' said Mrs. Riversedge indignantly . `` I wonder why it is that scandal seems so much worse under a roof , '' observed Clovis ; `` I 've always regarded it as a proof of the superior delicacy of the cat tribe that it conducts most of its scandals above the slates . '' `` Now I come to think of it , '' resumed Mrs. Riversedge , `` there are things about Mr. Brope that I 've never been able to account for . His income , for instance : he only gets two hundred a year as editor of the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY , and I know that his people are quite poor , and he has n't any private means . Yet he manages to afford a flat somewhere in Westminster , and he goes abroad to Bruges and those sorts of places every year , and always dresses well , and gives quite nice luncheon-parties in the season . You ca n't do all that on two hundred a year , can you ? '' `` Does he write for any other papers ? '' queried Mrs. Troyle . `` No , you see he specializes so entirely on liturgy and ecclesiastical architecture that his field is rather restricted . He once tried the SPORTING AND DRAMATIC with an article on church edifices in famous fox-hunting centres , but it was n't considered of sufficient general interest to be accepted . No , I do n't see how he can support himself in his present style merely by what he writes . '' `` Perhaps he sells spurious transepts to American enthusiasts , '' suggested Clovis . `` How could you sell a transept ? '' said Mrs. Riversedge ; `` such a thing would be impossible . '' `` Whatever he may do to eke out his income , '' interrupted Mrs. Troyle , '' he is certainly not going to fill in his leisure moments by making love to my maid . '' `` Of course not , '' agreed her hostess ; `` that must be put a stop to at once . But I do n't quite know what we ought to do . '' `` You might put a barbed wire entanglement round the yew tree as a precautionary measure , '' said Clovis . `` I do n't think that the disagreeable situation that has arisen is improved by flippancy , '' said Mrs. Riversedge ; `` a good maid is a treasure -- '' '' I am sure I do n't know what I should do without Florinda , '' admitted Mrs. Troyle ; `` she understands my hair . I 've long ago given up trying to do anything with it myself . I regard one 's hair as I regard husbands : as long as one is seen together in public one 's private divergences do n't matter . Surely that was the luncheon gong . '' Septimus Brope and Clovis had the smoking-room to themselves after lunch . The former seemed restless and preoccupied , the latter quietly observant . `` What is a lorry ? '' asked Septimus suddenly ; `` I do n't mean the thing on wheels , of course I know what that is , but is n't there a bird with a name like that , the larger form of a lorikeet ? '' `` I fancy it 's a lory , with one ' r , ' '' said Clovis lazily , `` in which case it 's no good to you . '' Septimus Brope stared in some astonishment . `` How do you mean , no good to me ? '' he asked , with more than a trace of uneasiness in his voice . `` Wo n't rhyme with Florrie , '' explained Clovis briefly . Septimus sat upright in his chair , with unmistakable alarm on his face . `` How did you find out ? I mean how did you know I was trying to get a rhyme to Florrie ? '' he asked sharply . `` I did n't know , '' said Clovis , `` I only guessed . When you wanted to turn the prosaic lorry of commerce into a feathered poem flitting through the verdure of a tropical forest , I knew you must be working up a sonnet , and Florrie was the only female name that suggested itself as rhyming with lorry . '' Septimus still looked uneasy . `` I believe you know more , '' he said . Clovis laughed quietly , but said nothing . `` How much do you know ? '' Septimus asked desperately . `` The yew tree in the garden , '' said Clovis . `` There ! I felt certain I 'd dropped it somewhere . But you must have guessed something before . Look here , you have surprised my secret . You wo n't give me away , will you ? It is nothing to be ashamed of , but it would n't do for the editor of the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY to go in openly for that sort of thing , would it ? '' `` Well , I suppose not , '' admitted Clovis . `` You see , '' continued Septimus , `` I get quite a decent lot of money out of it . I could never live in the style I do on what I get as editor of the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY . '' Clovis was even more startled than Septimus had been earlier in the conversation , but he was better skilled in repressing surprise . `` Do you mean to say you get money out of -- Florrie ? '' he asked . `` Not out of Florrie , as yet , '' said Septimus ; `` in fact , I do n't mind saying that I 'm having a good deal of trouble over Florrie . But there are a lot of others . '' Clovis 's cigarette went out . `` This is VERY interesting , '' he said slowly . And then , with Septimus Brope 's next words , illumination dawned on him . `` There are heaps of others ; for instance : 'Cora with the lips of coral , You and I will never quarrel . ' That was one of my earliest successes , and it still brings me in royalties . And then there is -- 'Esmeralda , when I first beheld her , ' and 'Fair Teresa , how I love to please her , ' both of those have been fairly popular . And there is one rather dreadful one , '' continued Septimus , flushing deep carmine , `` which has brought me in more money than any of the others : 'Lively little Lucie With her naughty nez retroussé . ' Of course , I loathe the whole lot of them ; in fact , I 'm rapidly becoming something of a woman-hater under their influence , but I can't afford to disregard the financial aspect of the matter . And at the same time you can understand that my position as an authority on ecclesiastical architecture and liturgical subjects would be weakened , if not altogether ruined , if it once got about that I was the author of 'Cora with the lips of coral ' and all the rest of them . '' Clovis had recovered sufficiently to ask in a sympathetic , if rather unsteady , voice what was the special trouble with `` Florrie . '' `` I ca n't get her into lyric shape , try as I will , '' said Septimus mournfully . `` You see , one has to work in a lot of sentimental , sugary compliment with a catchy rhyme , and a certain amount of personal biography or prophecy . They 've all of them got to have a long string of past successes recorded about them , or else you 've got to foretell blissful things about them and yourself in the future . For instance , there is : 'Dainty little girlie Mavis , She is such a rara avis , All the money I can save is All to be for Mavis mine . ' It goes to a sickening namby-pamby waltz tune , and for months nothing else was sung and hummed in Blackpool and other popular centres . '' This time Clovis 's self-control broke down badly . `` Please excuse me , '' he gurgled , `` but I ca n't help it when I remember the awful solemnity of that article of yours that you so kindly read us last night , on the Coptic Church in its relation to early Christian worship . '' Septimus groaned . `` You see how it would be , '' he said ; `` as soon as people knew me to be the author of that miserable sentimental twaddle , all respect for the serious labours of my life would be gone . I dare say I know more about memorial brasses than anyone living , in fact I hope one day to publish a monograph on the subject , but I should be pointed out everywhere as the man whose ditties were in the mouths of nigger minstrels along the entire coast-line of our Island home . Can you wonder that I positively hate Florrie all the time that I 'm trying to grind out sugar-coated rhapsodies about her . '' `` Why not give free play to your emotions , and be brutally abusive ? An uncomplimentary refrain would have an instant success as a novelty if you were sufficiently outspoken . '' `` I 've never thought of that , '' said Septimus , `` and I 'm afraid I couldn't break away from the habit of fulsome adulation and suddenly change my style . '' `` You need n't change your style in the least , '' said Clovis ; `` merely reverse the sentiment and keep to the inane phraseology of the thing . If you 'll do the body of the song I 'll knock off the refrain , which is the thing that principally matters , I believe . I shall charge half-shares in the royalties , and throw in my silence as to your guilty secret . In the eyes of the world you shall still be the man who has devoted his life to the study of transepts and Byzantine ritual ; only sometimes , in the long winter evenings , when the wind howls drearily down the chimney and the rain beats against the windows , I shall think of you as the author of 'Cora with the lips of coral . ' Of course , if in sheer gratitude at my silence you like to take me for a much-needed holiday to the Adriatic or somewhere equally interesting , paying all expenses , I should n't dream of refusing . '' Later in the afternoon Clovis found his aunt and Mrs. Riversedge indulging in gentle exercise in the Jacobean garden . `` I 've spoken to Mr. Brope about F. , '' he announced . `` How splendid of you ! What did he say ? '' came in a quick chorus from the two ladies . `` He was quite frank and straightforward with me when he saw that I knew his secret , '' said Clovis , `` and it seems that his intentions were quite serious , if slightly unsuitable . I tried to show him the impracticability of the course that he was following . He said he wanted to be understood , and he seemed to think that Florinda would excel in that requirement , but I pointed out that there were probably dozens of delicately nurtured , pure-hearted young English girls who would be capable of understanding him , while Florinda was the only person in the world who understood my aunt 's hair . That rather weighed with him , for he 's not really a selfish animal , if you take him in the right way , and when I appealed to the memory of his happy childish days , spent amid the daisied fields of Leighton Buzzard ( I suppose daisies do grow there ) , he was obviously affected . Anyhow , he gave me his word that he would put Florinda absolutely out of his mind , and he has agreed to go for a short trip abroad as the best distraction for his thoughts . I am going with him as far as Ragusa . If my aunt should wish to give me a really nice scarf-pin ( to be chosen by myself ) , as a small recognition of the very considerable service I have done her , I should n't dream of refusing . I 'm not one of those who think that because one is abroad one can go about dressed anyhow . '' A few weeks later in Blackpool and places where they sing , the following refrain held undisputed sway : `` How you bore me , Florrie , With those eyes of vacant blue ; You 'll be very sorry , Florrie , If I marry you . Though I 'm easygoin ' , Florrie , This I swear is true , I 'll throw you down a quarry , Florrie , If I marry you . '' `` MINISTERS OF GRACE '' Although he was scarcely yet out of his teens , the Duke of Scaw was already marked out as a personality widely differing from others of his caste and period . Not in externals ; therein he conformed correctly to type . His hair was faintly reminiscent of Houbigant , and at the other end of him his shoes exhaled the right SOUPÇON of harness-room ; his socks compelled one 's attention without losing one 's respect ; and his attitude in repose had just that suggestion of Whistler 's mother , so becoming in the really young . It was within that the trouble lay , if trouble it could be accounted , which marked him apart from his fellows . The Duke was religious . Not in any of the ordinary senses of the word ; he took small heed of High Church or Evangelical standpoints , he stood outside of all the movements and missions and cults and crusades of the day , uncaring and uninterested . Yet in a mystical-practical way of his own , which had served him unscathed and unshaken through the fickle years of boyhood , he was intensely and intensively religious . His family were naturally , though unobtrusively , distressed about it . `` I am so afraid it may affect his bridge , '' said his mother . The Duke sat in a pennyworth of chair in St. James 's Park , listening to the pessimisms of Belturbet , who reviewed the existing political situation from the gloomiest of standpoints . `` Where I think you political spade-workers are so silly , '' said the Duke , `` is in the misdirection of your efforts . You spend thousands of pounds of money , and Heaven knows how much dynamic force of brain power and personal energy , in trying to elect or displace this or that man , whereas you could gain your ends so much more simply by making use of the men as you find them . If they do n't suit your purpose as they are , transform them into something more satisfactory . '' `` Do you refer to hypnotic suggestion ? '' asked Belturbet , with the air of one who is being trifled with . `` Nothing of the sort . Do you understand what I mean by the verb to koepenick ? That is to say , to replace an authority by a spurious imitation that would carry just as much weight for the moment as the displaced original ; the advantage , of course , being that the koepenick replica would do what you wanted , whereas the original does what seems best in its own eyes . '' `` I suppose every public man has a double , if not two or three , '' said Belturbet ; `` but it would be a pretty hard task to koepenick a whole bunch of them and keep the originals out of the way . '' `` There have been instances in European history of highly successful koepenickery , '' said the Duke dreamily . `` Oh , of course , there have been False Dimitris and Perkin Warbecks , who imposed on the world for a time , '' assented Belturbet , `` but they personated people who were dead or safely out of the way . That was a comparatively simple matter . It would be far easier to pass oneself of as dead Hannibal than as living Haldane , for instance . '' `` I was thinking , '' said the Duke , `` of the most famous case of all , the angel who koepenicked King Robert of Sicily with such brilliant results . Just imagine what an advantage it would be to have angels deputizing , to use a horrible but convenient word , for Quinston and Lord Hugo Sizzle , for example . How much smoother the Parliamentary machine would work than at present ! '' `` Now you 're talking nonsense , '' said Belturbet ; `` angels do n't exist nowadays , at least , not in that way , so what is the use of dragging them into a serious discussion ? It 's merely silly . '' `` If you talk to me like that I shall just DO it , '' said the Duke . `` Do what ? '' asked Belturbet . There were times when his young friend's uncanny remarks rather frightened him . `` I shall summon angelic forces to take over some of the more troublesome personalities of our public life , and I shall send the ousted originals into temporary retirement in suitable animal organisms . It 's not every one who would have the knowledge or the power necessary to bring such a thing off -- '' '' Oh , stop that inane rubbish , '' said Belturbet angrily ; `` it 's getting wearisome . Here 's Quinston coming , '' he added , as there approached along the almost deserted path the well-known figure of a young Cabinet Minister , whose personality evoked a curious mixture of public interest and unpopularity . `` Hurry along , my dear man , '' said the young Duke to the Minister , who had given him a condescending nod ; `` your time is running short , '' he continued in a provocative strain ; `` the whole inept crowd of you will shortly be swept away into the world 's waste-paper basket . '' `` You poor little strawberry-leafed nonentity , '' said the Minister , checking himself for a moment in his stride and rolling out his words spasmodically ; `` who is going to sweep us away , I should like to know ? The voting masses are on our side , and all the ability and administrative talent is on our side too . No power of earth or Heaven is going to move us from our place till we choose to quit it . No power of earth or -- '' Belturbet saw , with bulging eyes , a sudden void where a moment earlier had been a Cabinet Minister ; a void emphasized rather than relieved by the presence of a puffed-out bewildered-looking sparrow , which hopped about for a moment in a dazed fashion and then fell to a violent cheeping and scolding . `` If we could understand sparrow-language , '' said the Duke serenely , `` I fancy we should hear something infinitely worse than 'strawberry-leafed nonentity . ' '' `` But good Heavens , Eugène , '' said Belturbet hoarsely , `` what has become of -- Why , there he is ! How on earth did he get there ? '' And he pointed with a shaking finger towards a semblance of the vanished Minister , which approached once more along the unfrequented path . The Duke laughed . `` It is Quinston to all outward appearance , '' he said composedly , `` but I fancy you will find , on closer investigation , that it is an angel understudy of the real article . '' The Angel-Quinston greeted them with a friendly smile . `` How beastly happy you two look sitting there ! '' he said wistfully . `` I do n't suppose you 'd care to change places with poor little us , '' replied the Duke chaffingly . `` How about poor little me ? '' said the Angel modestly . `` I 've got to run about behind the wheels of popularity , like a spotted dog behind a carriage , getting all the dust and trying to look as if I was an important part of the machine . I must seem a perfect fool to you onlookers sometimes . '' `` I think you are a perfect angel , '' said the Duke . The Angel-that-had-been-Quinston smiled and passed on his way , pursued across the breadth of the Horse Guards Parade by a tiresome little sparrow that cheeped incessantly and furiously at him . `` That 's only the beginning , '' said the Duke complacently ; `` I 've made it operative with all of them , irrespective of parties . '' Belturbet made no coherent reply ; he was engaged in feeling his pulse . The Duke fixed his attention with some interest on a black swan that was swimming with haughty , stiff-necked aloofness amid the crowd of lesser water-fowl that dotted the ornamental water . For all its pride of bearing , something was evidently ruffling and enraging it ; in its way it seemed as angry and amazed as the sparrow had been . At the same moment a human figure came along the pathway . Belturbet looked up apprehensively . `` Kedzon , '' he whispered briefly . `` An Angel-Kedzon , if I am not mistaken , '' said the Duke . `` Look , he is talking affably to a human being . That settles it . '' A shabbily dressed lounger had accosted the man who had been Viceroy in the splendid East , and who still reflected in his mien some of the cold dignity of the Himalayan snow-peaks . `` Could you tell me , sir , if them white birds is storks or halbatrosses ? I had an argyment -- '' The cold dignity thawed at once into genial friendliness . `` Those are pelicans , my dear sir . Are you interested in birds ? If you would join me in a bun and a glass of milk at the stall yonder , I could tell you some interesting things about Indian birds . Right oh ! Now the hill-mynah , for instance -- '' The two men disappeared in the direction of the bun stall , chatting volubly as they went , and shadowed from the other side of the railed enclosure by a black swan , whose temper seemed to have reached the limit of inarticulate rage . Belturbet gazed in an open-mouthed wonder after the retreating couple , then transferred his attention to the infuriated swan , and finally turned with a look of scared comprehension at his young friend lolling unconcernedly in his chair . There was no longer any room to doubt what was happening . The `` silly talk '' had been translated into terrifying action . `` I think a prairie oyster on the top of a stiffish brandy-and-soda might save my reason , '' said Belturbet weakly , as he limped towards his club . It was late in the day before he could steady his nerves sufficiently to glance at the evening papers . The Parliamentary report proved significant reading , and confirmed the fears that he had been trying to shake off . Mr. Ap Dave , the Chancellor , whose lively controversial style endeared him to his supporters and embittered him , politically speaking , to his opponents , had risen in his place to make an unprovoked apology for having alluded in a recent speech to certain protesting taxpayers as `` skulkers . '' He had realized on reflection that they were in all probability perfectly honest in their inability to understand certain legal technicalities of the new finance laws . The House had scarcely recovered from this sensation when Lord Hugo Sizzle caused a further flutter of astonishment by going out of his way to indulge in an outspoken appreciation of the fairness , loyalty , and straightforwardness not only of the Chancellor , but of all the members of the Cabinet . A wit had gravely suggested moving the adjournment of the House in view of the unexpected circumstances that had arisen . Belturbet anxiously skimmed over a further item of news printed immediately below the Parliamentary report : `` Wild cat found in an exhausted condition in Palace Yard . '' `` Now I wonder which of them -- '' he mused , and then an appalling idea came to him . `` Supposing he 's put them both into the same beast ! '' He hurriedly ordered another prairie oyster . Belturbet was known in his club as a strictly moderate drinker ; his consumption of alcoholic stimulants that day gave rise to considerable comment . The events of the next few days were piquantly bewildering to the world at large ; to Belturbet , who knew dimly what was happening , the situation was fraught with recurring alarms . The old saying that in politics it 's the unexpected that always happens received a justification that it had hitherto somewhat lacked , and the epidemic of startling personal changes of front was not wholly confined to the realm of actual politics . The eminent chocolate magnate , Sadbury , whose antipathy to the Turf and everything connected with it was a matter of general knowledge , had evidently been replaced by an Angel-Sadbury , who proceeded to electrify the public by blossoming forth as an owner of race-horses , giving as a reason his matured conviction that the sport was , after all , one which gave healthy open-air recreation to large numbers of people drawn from all classes of the community , and incidentally stimulated the important industry of horse-breeding . His colours , chocolate and cream hoops spangled with pink stars , promised to become as popular as any on the Turf . At the same time , in order to give effect to his condemnation of the evils resulting from the spread of the gambling habit among wage-earning classes , who lived for the most part from hand to mouth , he suppressed all betting news and tipsters ' forecasts in the popular evening paper that was under his control . His action received instant recognition and support from the Angel-proprietor of the EVENING VIEWS , the principal rival evening halfpenny paper , who forthwith issued an ukase decreeing a similar ban on betting news , and in a short while the regular evening Press was purged of all mention of starting prices and probable winners . A considerable drop in the circulation of all these papers was the immediate result , accompanied , of course , by a falling-off in advertisement value , while a crop of special betting broadsheets sprang up to supply the newly-created want . Under their influence the betting habit became if anything rather more widely diffused than before . The Duke had possibly overlooked the futility of koepenicking the leaders of the nation with excellently intentioned angel under-studies , while leaving the mass of the people in its original condition . Further sensation and dislocation was caused in the Press world by the sudden and dramatic RAPPROCHEMENT which took place between the Angel-Editor of the SCRUTATOR and the Angel-Editor of the ANGLIAN REVIEW , who not only ceased to criticize and disparage the tone and tendencies of each other 's publication , but agreed to exchange editorships for alternating periods . Here again public support was not on the side of the angels ; constant readers of the SCRUTATOR complained bitterly of the strong meat which was thrust upon them at fitful intervals in place of the almost vegetarian diet to which they had become confidently accustomed ; even those who were not mentally averse to strong meat as a separate course were pardonably annoyed at being supplied with it in the pages of the SCRUTATOR . To be suddenly confronted with a pungent herring salad when one had attuned oneself to tea and toast , or to discover a richly truffled segment of PATÉ DE FOIE dissembled in a bowl of bread and milk , would be an experience that might upset the equanimity of the most placidly disposed mortal . An equally vehement outcry arose from the regular subscribers of the ANGLIAN REVIEW who protested against being served from time to time with literary fare which no young person of sixteen could possibly want to devour in secret . To take infinite precautions , they complained , against the juvenile perusal of such eminently innocuous literature was like reading the Riot Act on an uninhabited island . Both reviews suffered a serious falling-off in circulation and influence . Peace hath its devastations as well as war . The wives of noted public men formed another element of discomfiture which the young Duke had almost entirely left out of his calculations . It is sufficiently embarrassing to keep abreast of the possible wobblings and veerings-round of a human husband , who , from the strength or weakness of his personal character , may leap over or slip through the barriers which divide the parties ; for this reason a merciful politician usually marries late in life , when he has definitely made up his mind on which side he wishes his wife to be socially valuable . But these trials were as nothing compared to the bewilderment caused by the Angel-husbands who seemed in some cases to have revolutionized their outlook on life in the interval between breakfast and dinner , without premonition or preparation of any kind , and apparently without realizing the least need for subsequent explanation . The temporary peace which brooded over the Parliamentary situation was by no means reproduced in the home circles of the leading statesmen and politicians . It had been frequently and extensively remarked of Mrs. Exe that she would try the patience of an angel ; now the tables were reversed , and she unwittingly had an opportunity for discovering that the capacity for exasperating behaviour was not all on one side . And then , with the introduction of the Navy Estimates , Parliamentary peace suddenly dissolved . It was the old quarrel between Ministers and the Opposition as to the adequacy or the reverse of the Government's naval programme . The Angel-Quinston and the Angel-Hugo-Sizzle contrived to keep the debates free from personalities and pinpricks , but an enormous sensation was created when the elegant lackadaisical Halfan Halfour threatened to bring up fifty thousand stalwarts to wreck the House if the Estimates were not forthwith revised on a Two-Power basis . It was a memorable scene when he rose in his place , in response to the scandalized shouts of his opponents , and thundered forth , '' Gentlemen , I glory in the name of Apache . '' Belturbet , who had made several fruitless attempts to ring up his young friend since the fateful morning in St. James 's Park , ran him to earth one afternoon at his club , smooth and spruce and unruffled as ever . `` Tell me , what on earth have you turned Cocksley Coxon into ? '' Belturbet asked anxiously , mentioning the name of one of the pillars of unorthodoxy in the Anglican Church . `` I do n't fancy he BELIEVES in angels , and if he finds an angel preaching orthodox sermons from his pulpit while he 's been turned into a fox-terrier , he 'll develop rabies in less than no time . '' `` I rather think it was a fox-terrier , '' said the Duke lazily . Belturbet groaned heavily , and sank into a chair . `` Look here , Eugène , '' he whispered hoarsely , having first looked well round to see that no one was within hearing range , `` you 've got to stop it . Consols are jumping up and down like bronchos , and that speech of Halfour 's in the House last night has simply startled everybody out of their wits . And then on the top of it , Thistlebery -- '' '' What has he been saying ? '' asked the Duke quickly . `` Nothing . That 's just what 's so disturbing . Every one thought it was simply inevitable that he should come out with a great epoch-making speech at this juncture , and I 've just seen on the tape that he has refused to address any meetings at present , giving as a reason his opinion that something more than mere speech-making was wanted . '' The young Duke said nothing , but his eyes shone with quiet exultation . `` It 's so unlike Thistlebery , '' continued Belturbet ; `` at least , '' he said suspiciously , `` it 's unlike the REAL Thistlebery -- '' '' The real Thistlebery is flying about somewhere as a vocally-industrious lapwing , '' said the Duke calmly ; `` I expect great things of the Angel-Thistlebery , '' he added . At this moment there was a magnetic stampede of members towards the lobby , where the tape-machines were ticking out some news of more than ordinary import . `` COUP D'ÉTAT in the North . Thistlebery seizes Edinburgh Castle . Threatens civil war unless Government expands naval programme . '' In the babel which ensued Belturbet lost sight of his young friend . For the best part of the afternoon he searched one likely haunt after another , spurred on by the sensational posters which the evening papers were displaying broadcast over the West End . `` General Baden-Baden mobilizes Boy-Scouts . Another COUP D'ÉTAT feared . Is Windsor Castle safe ? '' This was one of the earlier posters , and was followed by one of even more sinister purport : `` Will the Test-match have to be postponed ? '' It was this disquietening question which brought home the real seriousness of the situation to the London public , and made people wonder whether one might not pay too high a price for the advantages of party government . Belturbet , questing round in the hope of finding the originator of the trouble , with a vague idea of being able to induce him to restore matters to their normal human footing , came across an elderly club acquaintance who dabbled extensively in some of the more sensitive market securities . He was pale with indignation , and his pallor deepened as a breathless newsboy dashed past with a poster inscribed : `` Premier 's constituency harried by moss-troopers . Halfour sends encouraging telegram to rioters . Letchworth Garden City threatens reprisals . Foreigners taking refuge in Embassies and National Liberal Club . '' `` This is devils ' work ! '' he said angrily . Belturbet knew otherwise . At the bottom of St. James 's Street a newspaper motor-cart , which had just come rapidly along Pall Mall , was surrounded by a knot of eagerly talking people , and for the first time that afternoon Belturbet heard expressions of relief and congratulation . It displayed a placard with the welcome announcement : `` Crisis ended . Government gives way . Important expansion of naval programme . '' There seemed to be no immediate necessity for pursuing the quest of the errant Duke , and Belturbet turned to make his way homeward through St. James 's Park . His mind , attuned to the alarums and excursions of the afternoon , became dimly aware that some excitement of a detached nature was going on around him . In spite of the political ferment which reigned in the streets , quite a large crowd had gathered to watch the unfolding of a tragedy that had taken place on the shore of the ornamental water . A large black swan , which had recently shown signs of a savage and dangerous disposition , had suddenly attacked a young gentleman who was walking by the water 's edge , dragged him down under the surface , and drowned him before anyone could come to his assistance . At the moment when Belturbet arrived on the spot several park-keepers were engaged in lifting the corpse into a punt . Belturbet stooped to pick up a hat that lay near the scene of the struggle . It was a smart soft felt hat , faintly reminiscent of Houbigant . More than a month elapsed before Belturbet had sufficiently recovered from his attack of nervous prostration to take an interest once more in what was going on in the world of politics . The Parliamentary Session was still in full swing , and a General Election was looming in the near future . He called for a batch of morning papers and skimmed rapidly through the speeches of the Chancellor , Quinston , and other Ministerial leaders , as well as those of the principal Opposition champions , and then sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief . Evidently the spell had ceased to act after the tragedy which had overtaken its invoker . There was no trace of angel anywhere . THE REMOULDING OF GROBY LINGTON '' A man is known by the company he keeps . '' In the morning-room of his sister-in-law 's house Groby Lington fidgeted away the passing minutes with the demure restlessness of advanced middle age . About a quarter of an hour would have to elapse before it would be time to say his good-byes and make his way across the village green to the station , with a selected escort of nephews and nieces . He was a good-natured , kindly dispositioned man , and in theory he was delighted to pay periodical visits to the wife and children of his dead brother William ; in practice , he infinitely preferred the comfort and seclusion of his own house and garden , and the companionship of his books and his parrot to these rather meaningless and tiresome incursions into a family circle with which he had little in common . It was not so much the spur of his own conscience that drove him to make the occasional short journey by rail to visit his relatives , as an obedient concession to the more insistent but vicarious conscience of his brother , Colonel John , who was apt to accuse him of neglecting poor old William 's family . Groby usually forgot or ignored the existence of his neighbour kinsfolk until such time as he was threatened with a visit from the Colonel , when he would put matters straight by a hurried pilgrimage across the few miles of intervening country to renew his acquaintance with the young people and assume a kindly if rather forced interest in the well-being of his sister-in-law . On this occasion he had cut matters so fine between the timing of his exculpatory visit and the coming of Colonel John , that he would scarcely be home before the latter was due to arrive . Anyhow , Groby had got it over , and six or seven months might decently elapse before he need again sacrifice his comforts and inclinations on the altar of family sociability . He was inclined to be distinctly cheerful as he hopped about the room , picking up first one object , then another , and subjecting each to a brief bird-like scrutiny . Presently his cheerful listlessness changed sharply to an attitude of vexed attention . In a scrap-book of drawings and caricatures belonging to one of his nephews he had come across an unkindly clever sketch of himself and his parrot , solemnly confronting each other in postures of ridiculous gravity and repose , and bearing a likeness to one another that the artist had done his utmost to accentuate . After the first flush of annoyance had passed away , Groby laughed good-naturedly and admitted to himself the cleverness of the drawing . Then the feeling of resentment repossessed him , resentment not against the caricaturist who had embodied the idea in pen and ink , but against the possible truth that the idea represented . Was it really the case that people grew in time to resemble the animals they kept as pets , and had he unconsciously become more and more like the comically solemn bird that was his constant companion ? Groby was unusually silent as he walked to the train with his escort of chattering nephews and nieces , and during the short railway journey his mind was more and more possessed with an introspective conviction that he had gradually settled down into a sort of parrot-like existence . What , after all , did his daily routine amount to but a sedate meandering and pecking and perching , in his garden , among his fruit trees , in his wicker chair on the lawn , or by the fireside in his library ? And what was the sum total of his conversation with chance-encountered neighbours ? `` Quite a spring day , is n't it ? '' `` It looks as though we should have some rain . '' `` Glad to see you about again ; you must take care of yourself . '' `` How the young folk shoot up , do n't they ? '' Strings of stupid , inevitable perfunctory remarks came to his mind , remarks that were certainly not the mental exchange of human intelligences , but mere empty parrot-talk . One might really just as well salute one 's acquaintances with `` Pretty polly . Puss , puss , miaow ! '' Groby began to fume against the picture of himself as a foolish feathered fowl which his nephew 's sketch had first suggested , and which his own accusing imagination was filling in with such unflattering detail . `` I 'll give the beastly bird away , '' he said resentfully ; though he knew at the same time that he would do no such thing . It would look so absurd after all the years that he had kept the parrot and made much of it suddenly to try and find it a new home . `` Has my brother arrived ? '' he asked of the stable-boy , who had come with the pony-carriage to meet him . `` Yessir , came down by the two-fifteen . Your parrot 's dead . '' The boy made the latter announcement with the relish which his class finds in proclaiming a catastrophe . `` My parrot dead ? '' said Groby . `` What caused its death ? '' `` The ipe , '' said the boy briefly . `` The ipe ? '' queried Groby . `` Whatever 's that ? '' `` The ipe what the Colonel brought down with him , '' came the rather alarming answer . `` Do you mean to say my brother is ill ? '' asked Groby . `` Is it something infectious ? '' `` Th ' Colonel 's so well as ever he was , '' said the boy ; and as no further explanation was forthcoming Groby had to possess himself in mystified patience till he reached home . His brother was waiting for him at the hall door . `` Have you heard about the parrot ? '' he asked at once . `` 'Pon my soul I'm awfully sorry . The moment he saw the monkey I 'd brought down as a surprise for you he squawked out 'Rats to you , sir ! ' and the blessed monkey made one spring at him , got him by the neck and whirled him round like a rattle . He was as dead as mutton by the time I 'd got him out of the little beggar 's paws . Always been such a friendly little beast , the monkey has , should never have thought he 'd got it in him to see red like that . Ca n't tell you how sorry I feel about it , and now of course you 'll hate the sight of the monkey . '' `` Not at all , '' said Groby sincerely . A few hours earlier the tragic end which had befallen his parrot would have presented itself to him as a calamity ; now it arrived almost as a polite attention on the part of the Fates . `` The bird was getting old , you know , '' he went on , in explanation of his obvious lack of decent regret at the loss of his pet . `` I was really beginning to wonder if it was an unmixed kindness to let him go on living till he succumbed to old age . What a charming little monkey ! '' he added , when he was introduced to the culprit . The new-comer was a small , long-tailed monkey from the Western Hemisphere , with a gentle , half-shy , half-trusting manner that instantly captured Groby 's confidence ; a student of simian character might have seen in the fitful red light in its eyes some indication of the underlying temper which the parrot had so rashly put to the test with such dramatic consequences for itself . The servants , who had come to regard the defunct bird as a regular member of the household , and one who gave really very little trouble , were scandalized to find his bloodthirsty aggressor installed in his place as an honoured domestic pet . `` A nasty heathen ipe what do n't never say nothing sensible and cheerful , same as pore Polly did , '' was the unfavourable verdict of the kitchen quarters . * * * * * One Sunday morning , some twelve or fourteen months after the visit of Colonel John and the parrot-tragedy , Miss Wepley sat decorously in her pew in the parish church , immediately in front of that occupied by Groby Lington . She was , comparatively speaking a new-comer in the neighbourhood , and was not personally acquainted with her fellow-worshipper in the seat behind , but for the past two years the Sunday morning service had brought them regularly within each other's sphere of consciousness . Without having paid particular attention to the subject , she could probably have given a correct rendering of the way in which he pronounced certain words occurring in the responses , while he was well aware of the trivial fact that , in addition to her prayer book and handkerchief , a small paper packet of throat lozenges always reposed on the seat beside her . Miss Wepley rarely had recourse to her lozenges , but in case she should be taken with a fit of coughing she wished to have the emergency duly provided for . On this particular Sunday the lozenges occasioned an unusual diversion in the even tenor of her devotions , far more disturbing to her personally than a prolonged attack of coughing would have been . As she rose to take part in the singing of the first hymn , she fancied that she saw the hand of her neighbour , who was alone in the pew behind her , make a furtive downward grab at the packet lying on the seat ; on turning sharply round she found that the packet had certainly disappeared , but Mr. Lington was to all outward seeming serenely intent on his hymnbook . No amount of interrogatory glaring on the part of the despoiled lady could bring the least shade of conscious guilt to his face . `` Worse was to follow , '' as she remarked afterwards to a scandalized audience of friends and acquaintances . `` I had scarcely knelt in prayer when a lozenge , one of my lozenges , came whizzing into the pew , just under my nose . I turned round and stared , but Mr. Lington had his eyes closed and his lips moving as though engaged in prayer . The moment I resumed my devotions another lozenge came rattling in , and then another . I took no notice for awhile , and then turned round suddenly just as the dreadful man was about to flip another one at me . He hastily pretended to be turning over the leaves of his book , but I was not to be taken in that time . He saw that he had been discovered and no more lozenges came . Of course I have changed my pew . '' `` No gentleman would have acted in such a disgraceful manner , '' said one of her listeners ; `` and yet Mr. Lington used to be so respected by everybody . He seems to have behaved like a little ill-bred schoolboy . '' `` He behaved like a monkey , '' said Miss Wepley . Her unfavourable verdict was echoed in other quarters about the same time . Groby Lington had never been a hero in the eyes of his personal retainers , but he had shared the approval accorded to his defunct parrot as a cheerful , well-dispositioned body , who gave no particular trouble . Of late months , however , this character would hardly have been endorsed by the members of his domestic establishment . The stolid stable-boy , who had first announced to him the tragic end of his feathered pet , was one of the first to give voice to the murmurs of disapproval which became rampant and general in the servants ' quarters , and he had fairly substantial grounds for his disaffection . In a burst of hot summer weather he had obtained permission to bathe in a modest-sized pond in the orchard , and thither one afternoon Groby had Produced by Richard E.

MILNE TO THE LYNX KITTEN , WITH HIS RELUCTANTLY GIVEN CONSENT , THIS BOOK IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED H. H. M. August , 1911 INTRODUCTION There are good things which we want to share with the world and good things which we want to keep to ourselves . The secret of our favourite restaurant , to take a case , is guarded jealously from all but a few intimates ; the secret , to take a contrary case , of our infallible remedy for seasickness is thrust upon every traveller we meet , even if he be no more than a casual acquaintance about to cross the Serpentine . So with our books . There are dearly loved books of which we babble to a neighbour at dinner , insisting that she shall share our delight in them ; and there are books , equally dear to us , of which we say nothing , fearing lest the praise of others should cheapen the glory of our discovery . The books of `` Saki '' were , for me at least , in the second class . It was in the WESTMINSTER GAZETTE that I discovered him ( I like to remember now ) almost as soon as he was discoverable . Let us spare a moment , and a tear , for those golden days in the early nineteen hundreds , when there were five leisurely papers of an evening in which the free-lance might graduate , and he could speak of his Alma Mater , whether the GLOBE or the PALL MALL , with as much pride as , he never doubted , the GLOBE or the PALL MALL would speak one day of him . Myself but lately down from ST. JAMES ' , I was not too proud to take some slight but pitying interest in men of other colleges . The unusual name of a freshman up at WESTMINSTER attracted my attention ; I read what he had to say ; and it was only by reciting rapidly with closed eyes the names of our own famous alumni , beginning confidently with Barrie and ending , now very doubtfully , with myself , that I was able to preserve my equanimity . Later one heard that this undergraduate from overseas had gone up at an age more advanced than customary ; and just as Cambridge men have been known to complain of the maturity of Oxford Rhodes scholars , so one felt that this WESTMINSTER free-lance in the thirties was no fit competitor for the youth of other colleges . Indeed , it could not compete . Well , I discovered him , but only to the few , the favoured , did I speak of him . It may have been my uncertainty ( which still persists ) whether he called himself Sayki , Sahki or Sakki which made me thus ungenerous of his name , or it may have been the feeling that the others were not worthy of him ; but how refreshing it was when some intellectually blown-up stranger said `` Do you ever read Saki ? '' to reply , with the same pronunciation and even greater condescension : `` Saki ! He has been my favourite author for years ! '' A strange exotic creature , this Saki , to us many others who were trying to do it too . For we were so domestic , he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan . While we were being funny , as planned , with collar-studs and hot-water bottles , he was being much funnier with werwolves and tigers . Our little dialogues were between John and Mary ; his , and how much better , between Bertie van Tahn and the Baroness . Even the most casual intruder into one of his sketches , as it might be our Tomkins , had to be called Belturbet or de Ropp , and for his hero , weary man-of-the-world at seventeen , nothing less thrilling than Clovis Sangrail would do . In our envy we may have wondered sometimes if it were not much easier to be funny with tigers than with collar-studs ; if Saki 's careless cruelty , that strange boyish insensitiveness of his , did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter . It may have been so ; but , fortunately , our efforts to be funny in the Saki manner have not survived to prove it . What is Saki 's manner , what his magic talisman ? Like every artist worth consideration , he had no recipe . If his exotic choice of subject was often his strength , it was often his weakness ; if his insensitiveness carried him through , at times , to victory , it brought him , at times , to defeat . I do not think that he has that `` mastery of the CONTE '' -- in this book at least -- which some have claimed for him . Such mastery infers a passion for tidiness which was not in the boyish Saki 's equipment . He leaves loose ends everywhere . Nor in his dialogue , delightful as it often is , funny as it nearly always is , is he the supreme master ; too much does it become monologue judiciously fed , one character giving and the other taking . But in comment , in reference , in description , in every development of his story , he has a choice of words , a `` way of putting things '' which is as inevitably his own vintage as , once tasted , it becomes the private vintage of the connoisseur . Let us take a sample or two of `` Saki , 1911 . '' `` The earlier stages of the dinner had worn off . The wine lists had been consulted , by some with the blank embarrassment of a schoolboy suddenly called upon to locate a Minor Prophet in the tangled hinterland of the Old Testament , by others with the severe scrutiny which suggests that they have visited most of the higher-priced wines in their own homes and probed their family weaknesses . '' `` Locate '' is the pleasant word here . Still more satisfying , in the story of the man who was tattooed `` from collar-bone to waist-line with a glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus , '' is the word '' privilege '' : '' The design when finally developed was a slight disappointment to Monsieur Deplis , who had suspected Icarus of being a fortress taken by Wallenstein in the Thirty Years ' War , but he was more than satisfied with the execution of the work , which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it as Pincini 's masterpiece . '' This story , THE BACKGROUND , and MRS PACKLETIDE 'S TIGER seem to me to be the masterpieces of this book . In both of them Clovis exercises , needlessly , his titular right of entry , but he can be removed without damage , leaving Saki at his best and most characteristic , save that he shows here , in addition to his own shining qualities , a compactness and a finish which he did not always achieve . With these I introduce you to him , confident that ten minutes of his conversation , more surely than any words of mine , will have given him the freedom of your house . A . A. MILNE .

I was n't living apart from my husband then ; you see , neither of us could afford to make the other a separate allowance . In spite of everything that proverbs may say , poverty keeps together more homes than it breaks up . But we always hunted with different packs . All this has nothing to do with the story . '' `` We have n't arrived at the meet yet . I suppose there was a meet , '' said Clovis . `` Of course there was a meet , '' said the Baroness ; all the usual crowd were there , especially Constance Broddle . Constance is one of those strapping florid girls that go so well with autumn scenery or Christmas decorations in church . ' I feel a presentiment that something dreadful is going to happen , ' she said to me ; 'am I looking pale ? ' `` She was looking about as pale as a beetroot that has suddenly heard bad news . `` 'You 're looking nicer than usual , ' I said , 'but that 's so easy for you . ' Before she had got the right bearings of this remark we had settled down to business ; hounds had found a fox lying out in some gorse-bushes . '' `` I knew it , '' said Clovis , `` in every fox-hunting story that I 've ever heard there 's been a fox and some gorse-bushes . '' `` Constance and I were well mounted , '' continued the Baroness serenely , '' and we had no difficulty in keeping ourselves in the first flight , though it was a fairly stiff run . Towards the finish , however , we must have held rather too independent a line , for we lost the hounds , and found ourselves plodding aimlessly along miles away from anywhere . It was fairly exasperating , and my temper was beginning to let itself go by inches , when on pushing our way through an accommodating hedge we were gladdened by the sight of hounds in full cry in a hollow just beneath us . `` 'There they go , ' cried Constance , and then added in a gasp , 'In Heaven 's name , what are they hunting ? ' `` It was certainly no mortal fox . It stood more than twice as high , had a short , ugly head , and an enormous thick neck . `` 'It 's a hyaena , ' I cried ; 'it must have escaped from Lord Pabham's Park . ' `` At that moment the hunted beast turned and faced its pursuers , and the hounds ( there were only about six couple of them ) stood round in a half-circle and looked foolish . Evidently they had broken away from the rest of the pack on the trail of this alien scent , and were not quite sure how to treat their quarry now they had got him . `` The hyaena hailed our approach with unmistakable relief and demonstrations of friendliness . It had probably been accustomed to uniform kindness from humans , while its first experience of a pack of hounds had left a bad impression . The hounds looked more than ever embarrassed as their quarry paraded its sudden intimacy with us , and the faint toot of a horn in the distance was seized on as a welcome signal for unobtrusive departure . Constance and I and the hyaena were left alone in the gathering twilight . `` 'What are we to do ? ' asked Constance . `` 'What a person you are for questions , ' I said . `` 'Well , we ca n't stay here all night with a hyaena , ' she retorted . `` ' I do n't know what your ideas of comfort are , ' I said ; 'but I should n't think of staying here all night even without a hyaena . My home may be an unhappy one , but at least it has hot and cold water laid on , and domestic service , and other conveniences which we shouldn't find here . We had better make for that ridge of trees to the right ; I imagine the Crowley road is just beyond . ' `` We trotted off slowly along a faintly marked cart-track , with the beast following cheerfully at our heels . `` 'What on earth are we to do with the hyaena ? ' came the inevitable question . `` 'What does one generally do with hyaenas ? ' I asked crossly . `` ' I 've never had anything to do with one before , ' said Constance . `` 'Well , neither have I . If we even knew its sex we might give it a name . Perhaps we might call it Esmé . That would do in either case . ' `` There was still sufficient daylight for us to distinguish wayside objects , and our listless spirits gave an upward perk as we came upon a small half-naked gipsy brat picking blackberries from a low-growing bush . The sudden apparition of two horsewomen and a hyaena set it off crying , and in any case we should scarcely have gleaned any useful geographical information from that source ; but there was a probability that we might strike a gipsy encampment somewhere along our route . We rode on hopefully but uneventfully for another mile or so . `` ' I wonder what that child was doing there , ' said Constance presently . `` 'Picking blackberries . Obviously . ' `` ' I do n't like the way it cried , ' pursued Constance ; 'somehow its wail keeps ringing in my ears . ' `` I did not chide Constance for her morbid fancies ; as a matter of fact the same sensation , of being pursued by a persistent fretful wail , had been forcing itself on my rather over-tired nerves . For company 's sake I hulloed to Esmé , who had lagged somewhat behind . With a few springy bounds he drew up level , and then shot past us . `` The wailing accompaniment was explained . The gipsy child was firmly , and I expect painfully , held in his jaws . `` 'Merciful Heaven ! ' screamed Constance , 'what on earth shall we do ? What are we to do ? ' `` I am perfectly certain that at the Last Judgment Constance will ask more questions than any of the examining Seraphs . `` 'Ca n't we do something ? ' she persisted tearfully , as Esmé cantered easily along in front of our tired horses . `` Personally I was doing everything that occurred to me at the moment . I stormed and scolded and coaxed in English and French and gamekeeper language ; I made absurd , ineffectual cuts in the air with my thongless hunting-crop ; I hurled my sandwich case at the brute ; in fact , I really do n't know what more I could have done . And still we lumbered on through the deepening dusk , with that dark uncouth shape lumbering ahead of us , and a drone of lugubrious music floating in our ears . Suddenly Esmé bounded aside into some thick bushes , where we could not follow ; the wail rose to a shriek and then stopped altogether . This part of the story I always hurry over , because it is really rather horrible . When the beast joined us again , after an absence of a few minutes , there was an air of patient understanding about him , as though he knew that he had done something of which we disapproved , but which he felt to be thoroughly justifiable . `` 'How can you let that ravening beast trot by your side ? ' asked Constance . She was looking more than ever like an albino beetroot . `` 'In the first place , I ca n't prevent it , ' I said ; 'and in the second place , whatever else he may be , I doubt if he 's ravening at the present moment . ' `` Constance shuddered . 'Do you think the poor little thing suffered much ? ' came another of her futile questions . `` 'The indications were all that way , ' I said ; 'on the other hand , of course , it may have been crying from sheer temper . Children sometimes do . ' `` It was nearly pitch-dark when we emerged suddenly into the highroad . A flash of lights and the whir of a motor went past us at the same moment at uncomfortably close quarters . A thud and a sharp screeching yell followed a second later . The car drew up , and when I had ridden back to the spot I found a young man bending over a dark motionless mass lying by the roadside . `` 'You have killed my Esmé , ' I exclaimed bitterly . `` ' I 'm so awfully sorry , ' said the young man ; I keep dogs myself , so I know what you must feel about it . I 'll do anything I can in reparation . ' `` 'Please bury him at once , ' I said ; 'that much I think I may ask of you . ' `` 'Bring the spade , William , ' he called to the chauffeur . Evidently hasty roadside interments were contingencies that had been provided against . `` The digging of a sufficiently large grave took some little time . ' I say , what a magnificent fellow , ' said the motorist as the corpse was rolled over into the trench . ' I 'm afraid he must have been rather a valuable animal . ' `` 'He took second in the puppy class at Birmingham last year , ' I said resolutely . `` Constance snorted loudly . `` 'Do n't cry , dear , ' I said brokenly ; 'it was all over in a moment . He could n't have suffered much . ' `` 'Look here , ' said the young fellow desperately , 'you simply must let me do something by way of reparation . ' `` I refused sweetly , but as he persisted I let him have my address . `` Of course , we kept our own counsel as to the earlier episodes of the evening . Lord Pabham never advertised the loss of his hyaena ; when a strictly fruit-eating animal strayed from his park a year or two previously he was called upon to give compensation in eleven cases of sheep-worrying and practically to re-stock his neighbours' poultry-yards , and an escaped hyaena would have mounted up to something on the scale of a Government grant . The gipsies were equally unobtrusive over their missing offspring ; I do n't suppose in large encampments they really know to a child or two how many they 've got . '' The Baroness paused reflectively , and then continued : '' There was a sequel to the adventure , though . I got through the post a charming little diamond brooch , with the name Esmé set in a sprig of rosemary . Incidentally , too , I lost the friendship of Constance Broddle . You see , when I sold the brooch I quite properly refused to give her any share of the proceeds . I pointed out that the Esmé part of the affair was my own invention , and the hyaena part of it belonged to Lord Pabham , if it really was his hyaena , of which , of course , I've no proof . '' THE MATCH-MAKER The grill-room clock struck eleven with the respectful unobtrusiveness of one whose mission in life is to be ignored . When the flight of time should really have rendered abstinence and migration imperative the lighting apparatus would signal the fact in the usual way . Six minutes later Clovis approached the supper-table , in the blessed expectancy of one who has dined sketchily and long ago . `` I 'm starving , '' he announced , making an effort to sit down gracefully and read the menu at the same time . `` So I gathered ; '' said his host , `` from the fact that you were nearly punctual . I ought to have told you that I 'm a Food Reformer . I've ordered two bowls of bread-and-milk and some health biscuits . I hope you do n't mind . '' Clovis pretended afterwards that he did n't go white above the collar-line for the fraction of a second . `` All the same , '' he said , `` you ought not to joke about such things . There really are such people . I 've known people who 've met them . To think of all the adorable things there are to eat in the world , and then to go through life munching sawdust and being proud of it . '' `` They 're like the Flagellants of the Middle Ages , who went about mortifying themselves . '' `` They had some excuse , '' said Clovis . `` They did it to save their immortal souls , did n't they ? You need n't tell me that a man who does n't love oysters and asparagus and good wines has got a soul , or a stomach either . He 's simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly developed . '' Clovis relapsed for a few golden moments into tender intimacies with a succession of rapidly disappearing oysters . `` I think oysters are more beautiful than any religion , '' he resumed presently . `` They not only forgive our unkindness to them ; they justify it , they incite us to go on being perfectly horrid to them . Once they arrive at the supper-table they seem to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the thing . There 's nothing in Christianity or Buddhism that quite matches the sympathetic unselfishness of an oyster . Do you like my new waistcoat ? I 'm wearing it for the first time to-night . '' `` It looks like a great many others you 've had lately , only worse . New dinner waistcoats are becoming a habit with you . '' `` They say one always pays for the excesses of one 's youth ; mercifully that is n't true about one 's clothes . My mother is thinking of getting married . '' `` Again ! '' `` It 's the first time . '' `` Of course , you ought to know . I was under the impression that she'd been married once or twice at least . '' `` Three times , to be mathematically exact . I meant that it was the first time she 'd thought about getting married ; the other times she did it without thinking . As a matter of fact , it 's really I who am doing the thinking for her in this case . You see , it 's quite two years since her last husband died . '' `` You evidently think that brevity is the soul of widowhood . '' `` Well , it struck me that she was getting moped , and beginning to settle down , which would n't suit her a bit . The first symptom that I noticed was when she began to complain that we were living beyond our income . All decent people live beyond their incomes nowadays , and those who are n't respectable live beyond other peoples . A few gifted individuals manage to do both . '' `` It 's hardly so much a gift as an industry . '' `` The crisis came , '' returned Clovis , `` when she suddenly started the theory that late hours were bad for one , and wanted me to be in by one o'clock every night . Imagine that sort of thing for me , who was eighteen on my last birthday . '' `` On your last two birthdays , to be mathematically exact . '' `` Oh , well , that 's not my fault . I 'm not going to arrive at nineteen as long as my mother remains at thirty-seven . One must have some regard for appearances . '' `` Perhaps your mother would age a little in the process of settling down . '' `` That 's the last thing she 'd think of . Feminine reformations always start in on the failings of other people . That 's why I was so keen on the husband idea . '' `` Did you go as far as to select the gentleman , or did you merely throw out a general idea , and trust to the force of suggestion ? '' `` If one wants a thing done in a hurry one must see to it oneself . I found a military Johnny hanging round on a loose end at the club , and took him home to lunch once or twice . He 'd spent most of his life on the Indian frontier , building roads , and relieving famines and minimizing earthquakes , and all that sort of thing that one does do on frontiers . He could talk sense to a peevish cobra in fifteen native languages , and probably knew what to do if you found a rogue elephant on your croquet-lawn ; but he was shy and diffident with women . I told my mother privately that he was an absolute woman-hater ; so , of course , she laid herself out to flirt all she knew , which is n't a little . '' `` And was the gentleman responsive ? '' `` I hear he told some one at the club that he was looking out for a Colonial job , with plenty of hard work , for a young friend of his , so I gather that he has some idea of marrying into the family . '' `` You seem destined to be the victim of the reformation , after all . '' Clovis wiped the trace of Turkish coffee and the beginnings of a smile from his lips , and slowly lowered his dexter eyelid . Which , being interpreted , probably meant , `` I DO N'T think ! '' TOBERMORY It was a chill , rain-washed afternoon of a late August day , that indefinite season when partridges are still in security or cold storage , and there is nothing to hunt -- unless one is bounded on the north by the Bristol Channel , in which case one may lawfully gallop after fat red stags . Lady Blemley 's house-party was not bounded on the north by the Bristol Channel , hence there was a full gathering of her guests round the tea-table on this particular afternoon . And , in spite of the blankness of the season and the triteness of the occasion , there was no trace in the company of that fatigued restlessness which means a dread of the pianola and a subdued hankering for auction bridge . The undisguised openmouthed attention of the entire party was fixed on the homely negative personality of Mr. Cornelius Appin . Of all her guests , he was the one who had come to Lady Blemley with the vaguest reputation . Some one had said he was `` clever , '' and he had got his invitation in the moderate expectation , on the part of his hostess , that some portion at least of his cleverness would be contributed to the general entertainment . Until tea-time that day she had been unable to discover in what direction , if any , his cleverness lay . He was neither a wit nor a croquet champion , a hypnotic force nor a begetter of amateur theatricals . Neither did his exterior suggest the sort of man in whom women are willing to pardon a generous measure of mental deficiency . He had subsided into mere Mr. Appin , and the Cornelius seemed a piece of transparent baptismal bluff . And now he was claiming to have launched on the world a discovery beside which the invention of gunpowder , of the printing-press , and of steam locomotion were inconsiderable trifles . Science had made bewildering strides in many directions during recent decades , but this thing seemed to belong to the domain of miracle rather than to scientific achievement . ``",The Chronicles Of Clovis
Joseph Conrad,"I don ’ t mean to say that I became then conscious of any impending change in my mentality and in my attitude towards the tasks of my writing life . And perhaps there was never any change , except in that mysterious , extraneous thing which has nothing to do with the theories of art ; a subtle change in the nature of the inspiration ; a phenomenon for which I can not in any way be held responsible . What , however , did cause me some concern was that after finishing the last story of the “ Typhoon ” volume it seemed somehow that there was nothing more in the world to write about . This so strangely negative but disturbing mood lasted some little time ; and then , as with many of my longer stories , the first hint for “ Nostromo ” came to me in the shape of a vagrant anecdote completely destitute of valuable details . As a matter of fact in 1875 or ‘ 6 , when very young , in the West Indies or rather in the Gulf of Mexico , for my contacts with land were short , few , and fleeting , I heard the story of some man who was supposed to have stolen single-handed a whole lighter-full of silver , somewhere on the Tierra Firme seaboard during the troubles of a revolution . On the face of it this was something of a feat . But I heard no details , and having no particular interest in crime qua crime I was not likely to keep that one in my mind . And I forgot it till twenty-six or seven years afterwards I came upon the very thing in a shabby volume picked up outside a second-hand book-shop . It was the life story of an American seaman written by himself with the assistance of a journalist . In the course of his wanderings that American sailor worked for some months on board a schooner , the master and owner of which was the thief of whom I had heard in my very young days . I have no doubt of that because there could hardly have been two exploits of that peculiar kind in the same part of the world and both connected with a South American revolution . The fellow had actually managed to steal a lighter with silver , and this , it seems , only because he was implicitly trusted by his employers , who must have been singularly poor judges of character . In the sailor ’ s story he is represented as an unmitigated rascal , a small cheat , stupidly ferocious , morose , of mean appearance , and altogether unworthy of the greatness this opportunity had thrust upon him . What was interesting was that he would boast of it openly . He used to say : “ People think I make a lot of money in this schooner of mine . But that is nothing . I don ’ t care for that . Now and then I go away quietly and lift a bar of silver . I must get rich slowly -- you understand. ” There was also another curious point about the man . Once in the course of some quarrel the sailor threatened him : “ What ’ s to prevent me reporting ashore what you have told me about that silver ? ” The cynical ruffian was not alarmed in the least . He actually laughed . “ You fool , if you dare talk like that on shore about me you will get a knife stuck in your back . Every man , woman , and child in that port is my friend . And who ’ s to prove the lighter wasn ’ t sunk ? I didn ’ t show you where the silver is hidden . Did I ? So you know nothing . And suppose I lied ? Eh ? ” Ultimately the sailor , disgusted with the sordid meanness of that impenitent thief , deserted from the schooner . The whole episode takes about three pages of his autobiography . Nothing to speak of ; but as I looked them over , the curious confirmation of the few casual words heard in my early youth evoked the memories of that distant time when everything was so fresh , so surprising , so venturesome , so interesting ; bits of strange coasts under the stars , shadows of hills in the sunshine , men ’ s passions in the dusk , gossip half-forgotten , faces grown dim . . . . Perhaps , perhaps , there still was in the world something to write about . Yet I did not see anything at first in the mere story . A rascal steals a large parcel of a valuable commodity -- so people say . It ’ s either true or untrue ; and in any case it has no value in itself . To invent a circumstantial account of the robbery did not appeal to me , because my talents not running that way I did not think that the game was worth the candle . It was only when it dawned upon me that the purloiner of the treasure need not necessarily be a confirmed rogue , that he could be even a man of character , an actor and possibly a victim in the changing scenes of a revolution , it was only then that I had the first vision of a twilight country which was to become the province of Sulaco , with its high shadowy Sierra and its misty Campo for mute witnesses of events flowing from the passions of men short-sighted in good and evil . Such are in very truth the obscure origins of “ Nostromo ” -- the book . From that moment , I suppose , it had to be . Yet even then I hesitated , as if warned by the instinct of self-preservation from venturing on a distant and toilsome journey into a land full of intrigues and revolutions . But it had to be done . It took the best part of the years 1903-4 to do ; with many intervals of renewed hesitation , lest I should lose myself in the ever-enlarging vistas opening before me as I progressed deeper in my knowledge of the country . Often , also , when I had thought myself to a standstill over the tangled-up affairs of the Republic , I would , figuratively speaking , pack my bag , rush away from Sulaco for a change of air and write a few pages of the “ Mirror of the Sea. ” But generally , as I ’ ve said before , my sojourn on the Continent of Latin America , famed for its hospitality , lasted for about two years . On my return I found ( speaking somewhat in the style of Captain Gulliver ) my family all well , my wife heartily glad to learn that the fuss was all over , and our small boy considerably grown during my absence . My principal authority for the history of Costaguana is , of course , my venerated friend , the late Don Jose Avellanos , Minister to the Courts of England and Spain , etc. , etc. , in his impartial and eloquent “ History of Fifty Years of Misrule. ” That work was never published -- the reader will discover why -- and I am in fact the only person in the world possessed of its contents . I have mastered them in not a few hours of earnest meditation , and I hope that my accuracy will be trusted . In justice to myself , and to allay the fears of prospective readers , I beg to point out that the few historical allusions are never dragged in for the sake of parading my unique erudition , but that each of them is closely related to actuality ; either throwing a light on the nature of current events or affecting directly the fortunes of the people of whom I speak . As to their own histories I have tried to set them down , Aristocracy and People , men and women , Latin and Anglo-Saxon , bandit and politician , with as cool a hand as was possible in the heat and clash of my own conflicting emotions . And after all this is also the story of their conflicts . It is for the reader to say how far they are deserving of interest in their actions and in the secret purposes of their hearts revealed in the bitter necessities of the time . I confess that , for me , that time is the time of firm friendships and unforgotten hospitalities . And in my gratitude I must mention here Mrs. Gould , “ the first lady of Sulaco , ” whom we may safely leave to the secret devotion of Dr. Monygham , and Charles Gould , the Idealist-creator of Material Interests whom we must leave to his Mine -- from which there is no escape in this world . About Nostromo , the second of the two racially and socially contrasted men , both captured by the silver of the San Tome Mine , I feel bound to say something more . I did not hesitate to make that central figure an Italian . First of all the thing is perfectly credible : Italians were swarming into the Occidental Province at the time , as anybody who will read further can see ; and secondly , there was no one who could stand so well by the side of Giorgio Viola the Garibaldino , the Idealist of the old , humanitarian revolutions . For myself I needed there a Man of the People as free as possible from his class-conventions and all settled modes of thinking . This is not a side snarl at conventions . My reasons were not moral but artistic . Had he been an Anglo-Saxon he would have tried to get into local politics . But Nostromo does not aspire to be a leader in a personal game . He does not want to raise himself above the mass . He is content to feel himself a power -- within the People . But mainly Nostromo is what he is because I received the inspiration for him in my early days from a Mediterranean sailor . Those who have read certain pages of mine will see at once what I mean when I say that Dominic , the padrone of the Tremolino , might under given circumstances have been a Nostromo . At any rate Dominic would have understood the younger man perfectly -- if scornfully . He and I were engaged together in a rather absurd adventure , but the absurdity does not matter . It is a real satisfaction to think that in my very young days there must , after all , have been something in me worthy to command that man ’ s half-bitter fidelity , his half-ironic devotion . Many of Nostromo ’ s speeches I have heard first in Dominic ’ s voice . His hand on the tiller and his fearless eyes roaming the horizon from within the monkish hood shadowing his face , he would utter the usual exordium of his remorseless wisdom : “ _Vous autres gentilhommes ! _ ” in a caustic tone that hangs on my ear yet . Like Nostromo ! “ You _hombres finos ! _ ” Very much like Nostromo . But Dominic the Corsican nursed a certain pride of ancestry from which my Nostromo is free ; for Nostromo ’ s lineage had to be more ancient still . He is a man with the weight of countless generations behind him and no parentage to boast of . . . . Like the People . In his firm grip on the earth he inherits , in his improvidence and generosity , in his lavishness with his gifts , in his manly vanity , in the obscure sense of his greatness and in his faithful devotion with something despairing as well as desperate in its impulses , he is a Man of the People , their very own unenvious force , disdaining to lead but ruling from within . Years afterwards , grown older as the famous Captain Fidanza , with a stake in the country , going about his many affairs followed by respectful glances in the modernized streets of Sulaco , calling on the widow of the cargador , attending the Lodge , listening in unmoved silence to anarchist speeches at the meeting , the enigmatical patron of the new revolutionary agitation , the trusted , the wealthy comrade Fidanza with the knowledge of his moral ruin locked up in his breast , he remains essentially a Man of the People . In his mingled love and scorn of life and in the bewildered conviction of having been betrayed , of dying betrayed he hardly knows by what or by whom , he is still of the People , their undoubted Great Man -- with a private history of his own . One more figure of those stirring times I would like to mention : and that is Antonia Avellanos -- the “ beautiful Antonia. ” Whether she is a possible variation of Latin-American girlhood I wouldn ’ t dare to affirm . But , for me , she is . Always a little in the background by the side of her father ( my venerated friend ) I hope she has yet relief enough to make intelligible what I am going to say . Of all the people who had seen with me the birth of the Occidental Republic , she is the only one who has kept in my memory the aspect of continued life . Antonia the Aristocrat and Nostromo the Man of the People are the artisans of the New Era , the true creators of the New State ; he by his legendary and daring feat , she , like a woman , simply by the force of what she is : the only being capable of inspiring a sincere passion in the heart of a trifler . If anything could induce me to revisit Sulaco ( I should hate to see all these changes ) it would be Antonia . And the true reason for that -- why not be frank about it ? -- the true reason is that I have modelled her on my first love . How we , a band of tallish schoolboys , the chums of her two brothers , how we used to look up to that girl just out of the schoolroom herself , as the standard-bearer of a faith to which we all were born but which she alone knew how to hold aloft with an unflinching hope ! She had perhaps more glow and less serenity in her soul than Antonia , but she was an uncompromising Puritan of patriotism with no taint of the slightest worldliness in her thoughts . I was not the only one in love with her ; but it was I who had to hear oftenest her scathing criticism of my levities -- very much like poor Decoud -- or stand the brunt of her austere , unanswerable invective . She did not quite understand -- but never mind . That afternoon when I came in , a shrinking yet defiant sinner , to say the final good-bye I received a hand-squeeze that made my heart leap and saw a tear that took my breath away . She was softened at the last as though she had suddenly perceived ( we were such children still ! ) that I was really going away for good , going very far away -- even as far as Sulaco , lying unknown , hidden from our eyes in the darkness of the Placid Gulf . That ’ s why I long sometimes for another glimpse of the “ beautiful Antonia ” ( or can it be the Other ? ) moving in the dimness of the great cathedral , saying a short prayer at the tomb of the first and last Cardinal-Archbishop of Sulaco , standing absorbed in filial devotion before the monument of Don Jose Avellanos , and , with a lingering , tender , faithful glance at the medallion-memorial to Martin Decoud , going out serenely into the sunshine of the Plaza with her upright carriage and her white head ; a relic of the past disregarded by men awaiting impatiently the Dawns of other New Eras , the coming of more Revolutions . But this is the idlest of dreams ; for I did understand perfectly well at the time that the moment the breath left the body of the Magnificent Capataz , the Man of the People , freed at last from the toils of love and wealth , there was nothing more for me to do in Sulaco . J. C. October , 1917 . CONTENTS PART FIRST THE SILVER OF THE MINE PART SECOND THE ISABELS PART THIRD THE LIGHTHOUSE NOSTROMO PART FIRST THE SILVER OF THE MINE CHAPTER ONE In the time of Spanish rule , and for many years afterwards , the town of Sulaco -- the luxuriant beauty of the orange gardens bears witness to its antiquity -- had never been commercially anything more important than a coasting port with a fairly large local trade in ox-hides and indigo . The clumsy deep-sea galleons of the conquerors that , needing a brisk gale to move at all , would lie becalmed , where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead by the mere flapping of her sails , had been barred out of Sulaco by the prevailing calms of its vast gulf . Some harbours of the earth are made difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their shores . Sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a trading world in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within an enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean , with its walls of lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud . On one side of this broad curve in the straight seaboard of the Republic of Costaguana , the last spur of the coast range forms an insignificant cape whose name is Punta Mala . From the middle of the gulf the point of the land itself is not visible at all ; but the shoulder of a steep hill at the back can be made out faintly like a shadow on the sky . On the other side , what seems to be an isolated patch of blue mist floats lightly on the glare of the horizon . This is the peninsula of Azuera , a wild chaos of sharp rocks and stony levels cut about by vertical ravines . It lies far out to sea like a rough head of stone stretched from a green-clad coast at the end of a slender neck of sand covered with thickets of thorny scrub . Utterly waterless , for the rainfall runs off at once on all sides into the sea , it has not soil enough -- it is said -- to grow a single blade of grass , as if it were blighted by a curse . The poor , associating by an obscure instinct of consolation the ideas of evil and wealth , will tell you that it is deadly because of its forbidden treasures . The common folk of the neighbourhood , peons of the estancias , vaqueros of the seaboard plains , tame Indians coming miles to market with a bundle of sugar-cane or a basket of maize worth about threepence , are well aware that heaps of shining gold lie in the gloom of the deep precipices cleaving the stony levels of Azuera . Tradition has it that many adventurers of olden time had perished in the search . The story goes also that within men ’ s memory two wandering sailors -- Americanos , perhaps , but gringos of some sort for certain -- talked over a gambling , good-for-nothing mozo , and the three stole a donkey to carry for them a bundle of dry sticks , a water-skin , and provisions enough to last a few days . Thus accompanied , and with revolvers at their belts , they had started to chop their way with machetes through the thorny scrub on the neck of the peninsula . On the second evening an upright spiral of smoke ( it could only have been from their camp-fire ) was seen for the first time within memory of man standing up faintly upon the sky above a razor-backed ridge on the stony head . The crew of a coasting schooner , lying becalmed three miles off the shore , stared at it with amazement till dark . A negro fisherman , living in a lonely hut in a little bay near by , had seen the start and was on the lookout for some sign . He called to his wife just as the sun was about to set . They had watched the strange portent with envy , incredulity , and awe . The impious adventurers gave no other sign . The sailors , the Indian , and the stolen burro were never seen again . As to the mozo , a Sulaco man -- his wife paid for some masses , and the poor four-footed beast , being without sin , had been probably permitted to die ; but the two gringos , spectral and alive , are believed to be dwelling to this day amongst the rocks , under the fatal spell of their success . Their souls can not tear themselves away from their bodies mounting guard over the discovered treasure . They are now rich and hungry and thirsty -- a strange theory of tenacious gringo ghosts suffering in their starved and parched flesh of defiant heretics , where a Christian would have renounced and been released . These , then , are the legendary inhabitants of Azuera guarding its forbidden wealth ; and the shadow on the sky on one side with the round patch of blue haze blurring the bright skirt of the horizon on the other , mark the two outermost points of the bend which bears the name of Golfo Placido , because never a strong wind had been known to blow upon its waters . On crossing the imaginary line drawn from Punta Mala to Azuera the ships from Europe bound to Sulaco lose at once the strong breezes of the ocean . They become the prey of capricious airs that play with them for thirty hours at a stretch sometimes . Before them the head of the calm gulf is filled on most days of the year by a great body of motionless and opaque clouds . On the rare clear mornings another shadow is cast upon the sweep of the gulf . The dawn breaks high behind the towering and serrated wall of the Cordillera , a clear-cut vision of dark peaks rearing their steep slopes on a lofty pedestal of forest rising from the very edge of the shore . Amongst them the white head of Higuerota rises majestically upon the blue . Bare clusters of enormous rocks sprinkle with tiny black dots the smooth dome of snow . Then , as the midday sun withdraws from the gulf the shadow of the mountains , the clouds begin to roll out of the lower valleys . They swathe in sombre tatters the naked crags of precipices above the wooded slopes , hide the peaks , smoke in stormy trails across the snows of Higuerota . The Cordillera is gone from you as if it had dissolved itself into great piles of grey and black vapours that travel out slowly to seaward and vanish into thin air all along the front before the blazing heat of the day . The wasting edge of the cloud-bank always strives for , but seldom wins , the middle of the gulf . The sun -- as the sailors say -- is eating it up . Unless perchance a sombre thunder-head breaks away from the main body to career all over the gulf till it escapes into the offing beyond Azuera , where it bursts suddenly into flame and crashes like a sinster pirate-ship of the air , hove-to above the horizon , engaging the sea . At night the body of clouds advancing higher up the sky smothers the whole quiet gulf below with an impenetrable darkness , in which the sound of the falling showers can be heard beginning and ceasing abruptly -- now here , now there . Indeed , these cloudy nights are proverbial with the seamen along the whole west coast of a great continent . Sky , land , and sea disappear together out of the world when the Placido -- as the saying is -- goes to sleep under its black poncho . The few stars left below the seaward frown of the vault shine feebly as into the mouth of a black cavern . In its vastness your ship floats unseen under your feet , her sails flutter invisible above your head . The eye of God Himself -- they add with grim profanity -- could not find out what work a man ’ s hand is doing in there ; and you would be free to call the devil to your aid with impunity if even his malice were not defeated by such a blind darkness . The shores on the gulf are steep-to all round ; three uninhabited islets basking in the sunshine just outside the cloud veil , and opposite the entrance to the harbour of Sulaco , bear the name of “ The Isabels. ” There is the Great Isabel ; the Little Isabel , which is round ; and Hermosa , which is the smallest . That last is no more than a foot high , and about seven paces across , a mere flat top of a grey rock which smokes like a hot cinder after a shower , and where no man would care to venture a naked sole before sunset . On the Little Isabel an old ragged palm , with a thick bulging trunk rough with spines , a very witch amongst palm trees , rustles a dismal bunch of dead leaves above the coarse sand . The Great Isabel has a spring of fresh water issuing from the overgrown side of a ravine . Resembling an emerald green wedge of land a mile long , and laid flat upon the sea , it bears two forest trees standing close together , with a wide spread of shade at the foot of their smooth trunks . A ravine extending the whole length of the island is full of bushes ; and presenting a deep tangled cleft on the high side spreads itself out on the other into a shallow depression abutting on a small strip of sandy shore . From that low end of the Great Isabel the eye plunges through an opening two miles away , as abrupt as if chopped with an axe out of the regular sweep of the coast , right into the harbour of Sulaco . It is an oblong , lake-like piece of water . On one side the short wooded spurs and valleys of the Cordillera come down at right angles to the very strand ; on the other the open view of the great Sulaco plain passes into the opal mystery of great distances overhung by dry haze . The town of Sulaco itself -- tops of walls , a great cupola , gleams of white miradors in a vast grove of orange trees -- lies between the mountains and the plain , at some little distance from its harbour and out of the direct line of sight from the sea . CHAPTER TWO The only sign of commercial activity within the harbour , visible from the beach of the Great Isabel , is the square blunt end of the wooden jetty which the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company ( the O.S.N . of familiar speech ) had thrown over the shallow part of the bay soon after they had resolved to make of Sulaco one of their ports of call for the Republic of Costaguana . The State possesses several harbours on its long seaboard , but except Cayta , an important place , all are either small and inconvenient inlets in an iron-bound coast -- like Esmeralda , for instance , sixty miles to the south -- or else mere open roadsteads exposed to the winds and fretted by the surf . Perhaps the very atmospheric conditions which had kept away the merchant fleets of bygone ages induced the O.S.N . Company to violate the sanctuary of peace sheltering the calm existence of Sulaco . The variable airs sporting lightly with the vast semicircle of waters within the head of Azuera could not baffle the steam power of their excellent fleet . Year after year the black hulls of their ships had gone up and down the coast , in and out , past Azuera , past the Isabels , past Punta Mala -- disregarding everything but the tyranny of time . Their names , the names of all mythology , became the household words of a coast that had never been ruled by the gods of Olympus . The Juno was known only for her comfortable cabins amidships , the Saturn for the geniality of her captain and the painted and gilt luxuriousness of her saloon , whereas the Ganymede was fitted out mainly for cattle transport , and to be avoided by coastwise passengers . The humblest Indian in the obscurest village on the coast was familiar with the Cerberus , a little black puffer without charm or living accommodation to speak of , whose mission was to creep inshore along the wooded beaches close to mighty ugly rocks , stopping obligingly before every cluster of huts to collect produce , down to three-pound parcels of indiarubber bound in a wrapper of dry grass . And as they seldom failed to account for the smallest package , rarely lost a bullock , and had never drowned a single passenger , the name of the O.S.N . stood very high for trustworthiness . People declared that under the Company ’ s care their lives and property were safer on the water than in their own houses on shore . The O.S.N. ’ s superintendent in Sulaco for the whole Costaguana section of the service was very proud of his Company ’ s standing . He resumed it in a saying which was very often on his lips , “ We never make mistakes. ” To the Company ’ s officers it took the form of a severe injunction , “ We must make no mistakes . I ’ ll have no mistakes here , no matter what Smith may do at his end. ” Smith , on whom he had never set eyes in his life , was the other superintendent of the service , quartered some fifteen hundred miles away from Sulaco . “ Don ’ t talk to me of your Smith. ” Then , calming down suddenly , he would dismiss the subject with studied negligence . Amongst these last he accounted as most unfavourable to the orderly working of his Company the frequent changes of government brought about by revolutions of the military type . The political atmosphere of the Republic was generally stormy in these days . The fugitive patriots of the defeated party had the knack of turning up again on the coast with half a steamer ’ s load of small arms and ammunition . Such resourcefulness Captain Mitchell considered as perfectly wonderful in view of their utter destitution at the time of flight . He had observed that “ they never seemed to have enough change about them to pay for their passage ticket out of the country. ” And he could speak with knowledge ; for on a memorable occasion he had been called upon to save the life of a dictator , together with the lives of a few Sulaco officials -- the political chief , the director of the customs , and the head of police -- belonging to an overturned government . Poor Senor Ribiera ( such was the dictator ’ s name ) had come pelting eighty miles over mountain tracks after the lost battle of Socorro , in the hope of out-distancing the fatal news -- which , of course , he could not manage to do on a lame mule . The animal , moreover , expired under him at the end of the Alameda , where the military band plays sometimes in the evenings between the revolutions . “ Sir , ” Captain Mitchell would pursue with portentous gravity , “ the ill-timed end of that mule attracted attention to the unfortunate rider . His features were recognized by several deserters from the Dictatorial army amongst the rascally mob already engaged in smashing the windows of the Intendencia. ” Early on the morning of that day the local authorities of Sulaco had fled for refuge to the O.S.N . Company ’ s offices , a strong building near the shore end of the jetty , leaving the town to the mercies of a revolutionary rabble ; and as the Dictator was execrated by the populace on account of the severe recruitment law his necessities had compelled him to enforce during the struggle , he stood a good chance of being torn to pieces . Providentially , Nostromo -- invaluable fellow -- with some Italian workmen , imported to work upon the National Central Railway , was at hand , and managed to snatch him away -- for the time at least . Ultimately , Captain Mitchell succeeded in taking everybody off in his own gig to one of the Company ’ s steamers -- it was the Minerva -- just then , as luck would have it , entering the harbour . He had to lower these gentlemen at the end of a rope out of a hole in the wall at the back , while the mob which , pouring out of the town , had spread itself all along the shore , howled and foamed at the foot of the building in front . He had to hurry them then the whole length of the jetty ; it had been a desperate dash , neck or nothing -- and again it was Nostromo , a fellow in a thousand , who , at the head , this time , of the Company ’ s body of lightermen , held the jetty against the rushes of the rabble , thus giving the fugitives time to reach the gig lying ready for them at the other end with the Company ’ s flag at the stern . Sticks , stones , shots flew ; knives , too , were thrown . Captain Mitchell exhibited willingly the long cicatrice of a cut over his left ear and temple , made by a razor-blade fastened to a stick -- a weapon , he explained , very much in favour with the “ worst kind of nigger out here. ” Captain Mitchell was a thick , elderly man , wearing high , pointed collars and short side-whiskers , partial to white waistcoats , and really very communicative under his air of pompous reserve . “ These gentlemen , ” he would say , staring with great solemnity , “ had to run like rabbits , sir . I ran like a rabbit myself . Certain forms of death are -- er -- distasteful to a -- a -- er -- respectable man . They would have pounded me to death , too . A crazy mob , sir , does not discriminate . Under providence we owed our preservation to my Capataz de Cargadores , as they called him in the town , a man who , when I discovered his value , sir , was just the bos ’ n of an Italian ship , a big Genoese ship , one of the few European ships that ever came to Sulaco with a general cargo before the building of the National Central . He left her on account of some very respectable friends he made here , his own countrymen , but also , I suppose , to better himself . Sir , I am a pretty good judge of character . I engaged him to be the foreman of our lightermen , and caretaker of our jetty . That ’ s all that he was . But without him Senor Ribiera would have been a dead man . This Nostromo , sir , a man absolutely above reproach , became the terror of all the thieves in the town . We were infested , infested , overrun , sir , here at that time by ladrones and matreros , thieves and murderers from the whole province . On this occasion they had been flocking into Sulaco for a week past . They had scented the end , sir . Fifty per cent . of that murdering mob were professional bandits from the Campo , sir , but there wasn ’ t one that hadn ’ t heard of Nostromo . As to the town leperos , sir , the sight of his black whiskers and white teeth was enough for them . They quailed before him , sir . That ’ s what the force of character will do for you. ” It could very well be said that it was Nostromo alone who saved the lives of these gentlemen . Captain Mitchell , on his part , never left them till he had seen them collapse , panting , terrified , and exasperated , but safe , on the luxuriant velvet sofas in the first-class saloon of the Minerva . To the very last he had been careful to address the ex-Dictator as “ Your Excellency. ” “ Sir , I could do no other . The man was down -- ghastly , livid , one mass of scratches. ” The Minerva never let go her anchor that call . The superintendent ordered her out of the harbour at once . No cargo could be landed , of course , and the passengers for Sulaco naturally refused to go ashore . They could hear the firing and see plainly the fight going on at the edge of the water . The repulsed mob devoted its energies to an attack upon the Custom House , a dreary , unfinished-looking structure with many windows two hundred yards away from the O.S.N . Offices , and the only other building near the harbour . Captain Mitchell , after directing the commander of the Minerva to land “ these gentlemen ” in the first port of call outside Costaguana , went back in his gig to see what could be done for the protection of the Company ’ s property . That and the property of the railway were preserved by the European residents ; that is , by Captain Mitchell himself and the staff of engineers building the road , aided by the Italian and Basque workmen who rallied faithfully round their English chiefs . The Company ’ s lightermen , too , natives of the Republic , behaved very well under their Capataz . An outcast lot of very mixed blood , mainly negroes , everlastingly at feud with the other customers of low grog shops in the town , they embraced with delight this opportunity to settle their personal scores under such favourable auspices . There was not one of them that had not , at some time or other , looked with terror at Nostromo ’ s revolver poked very close at his face , or been otherwise daunted by Nostromo ’ s resolution . He was “ much of a man , ” their Capataz was , they said , too scornful in his temper ever to utter abuse , a tireless taskmaster , and the more to be feared because of his aloofness . And behold ! there he was that day , at their head , condescending to make jocular remarks to this man or the other . Such leadership was inspiriting , and in truth all the harm the mob managed to achieve was to set fire to one -- only one -- stack of railway-sleepers , which , being creosoted , burned well . The main attack on the railway yards , on the O.S.N . Offices , and especially on the Custom House , whose strong room , it was well known , contained a large treasure in silver ingots , failed completely . Even the little hotel kept by old Giorgio , standing alone halfway between the harbour and the town , escaped looting and destruction , not by a miracle , but because with the safes in view they had neglected it at first , and afterwards found no leisure to stop . Nostromo , with his Cargadores , was pressing them too hard then . CHAPTER THREE It might have been said that there he was only protecting his own . From the first he had been admitted to live in the intimacy of the family of the hotel-keeper who was a countryman of his . Old Giorgio Viola , a Genoese with a shaggy white leonine head -- often called simply “ the Garibaldino ” ( as Mohammedans are called after their prophet ) -- was , to use Captain Mitchell ’ s own words , the “ respectable married friend ” by whose advice Nostromo had left his ship to try for a run of shore luck in Costaguana . The old man , full of scorn for the populace , as your austere republican so often is , had disregarded the preliminary sounds of trouble . He went on that day as usual pottering about the “ casa ” in his slippers , muttering angrily to himself his contempt of the non-political nature of the riot , and shrugging his shoulders . In the end he was taken unawares by the out-rush of the rabble . It was too late then to remove his family , and , indeed , where could he have run to with the portly Signora Teresa and two little girls on that great plain ? So , barricading every opening , the old man sat down sternly in the middle of the darkened cafe with an old shot-gun on his knees . His wife sat on another chair by his side , muttering pious invocations to all the saints of the calendar . The old republican did not believe in saints , or in prayers , or in what he called “ priest ’ s religion. ” Liberty and Garibaldi were his divinities ; but he tolerated “ superstition ” in women , preserving in these matters a lofty and silent attitude . His two girls , the eldest fourteen , and the other two years younger , crouched on the sanded floor , on each side of the Signora Teresa , with their heads on their mother ’ s lap , both scared , but each in her own way , the dark-haired Linda indignant and angry , the fair Giselle , the younger , bewildered and resigned . The Patrona removed her arms , which embraced her daughters , for a moment to cross herself and wring her hands hurriedly . She moaned a little louder . “ Oh ! Gian ’ Battista , why art thou not here ? Oh ! why art thou not here ? ” She was not then invoking the saint himself , but calling upon Nostromo , whose patron he was . And Giorgio , motionless on the chair by her side , would be provoked by these reproachful and distracted appeals . “ Peace , woman ! Where ’ s the sense of it ? There ’ s his duty , ” he murmured in the dark ; and she would retort , panting -- “ Eh ! I have no patience . Duty ! What of the woman who has been like a mother to him ? I bent my knee to him this morning ; don ’ t you go out , Gian ’ Battista -- stop in the house , Battistino -- look at those two little innocent children ! ” Mrs. Viola was an Italian , too , a native of Spezzia , and though considerably younger than her husband , already middle-aged . She had a handsome face , whose complexion had turned yellow because the climate of Sulaco did not suit her at all . Her voice was a rich contralto . When , with her arms folded tight under her ample bosom , she scolded the squat , thick-legged China girls handling linen , plucking fowls , pounding corn in wooden mortars amongst the mud outbuildings at the back of the house , she could bring out such an impassioned , vibrating , sepulchral note that the chained watch-dog bolted into his kennel with a great rattle . Luis , a cinnamon-coloured mulatto with a sprouting moustache and thick , dark lips , would stop sweeping the cafe with a broom of palm-leaves to let a gentle shudder run down his spine . His languishing almond eyes would remain closed for a long time . This was the staff of the Casa Viola , but all these people had fled early that morning at the first sounds of the riot , preferring to hide on the plain rather than trust themselves in the house ; a preference for which they were in no way to blame , since , whether true or not , it was generally believed in the town that the Garibaldino had some money buried under the clay floor of the kitchen . The dog , an irritable , shaggy brute , barked violently and whined plaintively in turns at the back , running in and out of his kennel as rage or fear prompted him . Bursts of great shouting rose and died away , like wild gusts of wind on the plain round the barricaded house ; the fitful popping of shots grew louder above the yelling . Sometimes there were intervals of unaccountable stillness outside , and nothing could have been more gaily peaceful than the narrow bright lines of sunlight from the cracks in the shutters , ruled straight across the cafe over the disarranged chairs and tables to the wall opposite . Old Giorgio had chosen that bare , whitewashed room for a retreat . It had only one window , and its only door swung out upon the track of thick dust fenced by aloe hedges between the harbour and the town , where clumsy carts used to creak along behind slow yokes of oxen guided by boys on horseback . In a pause of stillness Giorgio cocked his gun . The ominous sound wrung a low moan from the rigid figure of the woman sitting by his side . A sudden outbreak of defiant yelling quite near the house sank all at once to a confused murmur of growls . Somebody ran along ; the loud catching of his breath was heard for an instant passing the door ; there were hoarse mutters and footsteps near the wall ; a shoulder rubbed against the shutter , effacing the bright lines of sunshine pencilled across the whole breadth of the room . Signora Teresa ’ s arms thrown about the kneeling forms of her daughters embraced them closer with a convulsive pressure . The mob , driven away from the Custom House , had broken up into several bands , retreating across the plain in the direction of the town . The subdued crash of irregular volleys fired in the distance was answered by faint yells far away . In the intervals the single shots rang feebly , and the low , long , white building blinded in every window seemed to be the centre of a turmoil widening in a great circle about its closed-up silence . But the cautious movements and whispers of a routed party seeking a momentary shelter behind the wall made the darkness of the room , striped by threads of quiet sunlight , alight with evil , stealthy sounds . The Violas had them in their ears as though invisible ghosts hovering about their chairs had consulted in mutters as to the advisability of setting fire to this foreigner ’ s casa . It was trying to the nerves . Old Viola had risen slowly , gun in hand , irresolute , for he did not see how he could prevent them . Already voices could be heard talking at the back . Signora Teresa was beside herself with terror . “ Ah ! the traitor ! the traitor ! ” she mumbled , almost inaudibly . “ Now we are going to be burnt ; and I bent my knee to him . No ! he must run at the heels of his English. ” She seemed to think that Nostromo ’ s mere presence in the house would have made it perfectly safe . So far , she , too , was under the spell of that reputation the Capataz de Cargadores had made for himself by the waterside , along the railway line , with the English and with the populace of Sulaco . To his face , and even against her husband , she invariably affected to laugh it to scorn , sometimes good-naturedly , more often with a curious bitterness . But then women are unreasonable in their opinions , as Giorgio used to remark calmly on fitting occasions . On this occasion , with his gun held at ready before him , he stooped down to his wife ’ s head , and , keeping his eyes steadfastly on the barricaded door , he breathed out into her ear that Nostromo would have been powerless to help . What could two men shut up in a house do against twenty or more bent upon setting fire to the roof ? Gian ’ Battista was thinking of the casa all the time , he was sure . “ He think of the casa ! He ! ” gasped Signora Viola , crazily . She struck her breast with her open hands . “ I know him . He thinks of nobody but himself. ” A discharge of firearms near by made her throw her head back and close her eyes . Old Giorgio set his teeth hard under his white moustache , and his eyes began to roll fiercely . Several bullets struck the end of the wall together ; pieces of plaster could be heard falling outside ; a voice screamed “ Here they come ! ” and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feet along the front . Then the tension of old Giorgio ’ s attitude relaxed , and a smile of contemptuous relief came upon his lips of an old fighter with a leonine face . These were not a people striving for justice , but thieves . Even to defend his life against them was a sort of degradation for a man who had been one of Garibaldi ’ s immortal thousand in the conquest of Sicily . He had an immense scorn for this outbreak of scoundrels and leperos , who did not know the meaning of the word “ liberty. ” He grounded his old gun , and , turning his head , glanced at the coloured lithograph of Garibaldi in a black frame on the white wall ; a thread of strong sunshine cut it perpendicularly . His eyes , accustomed to the luminous twilight , made out the high colouring of the face , the red of the shirt , the outlines of the square shoulders , the black patch of the Bersagliere hat with cock ’ s feathers curling over the crown . An immortal hero ! This was your liberty ; it gave you not only life , but immortality as well ! For that one man his fanaticism had suffered no diminution . In the moment of relief from the apprehension of the greatest danger , perhaps , his family had been exposed to in all their wanderings , he had turned to the picture of his old chief , first and only , then laid his hand on his wife ’ s shoulder . The children kneeling on the floor had not moved . Signora Teresa opened her eyes a little , as though he had awakened her from a very deep and dreamless slumber . Before he had time in his deliberate way to say a reassuring word she jumped up , with the children clinging to her , one on each side , gasped for breath , and let out a hoarse shriek . It was simultaneous with the bang of a violent blow struck on the outside of the shutter . They could hear suddenly the snorting of a horse , the restive tramping of hoofs on the narrow , hard path in front of the house ; the toe of a boot struck at the shutter again ; a spur jingled at every blow , and an excited voice shouted , “ Hola ! hola , in there ! ” CHAPTER FOUR All the morning Nostromo had kept his eye from afar on the Casa Viola , even in the thick of the hottest scrimmage near the Custom House . “ If I see smoke rising over there , ” he thought to himself , “ they are lost. ” Directly the mob had broken he pressed with a small band of Italian workmen in that direction , which , indeed , was the shortest line towards the town . That part of the rabble he was pursuing seemed to think of making a stand under the house ; a volley fired by his followers from behind an aloe hedge made the rascals fly . In a gap chopped out for the rails of the harbour branch line Nostromo appeared , mounted on his silver-grey mare . He shouted , sent after them one shot from his revolver , and galloped up to the cafe window . He had an idea that old Giorgio would choose that part of the house for a refuge . His voice had penetrated to them , sounding breathlessly hurried : “ Hola ! Vecchio ! O , Vecchio ! Is it all well with you in there ? ” “ You see -- ” murmured old Viola to his wife . Signora Teresa was silent now . Outside Nostromo laughed . “ I can hear the padrona is not dead. ” “ You have done your best to kill me with fear , ” cried Signora Teresa . She wanted to say something more , but her voice failed her . Linda raised her eyes to her face for a moment , but old Giorgio shouted apologetically -- “ She is a little upset. ” Outside Nostromo shouted back with another laugh -- “ She can not upset me. ” Signora Teresa found her voice . “ It is what I say . You have no heart -- and you have no conscience , Gian ’ Battista -- ” They heard him wheel his horse away from the shutters . The party he led were babbling excitedly in Italian and Spanish , inciting each other to the pursuit . He put himself at their head , crying , “ Avanti ! ” “ He has not stopped very long with us . There is no praise from strangers to be got here , ” Signora Teresa said tragically . “ Avanti ! Yes ! That is all he cares for . To be first somewhere -- somehow -- to be first with these English . They will be showing him to everybody . ‘ This is our Nostromo ! ’ ” She laughed ominously . “ What a name ! What is that ? Nostromo ? He would take a name that is properly no word from them. ” Meantime Giorgio , with tranquil movements , had been unfastening the door ; the flood of light fell on Signora Teresa , with her two girls gathered to her side , a picturesque woman in a pose of maternal exaltation . Behind her the wall was dazzlingly white , and the crude colours of the Garibaldi lithograph paled in the sunshine . Old Viola , at the door , moved his arm upwards as if referring all his quick , fleeting thoughts to the picture of his old chief on the wall . Even when he was cooking for the “ Signori Inglesi ” -- the engineers ( he was a famous cook , though the kitchen was a dark place ) -- he was , as it were , under the eye of the great man who had led him in a glorious struggle where , under the walls of Gaeta , tyranny would have expired for ever had it not been for that accursed Piedmontese race of kings and ministers . When sometimes a frying-pan caught fire during a delicate operation with some shredded onions , and the old man was seen backing out of the doorway , swearing and coughing violently in an acrid cloud of smoke , the name of Cavour -- the arch intriguer sold to kings and tyrants -- could be heard involved in imprecations against the China girls , cooking in general , and the brute of a country where he was reduced to live for the love of liberty that traitor had strangled . Then Signora Teresa , all in black , issuing from another door , advanced , portly and anxious , inclining her fine , black-browed head , opening her arms , and crying in a profound tone -- “ Giorgio ! thou passionate man ! Misericordia Divina ! In the sun like this ! He will make himself ill. ” At her feet the hens made off in all directions , with immense strides ; if there were any engineers from up the line staying in Sulaco , a young English face or two would appear at the billiard-room occupying one end of the house ; but at the other end , in the cafe , Luis , the mulatto , took good care not to show himself . The Indian girls , with hair like flowing black manes , and dressed only in a shift and short petticoat , stared dully from under the square-cut fringes on their foreheads ; the noisy frizzling of fat had stopped , the fumes floated upwards in sunshine , a strong smell of burnt onions hung in the drowsy heat , enveloping the house ; and the eye lost itself in a vast flat expanse of grass to the west , as if the plain between the Sierra overtopping Sulaco and the coast range away there towards Esmeralda had been as big as half the world . Signora Teresa , after an impressive pause , remonstrated -- “ Eh , Giorgio ! Leave Cavour alone and take care of yourself now we are lost in this country all alone with the two children , because you can not live under a king. ” And while she looked at him she would sometimes put her hand hastily to her side with a short twitch of her fine lips and a knitting of her black , straight eyebrows like a flicker of angry pain or an angry thought on her handsome , regular features . It was pain ; she suppressed the twinge . It had come to her first a few years after they had left Italy to emigrate to America and settle at last in Sulaco after wandering from town to town , trying shopkeeping in a small way here and there ; and once an organized enterprise of fishing -- in Maldonado -- for Giorgio , like the great Garibaldi , had been a sailor in his time . Sometimes she had no patience with pain . For years its gnawing had been part of the landscape embracing the glitter of the harbour under the wooded spurs of the range ; and the sunshine itself was heavy and dull -- heavy with pain -- not like the sunshine of her girlhood , in which middle-aged Giorgio had wooed her gravely and passionately on the shores of the gulf of Spezzia . “ You go in at once , Giorgio , ” she directed . “ One would think you do not wish to have any pity on me -- with four Signori Inglesi staying in the house. ” “ _Va bene , va bene_ , ” Giorgio would mutter . He obeyed . The Signori Inglesi would require their midday meal presently . He had been one of the immortal and invincible band of liberators who had made the mercenaries of tyranny fly like chaff before a hurricane , “ _un uragano terribile_. ” But that was before he was married and had children ; and before tyranny had reared its head again amongst the traitors who had imprisoned Garibaldi , his hero . There were three doors in the front of the house , and each afternoon the Garibaldino could be seen at one or another of them with his big bush of white hair , his arms folded , his legs crossed , leaning back his leonine head against the side , and looking up the wooded slopes of the foothills at the snowy dome of Higuerota . The front of his house threw off a black long rectangle of shade , broadening slowly over the soft ox-cart track . Through the gaps , chopped out in the oleander hedges , the harbour branch railway , laid out temporarily on the level of the plain , curved away its shining parallel ribbons on a belt of scorched and withered grass within sixty yards of the end of the house . In the evening the empty material trains of flat cars circled round the dark green grove of Sulaco , and ran , undulating slightly with white jets of steam , over the plain towards the Casa Viola , on their way to the railway yards by the harbour . The Italian drivers saluted him from the foot-plate with raised hand , while the negro brakesmen sat carelessly on the brakes , looking straight forward , with the rims of their big hats flapping in the wind . In return Giorgio would give a slight sideways jerk of the head , without unfolding his arms . On this memorable day of the riot his arms were not folded on his chest . His hand grasped the barrel of the gun grounded on the threshold ; he did not look up once at the white dome of Higuerota , whose cool purity seemed to hold itself aloof from a hot earth . His eyes examined the plain curiously . Tall trails of dust subsided here and there . In a speckless sky the sun hung clear and blinding . Knots of men ran headlong ; others made a stand ; and the irregular rattle of firearms came rippling to his ears in the fiery , still air . Single figures on foot raced desperately . Horsemen galloped towards each other , wheeled round together , separated at speed . Giorgio saw one fall , rider and horse disappearing as if they had galloped into a chasm , and the movements of the animated scene were like the passages of a violent game played upon the plain by dwarfs mounted and on foot , yelling with tiny throats , under the mountain that seemed a colossal embodiment of silence . Never before had Giorgio seen this bit of plain so full of active life ; his gaze could not take in all its details at once ; he shaded his eyes with his hand , till suddenly the thundering of many hoofs near by startled him . A troop of horses had broken out of the fenced paddock of the Railway Company . They came on like a whirlwind , and dashed over the line snorting , kicking , squealing in a compact , piebald , tossing mob of bay , brown , grey backs , eyes staring , necks extended , nostrils red , long tails streaming . As soon as they had leaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from under their hoofs , and within six yards of Giorgio only a brown cloud with vague forms of necks and cruppers rolled by , making the soil tremble on its passage . Viola coughed , turning his face away from the dust , and shaking his head slightly . “ There will be some horse-catching to be done before to-night , ” he muttered . In the square of sunlight falling through the door Signora Teresa , kneeling before the chair , had bowed her head , heavy with a twisted mass of ebony hair streaked with silver , into the palm of her hands . The black lace shawl she used to drape about her face had dropped to the ground by her side . The two girls had got up , hand-in-hand , in short skirts , their loose hair falling in disorder . The younger had thrown her arm across her eyes , as if afraid to face the light . Linda , with her hand on the other ’ s shoulder , stared fearlessly . Viola looked at his children . The sun brought out the deep lines on his face , and , energetic in expression , it had the immobility of a carving . It was impossible to discover what he thought . Bushy grey eyebrows shaded his dark glance . “ Well ! And do you not pray like your mother ? ” Linda pouted , advancing her red lips , which were almost too red ; but she had admirable eyes , brown , with a sparkle of gold in the irises , full of intelligence and meaning , and so clear that they seemed to throw a glow upon her thin , colourless face . There were bronze glints in the sombre clusters of her hair , and the eyelashes , long and coal black , made her complexion appear still more pale . “ Mother is going to offer up a lot of candles in the church . She always does when Nostromo has been away fighting . I shall have some to carry up to the Chapel of the Madonna in the Cathedral. ” She said all this quickly , with great assurance , in an animated , penetrating voice . Then , giving her sister ’ s shoulder a slight shake , she added -- “ And she will be made to carry one , too ! ” “ Why made ? ” inquired Giorgio , gravely . “ Does she not want to ? ” “ She is timid , ” said Linda , with a little burst of laughter . “ People notice her fair hair as she goes along with us . They call out after her , ‘ Look at the Rubia ! Look at the Rubiacita ! ’ They call out in the streets . She is timid. ” “ And you ? You are not timid -- eh ? ” the father pronounced , slowly . She tossed back all her dark hair . “ Nobody calls out after me. ” Old Giorgio contemplated his children thoughtfully . There was two years difference between them . They had been born to him late , years after the boy had died . Had he lived he would have been nearly as old as Gian ’ Battista -- he whom the English called Nostromo ; but as to his daughters , the severity of his temper , his advancing age , his absorption in his memories , had prevented his taking much notice of them . He loved his children , but girls belong more to the mother , and much of his affection had been expended in the worship and service of liberty . When quite a youth he had deserted from a ship trading to La Plata , to enlist in the navy of Montevideo , then under the command of Garibaldi . Afterwards , in the Italian legion of the Republic struggling against the encroaching tyranny of Rosas , he had taken part , on great plains , on the banks of immense rivers , in the fiercest fighting perhaps the world had ever known . He had lived amongst men who had declaimed about liberty , suffered for liberty , died for liberty , with a desperate exaltation , and with their eyes turned towards an oppressed Italy . His own enthusiasm had been fed on scenes of carnage , on the examples of lofty devotion , on the din of armed struggle , on the inflamed language of proclamations . He had never parted from the chief of his choice -- the fiery apostle of independence -- keeping by his side in America and in Italy till after the fatal day of Aspromonte , when the treachery of kings , emperors , and ministers had been revealed to the world in the wounding and imprisonment of his hero -- a catastrophe that had instilled into him a gloomy doubt of ever being able to understand the ways of Divine justice . He did not deny it , however . It required patience , he would say . Though he disliked priests , and would not put his foot inside a church for anything , he believed in God . Were not the proclamations against tyrants addressed to the peoples in the name of God and liberty ? “ God for men -- religions for women , ” he muttered sometimes . In Sicily , an Englishman who had turned up in Palermo after its evacuation by the army of the king , had given him a Bible in Italian -- the publication of the British and Foreign Bible Society , bound in a dark leather cover . In periods of political adversity , in the pauses of silence when the revolutionists issued no proclamations , Giorgio earned his living with the first work that came to hand -- as sailor , as dock labourer on the quays of Genoa , once as a hand on a farm in the hills above Spezzia -- and in his spare time he studied the thick volume . He carried it with him into battles . Now it was his only reading , and in order not to be deprived of it ( the print was small ) he had consented to accept the present of a pair of silver-mounted spectacles from Senora Emilia Gould , the wife of the Englishman who managed the silver mine in the mountains three leagues from the town . She was the only Englishwoman in Sulaco . Giorgio Viola had a great consideration for the English . This feeling , born on the battlefields of Uruguay , was forty years old at the very least . Several of them had poured their blood for the cause of freedom in America , and the first he had ever known he remembered by the name of Samuel ; he commanded a negro company under Garibaldi , during the famous siege of Montevideo , and died heroically with his negroes at the fording of the Boyana . He , Giorgio , had reached the rank of ensign-alferez-and cooked for the general . Later , in Italy , he , with the rank of lieutenant , rode with the staff and still cooked for the general . He had cooked for him in Lombardy through the whole campaign ; on the march to Rome he had lassoed his beef in the Campagna after the American manner ; he had been wounded in the defence of the Roman Republic ; he was one of the four fugitives who , with the general , carried out of the woods the inanimate body of the general ’ s wife into the farmhouse where she died , exhausted by the hardships of that terrible retreat . He had survived that disastrous time to attend his general in Palermo when the Neapolitan shells from the castle crashed upon the town . He had cooked for him on the field of Volturno after fighting all day . And everywhere he had seen Englishmen in the front rank of the army of freedom . He respected their nation because they loved Garibaldi . Their very countesses and princesses had kissed the general ’ s hands in London , it was said . He could well believe it ; for the nation was noble , and the man was a saint . It was enough to look once at his face to see the divine force of faith in him and his great pity for all that was poor , suffering , and oppressed in this world . The spirit of self-forgetfulness , the simple devotion to a vast humanitarian idea which inspired the thought and stress of that revolutionary time , had left its mark upon Giorgio in a sort of austere contempt for all personal advantage . This man , whom the lowest class in Sulaco suspected of having a buried hoard in his kitchen , had all his life despised money . The leaders of his youth had lived poor , had died poor . It had been a habit of his mind to disregard to-morrow . It was engendered partly by an existence of excitement , adventure , and wild warfare . But mostly it was a matter of principle . It did not resemble the carelessness of a condottiere , it was a puritanism of conduct , born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism of religion . This stern devotion to a cause had cast a gloom upon Giorgio ’ s old age . It cast a gloom because the cause seemed lost . Too many kings and emperors flourished yet in the world which God had meant for the people . He was sad because of his simplicity . Though always ready to help his countrymen , and greatly respected by the Italian emigrants wherever he lived ( in his exile he called it ) , he could not conceal from himself that they cared nothing for the wrongs of down-trodden nations . They listened to his tales of war readily , but seemed to ask themselves what he had got out of it after all . There was nothing that they could see . “ We wanted nothing , we suffered for the love of all humanity ! ” he cried out furiously sometimes , and the powerful voice , the blazing eyes , the shaking of the white mane , the brown , sinewy hand pointing upwards as if to call heaven to witness , impressed his hearers . After the old man had broken off abruptly with a jerk of the head and a movement of the arm , meaning clearly , “ But what ’ s the good of talking to you ? ” they nudged each other . There was in old Giorgio an energy of feeling , a personal quality of conviction , something they called “ terribilita ” -- “ an old lion , ” they used to say of him . Some slight incident , a chance word would set him off talking on the beach to the Italian fishermen of Maldonado , in the little shop he kept afterwards ( in Valparaiso ) to his countrymen customers ; of an evening , suddenly , in the cafe at one end of the Casa Viola ( the other was reserved for the English engineers ) to the select clientele of engine-drivers and foremen of the railway shops . With their handsome , bronzed , lean faces , shiny black ringlets , glistening eyes , broad-chested , bearded , sometimes a tiny gold ring in the lobe of the ear , the aristocracy of the railway works listened to him , turning away from their cards or dominoes . Here and there a fair-haired Basque studied his hand meantime , waiting without protest . No native of Costaguana intruded there . This was the Italian stronghold . Even the Sulaco policemen on a night patrol let their horses pace softly by , bending low in the saddle to glance through the window at the heads in a fog of smoke ; and the drone of old Giorgio ’ s declamatory narrative seemed to sink behind them into the plain . Only now and then the assistant of the chief of police , some broad-faced , brown little gentleman , with a great deal of Indian in him , would put in an appearance . Leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced with a confident , sly smile , and without a word up to the long trestle table . He pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf ; Giorgio , thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly , served him in person . Nothing would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs . His glass emptied , he would take a leisurely , scrutinizing look all round the room , go out , and ride away slowly , circling towards the town . CHAPTER FIVE In this way only was the power of the local authorities vindicated amongst the great body of strong-limbed foreigners who dug the earth , blasted the rocks , drove the engines for the “ progressive and patriotic undertaking. ” In these very words eighteen months before the Excellentissimo Senor don Vincente Ribiera , the Dictator of Costaguana , had described the National Central Railway in his great speech at the turning of the first sod . He had come on purpose to Sulaco , and there was a one-o ’ clock dinner-party , a convite offered by the O.S.N . Company on board the Juno after the function on shore . Captain Mitchell had himself steered the cargo lighter , all draped with flags , which , in tow of the Juno ’ s steam launch , took the Excellentissimo from the jetty to the ship . Everybody of note in Sulaco had been invited -- the one or two foreign merchants , all the representatives of the old Spanish families then in town , the great owners of estates on the plain , grave , courteous , simple men , caballeros of pure descent , with small hands and feet , conservative , hospitable , and kind . The Occidental Province was their stronghold ; their Blanco party had triumphed now ; it was their President-Dictator , a Blanco of the Blancos , who sat smiling urbanely between the representatives of two friendly foreign powers . They had come with him from Sta . Marta to countenance by their presence the enterprise in which the capital of their countries was engaged . The only lady of that company was Mrs. Gould , the wife of Don Carlos , the administrator of the San Tome silver mine . The ladies of Sulaco were not advanced enough to take part in the public life to that extent . They had come out strongly at the great ball at the Intendencia the evening before , but Mrs. Gould alone had appeared , a bright spot in the group of black coats behind the President-Dictator , on the crimson cloth-covered stage erected under a shady tree on the shore of the harbour , where the ceremony of turning the first sod had taken place . She had come off in the cargo lighter , full of notabilities , sitting under the flutter of gay flags , in the place of honour by the side of Captain Mitchell , who steered , and her clear dress gave the only truly festive note to the sombre gathering in the long , gorgeous saloon of the Juno . The head of the chairman of the railway board ( from London ) , handsome and pale in a silvery mist of white hair and clipped beard , hovered near her shoulder attentive , smiling , and fatigued . The journey from London to Sta . Marta in mail boats and the special carriages of the Sta . Marta coast-line ( the only railway so far ) had been tolerable -- even pleasant -- quite tolerable . But the trip over the mountains to Sulaco was another sort of experience , in an old diligencia over impassable roads skirting awful precipices . “ We have been upset twice in one day on the brink of very deep ravines , ” he was telling Mrs. Gould in an undertone . “ And when we arrived here at last I don ’ t know what we should have done without your hospitality . What an out-of-the-way place Sulaco is ! -- and for a harbour , too ! Astonishing ! ” “ Ah , but we are very proud of it . It used to be historically important . The highest ecclesiastical court for two viceroyalties , sat here in the olden time , ” she instructed him with animation . “ I am impressed . I didn ’ t mean to be disparaging . You seem very patriotic. ” “ The place is lovable , if only by its situation . Perhaps you don ’ t know what an old resident I am. ” “ How old , I wonder , ” he murmured , looking at her with a slight smile . Mrs. Gould ’ s appearance was made youthful by the mobile intelligence of her face . “ We can ’ t give you your ecclesiastical court back again ; but you shall have more steamers , a railway , a telegraph-cable -- a future in the great world which is worth infinitely more than any amount of ecclesiastical past . You shall be brought in touch with something greater than two viceroyalties . But I had no notion that a place on a sea-coast could remain so isolated from the world . If it had been a thousand miles inland now -- most remarkable ! Has anything ever happened here for a hundred years before to-day ? ” While he talked in a slow , humorous tone , she kept her little smile . Agreeing ironically , she assured him that certainly not -- nothing ever happened in Sulaco . Even the revolutions , of which there had been two in her time , had respected the repose of the place . Their course ran in the more populous southern parts of the Republic , and the great valley of Sta . Marta , which was like one great battlefield of the parties , with the possession of the capital for a prize and an outlet to another ocean . They were more advanced over there . Here in Sulaco they heard only the echoes of these great questions , and , of course , their official world changed each time , coming to them over their rampart of mountains which he himself had traversed in an old diligencia , with such a risk to life and limb . The chairman of the railway had been enjoying her hospitality for several days , and he was really grateful for it . It was only since he had left Sta . Marta that he had utterly lost touch with the feeling of European life on the background of his exotic surroundings . In the capital he had been the guest of the Legation , and had been kept busy negotiating with the members of Don Vincente ’ s Government -- cultured men , men to whom the conditions of civilized business were not unknown . What concerned him most at the time was the acquisition of land for the railway . In the Sta . Marta Valley , where there was already one line in existence , the people were tractable , and it was only a matter of price . A commission had been nominated to fix the values , and the difficulty resolved itself into the judicious influencing of the Commissioners . But in Sulaco -- the Occidental Province for whose very development the railway was intended -- there had been trouble . It had been lying for ages ensconced behind its natural barriers , repelling modern enterprise by the precipices of its mountain range , by its shallow harbour opening into the everlasting calms of a gulf full of clouds , by the benighted state of mind of the owners of its fertile territory -- all these aristocratic old Spanish families , all those Don Ambrosios this and Don Fernandos that , who seemed actually to dislike and distrust the coming of the railway over their lands . It had happened that some of the surveying parties scattered all over the province had been warned off with threats of violence . In other cases outrageous pretensions as to price had been raised . But the man of railways prided himself on being equal to every emergency . Since he was met by the inimical sentiment of blind conservatism in Sulaco he would meet it by sentiment , too , before taking his stand on his right alone . The Government was bound to carry out its part of the contract with the board of the new railway company , even if it had to use force for the purpose . But he desired nothing less than an armed disturbance in the smooth working of his plans . They were much too vast and far-reaching , and too promising to leave a stone unturned ; and so he imagined to get the President-Dictator over there on a tour of ceremonies and speeches , culminating in a great function at the turning of the first sod by the harbour shore . After all he was their own creature -- that Don Vincente . He was the embodied triumph of the best elements in the State . These were facts , and , unless facts meant nothing , Sir John argued to himself , such a man ’ s influence must be real , and his personal action would produce the conciliatory effect he required . He had succeeded in arranging the trip with the help of a very clever advocate , who was known in Sta . Marta as the agent of the Gould silver mine , the biggest thing in Sulaco , and even in the whole Republic . It was indeed a fabulously rich mine . Its so-called agent , evidently a man of culture and ability , seemed , without official position , to possess an extraordinary influence in the highest Government spheres . He was able to assure Sir John that the President-Dictator would make the journey . He regretted , however , in the course of the same conversation , that General Montero insisted upon going , too . General Montero , whom the beginning of the struggle had found an obscure army captain employed on the wild eastern frontier of the State , had thrown in his lot with the Ribiera party at a moment when special circumstances had given that small adhesion a fortuitous importance . The fortunes of war served him marvellously , and the victory of Rio Seco ( after a day of desperate fighting ) put a seal to his success . At the end he emerged General , Minister of War , and the military head of the Blanco party , although there was nothing aristocratic in his descent . Indeed , it was said that he and his brother , orphans , had been brought up by the munificence of a famous European traveller , in whose service their father had lost his life . Another story was that their father had been nothing but a charcoal burner in the woods , and their mother a baptised Indian woman from the far interior . However that might be , the Costaguana Press was in the habit of styling Montero ’ s forest march from his commandancia to join the Blanco forces at the beginning of the troubles , the “ most heroic military exploit of modern times. ” About the same time , too , his brother had turned up from Europe , where he had gone apparently as secretary to a consul . Having , however , collected a small band of outlaws , he showed some talent as guerilla chief and had been rewarded at the pacification by the post of Military Commandant of the capital . The Minister of War , then , accompanied the Dictator . The board of the O.S.N . Company , working hand-in-hand with the railway people for the good of the Republic , had on this important occasion instructed Captain Mitchell to put the mail-boat Juno at the disposal of the distinguished party . Don Vincente , journeying south from Sta . Marta , had embarked at Cayta , the principal port of Costaguana , and came to Sulaco by sea . But the chairman of the railway company had courageously crossed the mountains in a ramshackle diligencia , mainly for the purpose of meeting his engineer-in-chief engaged in the final survey of the road . For all the indifference of a man of affairs to nature , whose hostility can always be overcome by the resources of finance , he could not help being impressed by his surroundings during his halt at the surveying camp established at the highest point his railway was to reach . He spent the night there , arriving just too late to see the last dying glow of sunlight upon the snowy flank of Higuerota . Pillared masses of black basalt framed like an open portal a portion of the white field lying aslant against the west . In the transparent air of the high altitudes everything seemed very near , steeped in a clear stillness as in an imponderable liquid ; and with his ear ready to catch the first sound of the expected diligencia the engineer-in-chief , at the door of a hut of rough stones , had contemplated the changing hues on the enormous side of the mountain , thinking that in this sight , as in a piece of inspired music , there could be found together the utmost delicacy of shaded expression and a stupendous magnificence of effect . Sir John arrived too late to hear the magnificent and inaudible strain sung by the sunset amongst the high peaks of the Sierra . It had sung itself out into the breathless pause of deep dusk before , climbing down the fore wheel of the diligencia with stiff limbs , he shook hands with the engineer . They gave him his dinner in a stone hut like a cubical boulder , with no door or windows in its two openings ; a bright fire of sticks ( brought on muleback from the first valley below ) burning outside , sent in a wavering glare ; and two candles in tin candlesticks -- lighted , it was explained to him , in his honour -- stood on a sort of rough camp table , at which he sat on the right hand of the chief . He knew how to be amiable ; and the young men of the engineering staff , for whom the surveying of the railway track had the glamour of the first steps on the path of life , sat there , too , listening modestly , with their smooth faces tanned by the weather , and very pleased to witness so much affability in so great a man . Afterwards , late at night , pacing to and fro outside , he had a long talk with his chief engineer . He knew him well of old . This was not the first undertaking in which their gifts , as elementally different as fire and water , had worked in conjunction . From the contact of these two personalities , who had not the same vision of the world , there was generated a power for the world ’ s service -- a subtle force that could set in motion mighty machines , men ’ s muscles , and awaken also in human breasts an unbounded devotion to the task . Of the young fellows at the table , to whom the survey of the track was like the tracing of the path of life , more than one would be called to meet death before the work was done . But the work would be done : the force would be almost as strong as a faith . Not quite , however . In the silence of the sleeping camp upon the moonlit plateau forming the top of the pass like the floor of a vast arena surrounded by the basalt walls of precipices , two strolling figures in thick ulsters stood still , and the voice of the engineer pronounced distinctly the words -- “ We can ’ t move mountains ! ” Sir John , raising his head to follow the pointing gesture , felt the full force of the words . The white Higuerota soared out of the shadows of rock and earth like a frozen bubble under the moon . All was still , till near by , behind the wall of a corral for the camp animals , built roughly of loose stones in the form of a circle , a pack mule stamped his forefoot and blew heavily twice . The engineer-in-chief had used the phrase in answer to the chairman ’ s tentative suggestion that the tracing of the line could , perhaps , be altered in deference to the prejudices of the Sulaco landowners . The chief engineer believed that the obstinacy of men was the lesser obstacle . Moreover , to combat that they had the great influence of Charles Gould , whereas tunnelling under Higuerota would have been a colossal undertaking . “ Ah , yes ! Gould . What sort of a man is he ? ” Sir John had heard much of Charles Gould in Sta . Marta , and wanted to know more . The engineer-in-chief assured him that the administrator of the San Tome silver mine had an immense influence over all these Spanish Dons . He had also one of the best houses in Sulaco , and the Gould hospitality was beyond all praise . “ They received me as if they had known me for years , ” he said . “ The little lady is kindness personified . I stayed with them for a month . He helped me to organize the surveying parties . His practical ownership of the San Tome silver mine gives him a special position . He seems to have the ear of every provincial authority apparently , and , as I said , he can wind all the hidalgos of the province round his little finger . If you follow his advice the difficulties will fall away , because he wants the railway . Of course , you must be careful in what you say . He ’ s English , and besides he must be immensely wealthy . The Holroyd house is in with him in that mine , so you may imagine -- ” He interrupted himself as , from before one of the little fires burning outside the low wall of the corral , arose the figure of a man wrapped in a poncho up to the neck . The saddle which he had been using for a pillow made a dark patch on the ground against the red glow of embers . “ I shall see Holroyd himself on my way back through the States , ” said Sir John . “ I ’ ve ascertained that he , too , wants the railway. ” The man who , perhaps disturbed by the proximity of the voices , had arisen from the ground , struck a match to light a cigarette . The flame showed a bronzed , black-whiskered face , a pair of eyes gazing straight ; then , rearranging his wrappings , he sank full length and laid his head again on the saddle . “ That ’ s our camp-master , whom I must send back to Sulaco now we are going to carry our survey into the Sta . Marta Valley , ” said the engineer . “ A most useful fellow , lent me by Captain Mitchell of the O.S.N . Company . It was very good of Mitchell . Charles Gould told me I couldn ’ t do better than take advantage of the offer . He seems to know how to rule all these muleteers and peons . We had not the slightest trouble with our people . He shall escort your diligencia right into Sulaco with some of our railway peons . The road is bad . To have him at hand may save you an upset or two . He promised me to take care of your person all the way down as if you were his father. ” This camp-master was the Italian sailor whom all the Europeans in Sulaco , following Captain Mitchell ’ s mispronunciation , were in the habit of calling Nostromo . And indeed , taciturn and ready , he did take excellent care of his charge at the bad parts of the road , as Sir John himself acknowledged to Mrs. Gould afterwards . CHAPTER SIX At that time Nostromo had been already long enough in the country to raise to the highest pitch Captain Mitchell ’ s opinion of the extraordinary value of his discovery . Clearly he was one of those invaluable subordinates whom to possess is a legitimate cause of boasting . Captain Mitchell plumed himself upon his eye for men -- but he was not selfish -- and in the innocence of his pride was already developing that mania for “ lending you my Capataz de Cargadores ” which was to bring Nostromo into personal contact , sooner or later , with every European in Sulaco , as a sort of universal factotum -- a prodigy of efficiency in his own sphere of life . “ The fellow is devoted to me , body and soul ! ” Captain Mitchell was given to affirm ; and though nobody , perhaps , could have explained why it should be so , it was impossible on a survey of their relation to throw doubt on that statement , unless , indeed , one were a bitter , eccentric character like Dr. Monygham -- for instance -- whose short , hopeless laugh expressed somehow an immense mistrust of mankind . Not that Dr. Monygham was a prodigal either of laughter or of words . He was bitterly taciturn when at his best . At his worst people feared the open scornfulness of his tongue . Only Mrs. Gould could keep his unbelief in men ’ s motives within due bounds ; but even to her ( on an occasion not connected with Nostromo , and in a tone which for him was gentle ) , even to her , he had said once , “ Really , it is most unreasonable to demand that a man should think of other people so much better than he is able to think of himself. ” And Mrs. Gould had hastened to drop the subject . There were strange rumours of the English doctor . Years ago , in the time of Guzman Bento , he had been mixed up , it was whispered , in a conspiracy which was betrayed and , as people expressed it , drowned in blood . His hair had turned grey , his hairless , seamed face was of a brick-dust colour ; the large check pattern of his flannel shirt and his old stained Panama hat were an established defiance to the conventionalities of Sulaco . Had it not been for the immaculate cleanliness of his apparel he might have been taken for one of those shiftless Europeans that are a moral eyesore to the respectability of a foreign colony in almost every exotic part of the world . The young ladies of Sulaco , adorning with clusters of pretty faces the balconies along the Street of the Constitution , when they saw him pass , with his limping gait and bowed head , a short linen jacket drawn on carelessly over the flannel check shirt , would remark to each other , “ Here is the Senor doctor going to call on Dona Emilia . He has got his little coat on. ” The inference was true . Its deeper meaning was hidden from their simple intelligence . Moreover , they expended no store of thought on the doctor . He was old , ugly , learned -- and a little “ loco ” -- mad , if not a bit of a sorcerer , as the common people suspected him of being . The little white jacket was in reality a concession to Mrs. Gould ’ s humanizing influence . The doctor , with his habit of sceptical , bitter speech , had no other means of showing his profound respect for the character of the woman who was known in the country as the English Senora . He presented this tribute very seriously indeed ; it was no trifle for a man of his habits . Mrs. Gould felt that , too , perfectly . She would never have thought of imposing upon him this marked show of deference . She kept her old Spanish house ( one of the finest specimens in Sulaco ) open for the dispensation of the small graces of existence . She dispensed them with simplicity and charm because she was guided by an alert perception of values . She was highly gifted in the art of human intercourse which consists in delicate shades of self-forgetfulness and in the suggestion of universal comprehension . Charles Gould ( the Gould family , established in Costaguana for three generations , always went to England for their education and for their wives ) imagined that he had fallen in love with a girl ’ s sound common sense like any other man , but these were not exactly the reasons why , for instance , the whole surveying camp , from the youngest of the young men to their mature chief , should have found occasion to allude to Mrs. Gould ’ s house so frequently amongst the high peaks of the Sierra . She would have protested that she had done nothing for them , with a low laugh and a surprised widening of her grey eyes , had anybody told her how convincingly she was remembered on the edge of the snow-line above Sulaco . But directly , with a little capable air of setting her wits to work , she would have found an explanation . “ Of course , it was such a surprise for these boys to find any sort of welcome here . And I suppose they are homesick . I suppose everybody must be always just a little homesick. ” She was always sorry for homesick people . Born in the country , as his father before him , spare and tall , with a flaming moustache , a neat chin , clear blue eyes , auburn hair , and a thin , fresh , red face , Charles Gould looked like a new arrival from over the sea . His grandfather had fought in the cause of independence under Bolivar , in that famous English legion which on the battlefield of Carabobo had been saluted by the great Liberator as Saviours of his country . One of Charles Gould ’ s uncles had been the elected President of that very province of Sulaco ( then called a State ) in the days of Federation , and afterwards had been put up against the wall of a church and shot by the order of the barbarous Unionist general , Guzman Bento . It was the same Guzman Bento who , becoming later Perpetual President , famed for his ruthless and cruel tyranny , readied his apotheosis in the popular legend of a sanguinary land-haunting spectre whose body had been carried off by the devil in person from the brick mausoleum in the nave of the Church of Assumption in Sta . Marta . Thus , at least , the priests explained its disappearance to the barefooted multitude that streamed in , awestruck , to gaze at the hole in the side of the ugly box of bricks before the great altar . Guzman Bento of cruel memory had put to death great numbers of people besides Charles Gould ’ s uncle ; but with a relative martyred in the cause of aristocracy , the Sulaco Oligarchs ( this was the phraseology of Guzman Bento ’ s time ; now they were called Blancos , and had given up the federal idea ) , which meant the families of pure Spanish descent , considered Charles as one of themselves . With such a family record , no one could be more of a Costaguanero than Don Carlos Gould ; but his aspect was so characteristic that in the talk of common people he was just the Inglez -- the Englishman of Sulaco . He looked more English than a casual tourist , a sort of heretic pilgrim , however , quite unknown in Sulaco . He looked more English than the last arrived batch of young railway engineers , than anybody out of the hunting-field pictures in the numbers of Punch reaching his wife ’ s drawing-room two months or so after date . It astonished you to hear him talk Spanish ( Castillan , as the natives say ) or the Indian dialect of the country-people so naturally . His accent had never been English ; but there was something so indelible in all these ancestral Goulds -- liberators , explorers , coffee planters , merchants , revolutionists -- of Costaguana , that he , the only representative of the third generation in a continent possessing its own style of horsemanship , went on looking thoroughly English even on horseback . This is not said of him in the mocking spirit of the Llaneros -- men of the great plains -- who think that no one in the world knows how to sit a horse but themselves . Charles Gould , to use the suitably lofty phrase , rode like a centaur . Riding for him was not a special form of exercise ; it was a natural faculty , as walking straight is to all men sound of mind and limb ; but , all the same , when cantering beside the rutty ox-cart track to the mine he looked in his English clothes and with his imported saddlery as though he had come this moment to Costaguana at his easy swift pasotrote , straight out of some green meadow at the other side of the world . His way would lie along the old Spanish road -- the Camino Real of popular speech -- the only remaining vestige of a fact and name left by that royalty old Giorgio Viola hated , and whose very shadow had departed from the land ; for the big equestrian statue of Charles IV . at the entrance of the Alameda , towering white against the trees , was only known to the folk from the country and to the beggars of the town that slept on the steps around the pedestal , as the Horse of Stone . The other Carlos , turning off to the left with a rapid clatter of hoofs on the disjointed pavement -- Don Carlos Gould , in his English clothes , looked as incongruous , but much more at home than the kingly cavalier reining in his steed on the pedestal above the sleeping leperos , with his marble arm raised towards the marble rim of a plumed hat . The weather-stained effigy of the mounted king , with its vague suggestion of a saluting gesture , seemed to present an inscrutable breast to the political changes which had robbed it of its very name ; but neither did the other horseman , well known to the people , keen and alive on his well-shaped , slate-coloured beast with a white eye , wear his heart on the sleeve of his English coat . His mind preserved its steady poise as if sheltered in the passionless stability of private and public decencies at home in Europe . He accepted with a like calm the shocking manner in which the Sulaco ladies smothered their faces with pearl powder till they looked like white plaster casts with beautiful living eyes , the peculiar gossip of the town , and the continuous political changes , the constant “ saving of the country , ” which to his wife seemed a puerile and bloodthirsty game of murder and rapine played with terrible earnestness by depraved children . In the early days of her Costaguana life , the little lady used to clench her hands with exasperation at not being able to take the public affairs of the country as seriously as the incidental atrocity of methods deserved . She saw in them a comedy of naive pretences , but hardly anything genuine except her own appalled indignation . Charles , very quiet and twisting his long moustaches , would decline to discuss them at all . Once , however , he observed to her gently -- “ My dear , you seem to forget that I was born here. ” These few words made her pause as if they had been a sudden revelation . Perhaps the mere fact of being born in the country did make a difference . She had a great confidence in her husband ; it had always been very great . He had struck her imagination from the first by his unsentimentalism , by that very quietude of mind which she had erected in her thought for a sign of perfect competency in the business of living . Don Jose Avellanos , their neighbour across the street , a statesman , a poet , a man of culture , who had represented his country at several European Courts ( and had suffered untold indignities as a state prisoner in the time of the tyrant Guzman Bento ) , used to declare in Dona Emilia ’ s drawing-room that Carlos had all the English qualities of character with a truly patriotic heart . Mrs. Gould , raising her eyes to her husband ’ s thin , red and tan face , could not detect the slightest quiver of a feature at what he must have heard said of his patriotism . Perhaps he had just dismounted on his return from the mine ; he was English enough to disregard the hottest hours of the day . Basilio , in a livery of white linen and a red sash , had squatted for a moment behind his heels to unstrap the heavy , blunt spurs in the patio ; and then the Senor Administrator would go up the staircase into the gallery . Rows of plants in pots , ranged on the balustrade between the pilasters of the arches , screened the corredor with their leaves and flowers from the quadrangle below , whose paved space is the true hearthstone of a South American house , where the quiet hours of domestic life are marked by the shifting of light and shadow on the flagstones . Senor Avellanos was in the habit of crossing the patio at five o ’ clock almost every day . Don Jose chose to come over at tea-time because the English rite at Dona Emilia ’ s house reminded him of the time he lived in London as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James . He did not like tea ; and , usually , rocking his American chair , his neat little shiny boots crossed on the foot-rest , he would talk on and on with a sort of complacent virtuosity wonderful in a man of his age , while he held the cup in his hands for a long time . His close-cropped head was perfectly white ; his eyes coalblack . On seeing Charles Gould step into the sala he would nod provisionally and go on to the end of the oratorial period . Only then he would say -- “ Carlos , my friend , you have ridden from San Tome in the heat of the day . Always the true English activity . No ? What ? ” He drank up all the tea at once in one draught . This performance was invariably followed by a slight shudder and a low , involuntary “ br-r-r-r , ” which was not covered by the hasty exclamation , “ Excellent ! ” Then giving up the empty cup into his young friend ’ s hand , extended with a smile , he continued to expatiate upon the patriotic nature of the San Tome mine for the simple pleasure of talking fluently , it seemed , while his reclining body jerked backwards and forwards in a rocking-chair of the sort exported from the United States . The ceiling of the largest drawing-room of the Casa Gould extended its white level far above his head . The loftiness dwarfed the mixture of heavy , straight-backed Spanish chairs of brown wood with leathern seats , and European furniture , low , and cushioned all over , like squat little monsters gorged to bursting with steel springs and horsehair . There were knick-knacks on little tables , mirrors let into the wall above marble consoles , square spaces of carpet under the two groups of armchairs , each presided over by a deep sofa ; smaller rugs scattered all over the floor of red tiles ; three windows from the ceiling down to the ground , opening on a balcony , and flanked by the perpendicular folds of the dark hangings . The stateliness of ancient days lingered between the four high , smooth walls , tinted a delicate primrose-colour ; and Mrs. Gould , with her little head and shining coils of hair , sitting in a cloud of muslin and lace before a slender mahogany table , resembled a fairy posed lightly before dainty philtres dispensed out of vessels of silver and porcelain . Mrs. Gould knew the history of the San Tome mine . Worked in the early days mostly by means of lashes on the backs of slaves , its yield had been paid for in its own weight of human bones . Whole tribes of Indians had perished in the exploitation ; and then the mine was abandoned , since with this primitive method it had ceased to make a profitable return , no matter how many corpses were thrown into its maw . Then it became forgotten . It was rediscovered after the War of Independence . An English company obtained the right to work it , and found so rich a vein that neither the exactions of successive governments , nor the periodical raids of recruiting officers upon the population of paid miners they had created , could discourage their perseverance . But in the end , during the long turmoil of pronunciamentos that followed the death of the famous Guzman Bento , the native miners , incited to revolt by the emissaries sent out from the capital , had risen upon their English chiefs and murdered them to a man . The decree of confiscation which appeared immediately afterwards in the Diario Official , published in Sta . Marta , began with the words : “ Justly incensed at the grinding oppression of foreigners , actuated by sordid motives of gain rather than by love for a country where they come impoverished to seek their fortunes , the mining population of San Tome , etc . . . . ” and ended with the declaration : “ The chief of the State has resolved to exercise to the full his power of clemency . The mine , which by every law , international , human , and divine , reverts now to the Government as national property , shall remain closed till the sword drawn for the sacred defence of liberal principles has accomplished its mission of securing the happiness of our beloved country. ” And for many years this was the last of the San Tome mine . What advantage that Government had expected from the spoliation , it is impossible to tell now . Costaguana was made with difficulty to pay a beggarly money compensation to the families of the victims , and then the matter dropped out of diplomatic despatches . But afterwards another Government bethought itself of that valuable asset . It was an ordinary Costaguana Government -- the fourth in six years -- but it judged of its opportunities sanely . It remembered the San Tome mine with a secret conviction of its worthlessness in their own hands , but with an ingenious insight into the various uses a silver mine can be put to , apart from the sordid process of extracting the metal from under the ground . The father of Charles Gould , for a long time one of the most wealthy merchants of Costaguana , had already lost a considerable part of his fortune in forced loans to the successive Governments . He was a man of calm judgment , who never dreamed of pressing his claims ; and when , suddenly , the perpetual concession of the San Tome mine was offered to him in full settlement , his alarm became extreme . He was versed in the ways of Governments . Indeed , the intention of this affair , though no doubt deeply meditated in the closet , lay open on the surface of the document presented urgently for his signature . The third and most important clause stipulated that the concession-holder should pay at once to the Government five years ’ royalties on the estimated output of the mine . Mr. Gould , senior , defended himself from this fatal favour with many arguments and entreaties , but without success . He knew nothing of mining ; he had no means to put his concession on the European market ; the mine as a working concern did not exist . The buildings had been burnt down , the mining plant had been destroyed , the mining population had disappeared from the neighbourhood years and years ago ; the very road had vanished under a flood of tropical vegetation as effectually as if swallowed by the sea ; and the main gallery had fallen in within a hundred yards from the entrance . It was no longer an abandoned mine ; it was a wild , inaccessible , and rocky gorge of the Sierra , where vestiges of charred timber , some heaps of smashed bricks , and a few shapeless pieces of rusty iron could have been found under the matted mass of thorny creepers covering the ground . Mr. Gould , senior , did not desire the perpetual possession of that desolate locality ; in fact , the mere vision of it arising before his mind in the still watches of the night had the power to exasperate him into hours of hot and agitated insomnia . It so happened , however , that the Finance Minister of the time was a man to whom , in years gone by , Mr. Gould had , unfortunately , declined to grant some small pecuniary assistance , basing his refusal on the ground that the applicant was a notorious gambler and cheat , besides being more than half suspected of a robbery with violence on a wealthy ranchero in a remote country district , where he was actually exercising the function of a judge . Now , after reaching his exalted position , that politician had proclaimed his intention to repay evil with good to Senor Gould -- the poor man . He affirmed and reaffirmed this resolution in the drawing-rooms of Sta . Marta , in a soft and implacable voice , and with such malicious glances that Mr. Gould ’ s best friends advised him earnestly to attempt no bribery to get the matter dropped . It would have been useless . Indeed , it would not have been a very safe proceeding . Such was also the opinion of a stout , loud-voiced lady of French extraction , the daughter , she said , of an officer of high rank ( _officier superieur de l ’ armee_ ) , who was accommodated with lodgings within the walls of a secularized convent next door to the Ministry of Finance . That florid person , when approached on behalf of Mr. Gould in a proper manner , and with a suitable present , shook her head despondently . She was good-natured , and her despondency was genuine . She imagined she could not take money in consideration of something she could not accomplish . The friend of Mr. Gould , charged with the delicate mission , used to say afterwards that she was the only honest person closely or remotely connected with the Government he had ever met . “ No go , ” she had said with a cavalier , husky intonation which was natural to her , and using turns of expression more suitable to a child of parents unknown than to the orphaned daughter of a general officer . “ No ; it ’ s no go . _Pas moyen , mon garcon . C ’ est dommage , tout de meme . Ah ! zut ! Je ne vole pas mon monde . Je ne suis pas ministre -- moi ! Vous pouvez emporter votre petit sac_. ” For a moment , biting her carmine lip , she deplored inwardly the tyranny of the rigid principles governing the sale of her influence in high places . Then , significantly , and with a touch of impatience , “ _Allez_ , ” she added , “ _et dites bien a votre bonhomme -- entendez-vous ? -- qu ’ il faut avaler la pilule_. ” After such a warning there was nothing for it but to sign and pay . Mr. Gould had swallowed the pill , and it was as though it had been compounded of some subtle poison that acted directly on his brain . He became at once mine-ridden , and as he was well read in light literature it took to his mind the form of the Old Man of the Sea fastened upon his shoulders . He also began to dream of vampires . Mr. Gould exaggerated to himself the disadvantages of his new position , because he viewed it emotionally . His position in Costaguana was no worse than before . But man is a desperately conservative creature , and the extravagant novelty of this outrage upon his purse distressed his sensibilities . Everybody around him was being robbed by the grotesque and murderous bands that played their game of governments and revolutions after the death of Guzman Bento . His experience had taught him that , however short the plunder might fall of their legitimate expectations , no gang in possession of the Presidential Palace would be so incompetent as to suffer itself to be baffled by the want of a pretext . The first casual colonel of the barefooted army of scarecrows that came along was able to expose with force and precision to any mere civilian his titles to a sum of 10,000 dollars ; the while his hope would be immutably fixed upon a gratuity , at any rate , of no less than a thousand . Mr. Gould knew that very well , and , armed with resignation , had waited for better times . But to be robbed under the forms of legality and business was intolerable to his imagination . Mr. Gould , the father , had one fault in his sagacious and honourable character : he attached too much importance to form . It is a failing common to mankind , whose views are tinged by prejudices . There was for him in that affair a malignancy of perverted justice which , by means of a moral shock , attacked his vigorous physique . “ It will end by killing me , ” he used to affirm many times a day . And , in fact , since that time he began to suffer from fever , from liver pains , and mostly from a worrying inability to think of anything else . The Finance Minister could have formed no conception of the profound subtlety of his revenge . Even Mr. Gould ’ s letters to his fourteen-year-old boy Charles , then away in England for his education , came at last to talk of practically nothing but the mine . He groaned over the injustice , the persecution , the outrage of that mine ; he occupied whole pages in the exposition of the fatal consequences attaching to the possession of that mine from every point of view , with every dismal inference , with words of horror at the apparently eternal character of that curse . For the Concession had been granted to him and his descendants for ever . He implored his son never to return to Costaguana , never to claim any part of his inheritance there , because it was tainted by the infamous Concession ; never to touch it , never to approach it , to forget that America existed , and pursue a mercantile career in Europe . And each letter ended with bitter self-reproaches for having stayed too long in that cavern of thieves , intriguers , and brigands . To be told repeatedly that one ’ s future is blighted because of the possession of a silver mine is not , at the age of fourteen , a matter of prime importance as to its main statement ; but in its form it is calculated to excite a certain amount of wonder and attention . In course of time the boy , at first only puzzled by the angry jeremiads , but rather sorry for his dad , began to turn the matter over in his mind in such moments as he could spare from play and study . In about a year he had evolved from the lecture of the letters a definite conviction that there was a silver mine in the Sulaco province of the Republic of Costaguana , where poor Uncle Harry had been shot by soldiers a great many years before . There was also connected closely with that mine a thing called the “ iniquitous Gould Concession , ” apparently written on a paper which his father desired ardently to “ tear and fling into the faces ” of presidents , members of judicature , and ministers of State . And this desire persisted , though the names of these people , he noticed , seldom remained the same for a whole year together . This desire ( since the thing was iniquitous ) seemed quite natural to the boy , though why the affair was iniquitous he did not know . Afterwards , with advancing wisdom , he managed to clear the plain truth of the business from the fantastic intrusions of the Old Man of the Sea , vampires , and ghouls , which had lent to his father ’ s correspondence the flavour of a gruesome Arabian Nights tale . In the end , the growing youth attained to as close an intimacy with the San Tome mine as the old man who wrote these plaintive and enraged letters on the other side of the sea . He had been made several times already to pay heavy fines for neglecting to work the mine , he reported , besides other sums extracted from him on account of future royalties , on the ground that a man with such a valuable concession in his pocket could not refuse his financial assistance to the Government of the Republic . The last of his fortune was passing away from him against worthless receipts , he wrote , in a rage , whilst he was being pointed out as an individual who had known how to secure enormous advantages from the necessities of his country . And the young man in Europe grew more and more interested in that thing which could provoke such a tumult of words and passion . He thought of it every day ; but he thought of it without bitterness . It might have been an unfortunate affair for his poor dad , and the whole story threw a queer light upon the social and political life of Costaguana . The view he took of it was sympathetic to his father , yet calm and reflective . His personal feelings had not been outraged , and it is difficult to resent with proper and durable indignation the physical or mental anguish of another organism , even if that other organism is one ’ s own father . By the time he was twenty Charles Gould had , in his turn , fallen under the spell of the San Tome mine . But it was another form of enchantment , more suitable to his youth , into whose magic formula there entered hope , vigour , and self-confidence , instead of weary indignation and despair . Left after he was twenty to his own guidance ( except for the severe injunction not to return to Costaguana ) , he had pursued his studies in Belgium and France with the idea of qualifying for a mining engineer . But this scientific aspect of his labours remained vague and imperfect in his mind . Mines had acquired for him a dramatic interest . He studied their peculiarities from a personal point of view , too , as one would study the varied characters of men . He visited them as one goes with curiosity to call upon remarkable persons . He visited mines in Germany , in Spain , in Cornwall . Abandoned workings had for him strong fascination . Their desolation appealed to him like the sight of human misery , whose causes are varied and profound . They might have been worthless , but also they might have been misunderstood . His future wife was the first , and perhaps the only person to detect this secret mood which governed the profoundly sensible , almost voiceless attitude of this man towards the world of material things . And at once her delight in him , lingering with half-open wings like those birds that can not rise easily from a flat level , found a pinnacle from which to soar up into the skies . They had become acquainted in Italy , where the future Mrs. Gould was staying with an old and pale aunt who , years before , had married a middle-aged , impoverished Italian marquis . She now mourned that man , who had known how to give up his life to the independence and unity of his country , who had known how to be as enthusiastic in his generosity as the youngest of those who fell for that very cause of which old Giorgio Viola was a drifting relic , as a broken spar is suffered to float away disregarded after a naval victory . The Marchesa led a still , whispering existence , nun-like in her black robes and a white band over the forehead , in a corner of the first floor of an ancient and ruinous palace , whose big , empty halls downstairs sheltered under their painted ceilings the harvests , the fowls , and even the cattle , together with the whole family of the tenant farmer . The two young people had met in Lucca . After that meeting Charles Gould visited no mines , though they went together in a carriage , once , to see some marble quarries , where the work resembled mining in so far that it also was the tearing of the raw material of treasure from the earth . Charles Gould did not open his heart to her in any set speeches . He simply went on acting and thinking in her sight . This is the true method of sincerity . One of his frequent remarks was , “ I think sometimes that poor father takes a wrong view of that San Tome business. ” And they discussed that opinion long and earnestly , as if they could influence a mind across half the globe ; but in reality they discussed it because the sentiment of love can enter into any subject and live ardently in remote phrases . For this natural reason these discussions were precious to Mrs. Gould in her engaged state . Charles feared that Mr. Gould , senior , was wasting his strength and making himself ill by his efforts to get rid of the Concession . “ I fancy that this is not the kind of handling it requires , ” he mused aloud , as if to himself . And when she wondered frankly that a man of character should devote his energies to plotting and intrigues , Charles would remark , with a gentle concern that understood her wonder , “ You must not forget that he was born there. ” She would set her quick mind to work upon that , and then make the inconsequent retort , which he accepted as perfectly sagacious , because , in fact , it was so -- “ Well , and you ? You were born there , too. ” He knew his answer . “ That ’ s different . I ’ ve been away ten years . Dad never had such a long spell ; and it was more than thirty years ago. ” She was the first person to whom he opened his lips after receiving the news of his father ’ s death . “ It has killed him ! ” he said . He had walked straight out of town with the news , straight out before him in the noonday sun on the white road , and his feet had brought him face to face with her in the hall of the ruined palazzo , a room magnificent and naked , with here and there a long strip of damask , black with damp and age , hanging down on a bare panel of the wall . It was furnished with exactly one gilt armchair , with a broken back , and an octagon columnar stand bearing a heavy marble vase ornamented with sculptured masks and garlands of flowers , and cracked from top to bottom . Charles Gould was dusty with the white dust of the road lying on his boots , on his shoulders , on his cap with two peaks . Water dripped from under it all over his face , and he grasped a thick oaken cudgel in his bare right hand . She went very pale under the roses of her big straw hat , gloved , swinging a clear sunshade , caught just as she was going out to meet him at the bottom of the hill , where three poplars stand near the wall of a vineyard . “ It has killed him ! ” he repeated . “ He ought to have had many years yet . We are a long-lived family. ” She was too startled to say anything ; he was contemplating with a penetrating and motionless stare the cracked marble urn as though he had resolved to fix its shape for ever in his memory . It was only when , turning suddenly to her , he blurted out twice , “ I ’ ve come to you -- I ’ ve come straight to you -- , ” without being able to finish his phrase , that the great pitifulness of that lonely and tormented death in Costaguana came to her with the full force of its misery . He caught hold of her hand , raised it to his lips , and at that she dropped her parasol to pat him on the cheek , murmured “ Poor boy , ” and began to dry her eyes under the downward curve of her hat-brim , very small in her simple , white frock , almost like a lost child crying in the degraded grandeur of the noble hall , while he stood by her , again perfectly motionless in the contemplation of the marble urn . Afterwards they went out for a long walk , which was silent till he exclaimed suddenly -- “ Yes . But if he had only grappled with it in a proper way ! ” And then they stopped . Everywhere there were long shadows lying on the hills , on the roads , on the enclosed fields of olive trees ; the shadows of poplars , of wide chestnuts , of farm buildings , of stone walls ; and in mid-air the sound of a bell , thin and alert , was like the throbbing pulse of the sunset glow . Her lips were slightly parted as though in surprise that he should not be looking at her with his usual expression . His usual expression was unconditionally approving and attentive . He was in his talks with her the most anxious and deferential of dictators , an attitude that pleased her immensely . It affirmed her power without detracting from his dignity . That slight girl , with her little feet , little hands , little face attractively overweighted by great coils of hair ; with a rather large mouth , whose mere parting seemed to breathe upon you the fragrance of frankness and generosity , had the fastidious soul of an experienced woman . She was , before all things and all flatteries , careful of her pride in the object of her choice . But now he was actually not looking at her at all ; and his expression was tense and irrational , as is natural in a man who elects to stare at nothing past a young girl ’ s head . “ Well , yes . It was iniquitous . They corrupted him thoroughly , the poor old boy . Oh ! why wouldn ’ t he let me go back to him ? But now I shall know how to grapple with this. ” After pronouncing these words with immense assurance , he glanced down at her , and at once fell a prey to distress , incertitude , and fear . The only thing he wanted to know now , he said , was whether she did love him enough -- whether she would have the courage to go with him so far away ? He put these questions to her in a voice that trembled with anxiety -- for he was a determined man . She did . She would . And immediately the future hostess of all the Europeans in Sulaco had the physical experience of the earth falling away from under her . It vanished completely , even to the very sound of the bell . When her feet touched the ground again , the bell was still ringing in the valley ; she put her hands up to her hair , breathing quickly , and glanced up and down the stony lane . It was reassuringly empty . Meantime , Charles , stepping with one foot into a dry and dusty ditch , picked up the open parasol , which had bounded away from them with a martial sound of drum taps . He handed it to her soberly , a little crestfallen . They turned back , and after she had slipped her hand on his arm , the first words he pronounced were -- “ It ’ s lucky that we shall be able to settle in a coast town . You ’ ve heard its name . It is Sulaco . I am so glad poor father did get that house . He bought a big house there years ago , in order that there should always be a Casa Gould in the principal town of what used to be called the Occidental Province . I lived there once , as a small boy , with my dear mother , for a whole year , while poor father was away in the United States on business . You shall be the new mistress of the Casa Gould. ” And later , in the inhabited corner of the Palazzo above the vineyards , the marble hills , the pines and olives of Lucca , he also said -- “ The name of Gould has been always highly respected in Sulaco . My uncle Harry was chief of the State for some time , and has left a great name amongst the first families . By this I mean the pure Creole families , who take no part in the miserable farce of governments . Uncle Harry was no adventurer . In Costaguana we Goulds are no adventurers . He was of the country , and he loved it , but he remained essentially an Englishman in his ideas . He made use of the political cry of his time . It was Federation . But he was no politician . He simply stood up for social order out of pure love for rational liberty and from his hate of oppression . There was no nonsense about him . He went to work in his own way because it seemed right , just as I feel I must lay hold of that mine. ” In such words he talked to her because his memory was very full of the country of his childhood , his heart of his life with that girl , and his mind of the San Tome Concession . He added that he would have to leave her for a few days to find an American , a man from San Francisco , who was still somewhere in Europe . A few months before he had made his acquaintance in an old historic German town , situated in a mining district . The American had his womankind with him , but seemed lonely while they were sketching all day long the old doorways and the turreted corners of the mediaeval houses . Charles Gould had with him the inseparable companionship of the mine . The other man was interested in mining enterprises , knew something of Costaguana , and was no stranger to the name of Gould . They had talked together with some intimacy which was made possible by the difference of their ages . Charles wanted now to find that capitalist of shrewd mind and accessible character . His father ’ s fortune in Costaguana , which he had supposed to be still considerable , seemed to have melted in the rascally crucible of revolutions . Apart from some ten thousand pounds deposited in England , there appeared to be nothing left except the house in Sulaco , a vague right of forest exploitation in a remote and savage district , and the San Tome Concession , which had attended his poor father to the very brink of the grave . He explained those things . It was late when they parted . She had never before given him such a fascinating vision of herself . All the eagerness of youth for a strange life , for great distances , for a future in which there was an air of adventure , of combat -- a subtle thought of redress and conquest , had filled her with an intense excitement , which she returned to the giver with a more open and exquisite display of tenderness . He left her to walk down the hill , and directly he found himself alone he became sober . That irreparable change a death makes in the course of our daily thoughts can be felt in a vague and poignant discomfort of mind . It hurt Charles Gould to feel that never more , by no effort of will , would he be able to think of his father in the same way he used to think of him when the poor man was alive . His breathing image was no longer in his power . This consideration , closely affecting his own identity , filled his breast with a mournful and angry desire for action . In this his instinct was unerring . Action is consolatory . It is the enemy of thought and the friend of flattering illusions . Only in the conduct of our action can we find the sense of mastery over the Fates . For his action , the mine was obviously the only field . It was imperative sometimes to know how to disobey the solemn wishes of the dead . He resolved firmly to make his disobedience as thorough ( by way of atonement ) as it well could be . The mine had been the cause of an absurd moral disaster ; its working must be made a serious and moral success . He owed it to the dead man ’ s memory . Such were the -- properly speaking -- emotions of Charles Gould . His thoughts ran upon the means of raising a large amount of capital in San Francisco or elsewhere ; and incidentally there occurred to him also the general reflection that the counsel of the departed must be an unsound guide . Not one of them could be aware beforehand what enormous changes the death of any given individual may produce in the very aspect of the world . The latest phase in the history of the mine Mrs. Gould knew from personal experience . It was in essence the history of her married life . The mantle of the Goulds ’ hereditary position in Sulaco had descended amply upon her little person ; but she would not allow the peculiarities of the strange garment to weigh down the vivacity of her character , which was the sign of no mere mechanical sprightliness , but of an eager intelligence . It must not be supposed that Mrs. Gould ’ s mind was masculine . A woman with a masculine mind is not a being of superior efficiency ; she is simply a phenomenon of imperfect differentiation -- interestingly barren and without importance . Dona Emilia ’ s intelligence being feminine led her to achieve the conquest of Sulaco , simply by lighting the way for her unselfishness and sympathy . She could converse charmingly , but she was not talkative . The wisdom of the heart having no concern with the erection or demolition of theories any more than with the defence of prejudices , has no random words at its command . The words it pronounces have the value of acts of integrity , tolerance , and compassion . A woman ’ s true tenderness , like the true virility of man , is expressed in action of a conquering kind . The ladies of Sulaco adored Mrs. Gould . “ They still look upon me as something of a monster , ” Mrs. Gould had said pleasantly to one of the three gentlemen from San Francisco she had to entertain in her new Sulaco house just about a year after her marriage . They were her first visitors from abroad , and they had come to look at the San Tome mine . She jested most agreeably , they thought ; and Charles Gould , besides knowing thoroughly what he was about , had shown himself a real hustler . These facts caused them to be well disposed towards his wife . An unmistakable enthusiasm , pointed by a slight flavour of irony , made her talk of the mine absolutely fascinating to her visitors , and provoked them to grave and indulgent smiles in which there was a good deal of deference . Perhaps had they known how much she was inspired by an idealistic view of success they would have been amazed at the state of her mind as the Spanish-American ladies had been amazed at the tireless activity of her body . She would -- in her own words -- have been for them “ something of a monster. ” However , the Goulds were in essentials a reticent couple , and their guests departed without the suspicion of any other purpose but simple profit in the working of a silver mine . Mrs. Gould had out her own carriage , with two white mules , to drive them down to the harbour , whence the Ceres was to carry them off into the Olympus of plutocrats . Captain Mitchell had snatched at the occasion of leave-taking to remark to Mrs. Gould , in a low , confidential mutter , “ This marks an epoch. ” Mrs. Gould loved the patio of her Spanish house . A broad flight of stone steps was overlooked silently from a niche in the wall by a Madonna in blue robes with the crowned child sitting on her arm . Subdued voices ascended in the early mornings from the paved well of the quadrangle , with the stamping of horses and mules led out in pairs to drink at the cistern . A tangle of slender bamboo stems drooped its narrow , blade-like leaves over the square pool of water , and the fat coachman sat muffled up on the edge , holding lazily the ends of halters in his hand . Barefooted servants passed to and fro , issuing from dark , low doorways below ; two laundry girls with baskets of washed linen ; the baker with the tray of bread made for the day ; Leonarda -- her own camerista -- bearing high up , swung from her hand raised above her raven black head , a bunch of starched under-skirts dazzlingly white in the slant of sunshine . Then the old porter would hobble in , sweeping the flagstones , and the house was ready for the day . All the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle opened into each other and into the corredor , with its wrought-iron railings and a border of flowers , whence , like the lady of the mediaeval castle , she could witness from above all the departures and arrivals of the Casa , to which the sonorous arched gateway lent an air of stately importance . She had watched her carriage roll away with the three guests from the north . She smiled . Their three arms went up simultaneously to their three hats . Captain Mitchell , the fourth , in attendance , had already begun a pompous discourse . Then she lingered . She lingered , approaching her face to the clusters of flowers here and there as if to give time to her thoughts to catch up with her slow footsteps along the straight vista of the corredor . A fringed Indian hammock from Aroa , gay with coloured featherwork , had been swung judiciously in a corner that caught the early sun ; for the mornings are cool in Sulaco . The cluster of _flor de noche buena_ blazed in great masses before the open glass doors of the reception rooms . A big green parrot , brilliant like an emerald in a cage that flashed like gold , screamed out ferociously , “ _Viva Costaguana ! _ ” then called twice mellifluously , “ Leonarda ! Leonarda ! ” in imitation of Mrs. Gould ’ s voice , and suddenly took refuge in immobility and silence . Mrs. Gould reached the end of the gallery and put her head through the door of her husband ’ s room . Charles Gould , with one foot on a low wooden stool , was already strapping his spurs . He wanted to hurry back to the mine . Mrs. Gould , without coming in , glanced about the room . One tall , broad bookcase , with glass doors , was full of books ; but in the other , without shelves , and lined with red baize , were arranged firearms : Winchester carbines , revolvers , a couple of shot-guns , and even two pairs of double-barrelled holster pistols . Between them , by itself , upon a strip of scarlet velvet , hung an old cavalry sabre , once the property of Don Enrique Gould , the hero of the Occidental Province , presented by Don Jose Avellanos , the hereditary friend of the family . Otherwise , the plastered white walls were completely bare , except for a water-colour sketch of the San Tome mountain -- the work of Dona Emilia herself . In the middle of the red-tiled floor stood two long tables littered with plans and papers , a few chairs , and a glass show-case containing specimens of ore from the mine . Mrs. Gould , looking at all these things in turn , wondered aloud why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing the prospects , the working , and the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy , whereas she could talk of the mine by the hour with her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction . And dropping her eyelids expressively , she added -- “ What do you feel about it , Charley ? ” Then , surprised at her husband ’ s silence , she raised her eyes , opened wide , as pretty as pale flowers . He had done with the spurs , and , twisting his moustache with both hands , horizontally , he contemplated her from the height of his long legs with a visible appreciation of her appearance . The consciousness of being thus contemplated pleased Mrs. Gould . “ They are considerable men , ” he said . “ I know . But have you listened to their conversation ? They don ’ t seem to have understood anything they have seen here. ” “ They have seen the mine . They have understood that to some purpose , ” Charles Gould interjected , in defence of the visitors ; and then his wife mentioned the name of the most considerable of the three . He was considerable in finance and in industry . His name was familiar to many millions of people . He was so considerable that he would never have travelled so far away from the centre of his activity if the doctors had not insisted , with veiled menaces , on his taking a long holiday . “ Mr . Holroyd ’ s sense of religion , ” Mrs. Gould pursued , “ was shocked and disgusted at the tawdriness of the dressed-up saints in the cathedral -- the worship , he called it , of wood and tinsel . But it seemed to me that he looked upon his own God as a sort of influential partner , who gets his share of profits in the endowment of churches . That ’ s a sort of idolatry . He told me he endowed churches every year , Charley. ” “ No end of them , ” said Mr. Gould , marvelling inwardly at the mobility of her physiognomy . “ All over the country . He ’ s famous for that sort of munificence. ” “ Oh , he didn ’ t boast , ” Mrs. Gould declared , scrupulously . “ I believe he ’ s really a good man , but so stupid ! A poor Chulo who offers a little silver arm or leg to thank his god for a cure is as rational and more touching. ” “ He ’ s at the head of immense silver and iron interests , ” Charles Gould observed . “ Ah , yes ! The religion of silver and iron . He ’ s a very civil man , though he looked awfully solemn when he first saw the Madonna on the staircase , who ’ s only wood and paint ; but he said nothing to me . My dear Charley , I heard those men talk among themselves . Can it be that they really wish to become , for an immense consideration , drawers of water and hewers of wood to all the countries and nations of the earth ? ” “ A man must work to some end , ” Charles Gould said , vaguely . Mrs. Gould , frowning , surveyed him from head to foot . With his riding breeches , leather leggings ( an article of apparel never before seen in Costaguana ) , a Norfolk coat of grey flannel , and those great flaming moustaches , he suggested an officer of cavalry turned gentleman farmer . This combination was gratifying to Mrs. Gould ’ s tastes . “ How thin the poor boy is ! ” she thought . “ He overworks himself. ” But there was no denying that his fine-drawn , keen red face , and his whole , long-limbed , lank person had an air of breeding and distinction . And Mrs. Gould relented . “ I only wondered what you felt , ” she murmured , gently . During the last few days , as it happened , Charles Gould had been kept too busy thinking twice before he spoke to have paid much attention to the state of his feelings . But theirs was a successful match , and he had no difficulty in finding his answer . “ The best of my feelings are in your keeping , my dear , ” he said , lightly ; and there was so much truth in that obscure phrase that he experienced towards her at the moment a great increase of gratitude and tenderness . Mrs. Gould , however , did not seem to find this answer in the least obscure . She brightened up delicately ; already he had changed his tone . “ But there are facts . The worth of the mine -- as a mine -- is beyond doubt . It shall make us very wealthy . The mere working of it is a matter of technical knowledge , which I have -- which ten thousand other men in the world have . But its safety , its continued existence as an enterprise , giving a return to men -- to strangers , comparative strangers -- who invest money in it , is left altogether in my hands . I have inspired confidence in a man of wealth and position . You seem to think this perfectly natural -- do you ? Well , I don ’ t know . I don ’ t know why I have ; but it is a fact . This fact makes everything possible , because without it I would never have thought of disregarding my father ’ s wishes . I would never have disposed of the Concession as a speculator disposes of a valuable right to a company -- for cash and shares , to grow rich eventually if possible , but at any rate to put some money at once in his pocket . No . Even if it had been feasible -- which I doubt -- I would not have done so . Poor father did not understand . He was afraid I would hang on to the ruinous thing , waiting for just some such chance , and waste my life miserably . That was the true sense of his prohibition , which we have deliberately set aside. ” They were walking up and down the corredor . Her head just reached to his shoulder . His arm , extended downwards , was about her waist . His spurs jingled slightly . “ He had not seen me for ten years . He did not know me . He parted from me for my sake , and he would never let me come back . He was always talking in his letters of leaving Costaguana , of abandoning everything and making his escape . But he was too valuable a prey . They would have thrown him into one of their prisons at the first suspicion. ” His spurred feet clinked slowly . He was bending over his wife as they walked . The big parrot , turning its head askew , followed their pacing figures with a round , unblinking eye . “ He was a lonely man . Ever since I was ten years old he used to talk to me as if I had been grown up . When I was in Europe he wrote to me every month . Ten , twelve pages every month of my life for ten years . And , after all , he did not know me ! Just think of it -- ten whole years away ; the years I was growing up into a man . He could not know me . Do you think he could ? ” Mrs. Gould shook her head negatively ; which was just what her husband had expected from the strength of the argument . But she shook her head negatively only because she thought that no one could know her Charles -- really know him for what he was but herself . The thing was obvious . It could be felt . It required no argument . And poor Mr. Gould , senior , who had died too soon to ever hear of their engagement , remained too shadowy a figure for her to be credited with knowledge of any sort whatever . “ No , he did not understand . In my view this mine could never have been a thing to sell . Never ! After all his misery I simply could not have touched it for money alone , ” Charles Gould pursued : and she pressed her head to his shoulder approvingly . These two young people remembered the life which had ended wretchedly just when their own lives had come together in that splendour of hopeful love , which to the most sensible minds appears like a triumph of good over all the evils of the earth . A vague idea of rehabilitation had entered the plan of their life . That it was so vague as to elude the support of argument made it only the stronger . It had presented itself to them at the instant when the woman ’ s instinct of devotion and the man ’ s instinct of activity receive from the strongest of illusions their most powerful impulse . The very prohibition imposed the necessity of success . It was as if they had been morally bound to make good their vigorous view of life against the unnatural error of weariness and despair . If the idea of wealth was present to them it was only in so far as it was bound with that other success . Mrs. Gould , an orphan from early childhood and without fortune , brought up in an atmosphere of intellectual interests , had never considered the aspects of great wealth . They were too remote , and she had not learned that they were desirable . On the other hand , she had not known anything of absolute want . Even the very poverty of her aunt , the Marchesa , had nothing intolerable to a refined mind ; it seemed in accord with a great grief : it had the austerity of a sacrifice offered to a noble ideal . Thus even the most legitimate touch of materialism was wanting in Mrs. Gould ’ s character . The dead man of whom she thought with tenderness ( because he was Charley ’ s father ) and with some impatience ( because he had been weak ) , must be put completely in the wrong . Nothing else would do to keep their prosperity without a stain on its only real , on its immaterial side ! Charles Gould , on his part , had been obliged to keep the idea of wealth well to the fore ; but he brought it forward as a means , not as an end . Unless the mine was good business it could not be touched . He had to insist on that aspect of the enterprise . It was his lever to move men who had capital . And Charles Gould believed in the mine . He knew everything that could be known of it . His faith in the mine was contagious , though it was not served by a great eloquence ; but business men are frequently as sanguine and imaginative as lovers . They are affected by a personality much oftener than people would suppose ; and Charles Gould , in his unshaken assurance , was absolutely convincing . Besides , it was a matter of common knowledge to the men to whom he addressed himself that mining in Costaguana was a game that could be made considerably more than worth the candle . The men of affairs knew that very well . The real difficulty in touching it was elsewhere . Against that there was an implication of calm and implacable resolution in Charles Gould ’ s very voice . Men of affairs venture sometimes on acts that the common judgment of the world would pronounce absurd ; they make their decisions on apparently impulsive and human grounds . “ Very well , ” had said the considerable personage to whom Charles Gould on his way out through San Francisco had lucidly exposed his point of view . “ Let us suppose that the mining affairs of Sulaco are taken in hand . There would then be in it : first , the house of Holroyd , which is all right ; then , Mr. Charles Gould , a citizen of Costaguana , who is also all right ; and , lastly , the Government of the Republic . So far this resembles the first start of the Atacama nitrate fields , where there was a financing house , a gentleman of the name of Edwards , and -- a Government ; or , rather , two Governments -- two South American Governments . And you know what came of it . War came of it ; devastating and prolonged war came of it , Mr. Gould . However , here we possess the advantage of having only one South American Government hanging around for plunder out of the deal . It is an advantage ; but then there are degrees of badness , and that Government is the Costaguana Government. ” Thus spoke the considerable personage , the millionaire endower of churches on a scale befitting the greatness of his native land -- the same to whom the doctors used the language of horrid and veiled menaces . He was a big-limbed , deliberate man , whose quiet burliness lent to an ample silk-faced frock-coat a superfine dignity . His hair was iron grey , his eyebrows were still black , and his massive profile was the profile of a Caesar ’ s head on an old Roman coin . But his parentage was German and Scotch and English , with remote strains of Danish and French blood , giving him the temperament of a Puritan and an insatiable imagination of conquest . He was completely unbending to his visitor , because of the warm introduction the visitor had brought from Europe , and because of an irrational liking for earnestness and determination wherever met , to whatever end directed . “ The Costaguana Government shall play its hand for all it ’ s worth -- and don ’ t you forget it , Mr. Gould . Now , what is Costaguana ? It is the bottomless pit of 10 per cent . loans and other fool investments . European capital has been flung into it with both hands for years . Not ours , though . We in this country know just about enough to keep indoors when it rains . We can sit and watch . Of course , some day we shall step in . We are bound to . But there ’ s no hurry . Time itself has got to wait on the greatest country in the whole of God ’ s Universe . We shall be giving the word for everything : industry , trade , law , journalism , art , politics , and religion , from Cape Horn clear over to Smith ’ s Sound , and beyond , too , if anything worth taking hold of turns up at the North Pole . And then we shall have the leisure to take in hand the outlying islands and continents of the earth . We shall run the world ’ s business whether the world likes it or not . The world can ’ t help it -- and neither can we , I guess. ” By this he meant to express his faith in destiny in words suitable to his intelligence , which was unskilled in the presentation of general ideas . His intelligence was nourished on facts ; and Charles Gould , whose imagination had been permanently affected by the one great fact of a silver mine , had no objection to this theory of the world ’ s future . If it had seemed distasteful for a moment it was because the sudden statement of such vast eventualities dwarfed almost to nothingness the actual matter in hand . He and his plans and all the mineral wealth of the Occidental Province appeared suddenly robbed of every vestige of magnitude . The sensation was disagreeable ; but Charles Gould was not dull . Already he felt that he was producing a favourable impression ; the consciousness of that flattering fact helped him to a vague smile , which his big interlocutor took for a smile of discreet and admiring assent . He smiled quietly , too ; and immediately Charles Gould , with that mental agility mankind will display in defence of a cherished hope , reflected that the very apparent insignificance of his aim would help him to success . His personality and his mine would be taken up because it was a matter of no great consequence , one way or another , to a man who referred his action to such a prodigious destiny . And Charles Gould was not humiliated by this consideration , because the thing remained as big as ever for him . Nobody else ’ s vast conceptions of destiny could diminish the aspect of his desire for the redemption of the San Tome mine . In comparison to the correctness of his aim , definite in space and absolutely attainable within a limited time , the other man appeared for an instant as a dreamy idealist of no importance . The great man , massive and benignant , had been looking at him thoughtfully ; when he broke the short silence it was to remark that concessions flew about thick in the air of Costaguana . Any simple soul that just yearned to be taken in could bring down a concession at the first shot . “ Our consuls get their mouths stopped with them , ” he continued , with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes . But in a moment he became grave . “ A conscientious , upright man , that cares nothing for boodle , and keeps clear of their intrigues , conspiracies , and factions , soon gets his passports . See that , Mr. Gould ? Persona non grata . That ’ s the reason our Government is never properly informed . On the other hand , Europe must be kept out of this continent , and for proper interference on our part the time is not yet ripe , I dare say . But we here -- we are not this country ’ s Government , neither are we simple souls . Your affair is all right . The main question for us is whether the second partner , and that ’ s you , is the right sort to hold his own against the third and unwelcome partner , which is one or another of the high and mighty robber gangs that run the Costaguana Government . What do you think , Mr. Gould , eh ? ” He bent forward to look steadily into the unflinching eyes of Charles Gould , who , remembering the large box full of his father ’ s letters , put the accumulated scorn and bitterness of many years into the tone of his answer -- “ As far as the knowledge of these men and their methods and their politics is concerned , I can answer for myself . I have been fed on that sort of knowledge since I was a boy . I am not likely to fall into mistakes from excess of optimism. ” “ Not likely , eh ? That ’ s all right . Tact and a stiff upper lip is what you ’ ll want ; and you could bluff a little on the strength of your backing . Not too much , though . We will go with you as long as the thing runs straight . But we won ’ t be drawn into any large trouble . This is the experiment which I am willing to make . There is some risk , and we will take it ; but if you can ’ t keep up your end , we will stand our loss , of course , and then -- we ’ ll let the thing go . This mine can wait ; it has been shut up before , as you know . You must understand that under no circumstances will we consent to throw good money after bad. ” Thus the great personage had spoken then , in his own private office , in a great city where other men ( very considerable in the eyes of a vain populace ) waited with alacrity upon a wave of his hand . And rather more than a year later , during his unexpected appearance in Sulaco , he had emphasized his uncompromising attitude with a freedom of sincerity permitted to his wealth and influence . He did this with the less reserve , perhaps , because the inspection of what had been done , and more still the way in which successive steps had been taken , had impressed him with the conviction that Charles Gould was perfectly capable of keeping up his end . “ This young fellow , ” he thought to himself , “ may yet become a power in the land. ” This thought flattered him , for hitherto the only account of this young man he could give to his intimates was -- “ My brother-in-law met him in one of these one-horse old German towns , near some mines , and sent him on to me with a letter . He ’ s one of the Costaguana Goulds , pure-bred Englishmen , but all born in the country . His uncle went into politics , was the last Provincial President of Sulaco , and got shot after a battle . His father was a prominent business man in Sta . Marta , tried to keep clear of their politics , and died ruined after a lot of revolutions . And that ’ s your Costaguana in a nutshell. ” Of course , he was too great a man to be questioned as to his motives , even by his intimates . The outside world was at liberty to wonder respectfully at the hidden meaning of his actions . He was so great a man that his lavish patronage of the “ purer forms of Christianity ” ( which in its naive form of church-building amused Mrs. Gould ) was looked upon by his fellow-citizens as the manifestation of a pious and humble spirit . But in his own circles of the financial world the taking up of such a thing as the San Tome mine was regarded with respect , indeed , but rather as a subject for discreet jocularity . It was a great man ’ s caprice . In the great Holroyd building ( an enormous pile of iron , glass , and blocks of stone at the",Nostromo A Tale Of The Seaboard
Thomas Hardy,"This eBook was produced from the 1907 Macmillan and Co. edition by Les Bowler , St. Ives , Dorset . `` Vitae post-scenia celant. '' -- Lucretius . PREFACE This somewhat frivolous narrative was produced as an interlude between stories of a more sober design , and it was given the sub-title of a comedy to indicate -- though not quite accurately -- the aim of the performance . A high degree of probability was not attempted in the arrangement of the incidents , and there was expected of the reader a certain lightness of mood , which should inform him with a good-natured willingness to accept the production in the spirit in which it was offered . The characters themselves , however , were meant to be consistent and human . On its first appearance the novel suffered , perhaps deservedly , for what was involved in these intentions -- for its quality of unexpectedness in particular -- that unforgivable sin in the critic 's sight -- the immediate precursor of 'Ethelberta ' having been a purely rural tale . Moreover , in its choice of medium , and line of perspective , it undertook a delicate task : to excite interest in a drama -- if such a dignified word may be used in the connection -- wherein servants were as important as , or more important than , their masters ; wherein the drawing-room was sketched in many cases from the point of view of the servants ' hall . Such a reversal of the social foreground has , perhaps , since grown more welcome , and readers even of the finer crusted kind may now be disposed to pardon a writer for presenting the sons and daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Chickerel as beings who come within the scope of a congenial regard .

A STREET IN ANGLEBURY -- A HEATH NEAR IT -- INSIDE THE 'RED LION ' INN Young Mrs. Petherwin stepped from the door of an old and well-appointed inn in a Wessex town to take a country walk . By her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen ; but , as a fact not generally known , her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood . She was the daughter of a gentleman who lived in a large house not his own , and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an infant of title who does not come into the story at all , having merely furnished Ethelberta 's mother with a subject of contemplation . She became teacher in a school , was praised by examiners , admired by gentlemen , not admired by gentlewomen , was touched up with accomplishments by masters who were coaxed into painstaking by her many graces , and , entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof , was stealthily married by the son . He , a minor like herself , died from a chill caught during the wedding tour , and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by Sir Ralph Petherwin , his unforgiving father , who had bequeathed his wealth to his wife absolutely . These calamities were a sufficient reason to Lady Petherwin for pardoning all concerned . She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelberta -- who seemed rather a detached bride than a widow -- and finished her education by placing her for two or three years in a boarding-school at Bonn . Latterly she had brought the girl to England to live under her roof as daughter and companion , the condition attached being that Ethelberta was never openly to recognize her relations , for reasons which will hereafter appear . The elegant young lady , as she had a full right to be called if she cared for the definition , arrested all the local attention when she emerged into the summer-evening light with that diadem-and-sceptre bearing -- many people for reasons of heredity discovering such graces only in those whose vestibules are lined with ancestral mail , forgetting that a bear may be taught to dance . While this air of hers lasted , even the inanimate objects in the street appeared to know that she was there ; but from a way she had of carelessly overthrowing her dignity by versatile moods , one could not calculate upon its presence to a certainty when she was round corners or in little lanes which demanded no repression of animal spirits . 'Well to be sure ! ' exclaimed a milkman , regarding her . 'We should freeze in our beds if 'twere not for the sun , and , dang me ! if she is n't a pretty piece . A man could make a meal between them eyes and chin -- eh , hostler ? Odd nation dang my old sides if he could n't ! ' The speaker , who had been carrying a pair of pails on a yoke , deposited them upon the edge of the pavement in front of the inn , and straightened his back to an excruciating perpendicular . His remarks had been addressed to a rickety person , wearing a waistcoat of that preternatural length from the top to the bottom button which prevails among men who have to do with horses . He was sweeping straws from the carriage-way beneath the stone arch that formed a passage to the stables behind . 'Never mind the cursing and swearing , or somebody who 's never out of hearing may clap yer name down in his black book , ' said the hostler , also pausing , and lifting his eyes to the mullioned and transomed windows and moulded parapet above him -- not to study them as features of ancient architecture , but just to give as healthful a stretch to the eyes as his acquaintance had done to his back . 'Michael , a old man like you ought to think about other things , and not be looking two ways at your time of life . Pouncing upon young flesh like a carrion crow -- 't is a vile thing in a old man . ' ''Tis ; and yet 't is not , for 't is a naterel taste , ' said the milkman , again surveying Ethelberta , who had now paused upon a bridge in full view , to look down the river . 'Now , if a poor needy feller like myself could only catch her alone when she 's dressed up to the nines for some grand party , and carry her off to some lonely place -- sakes , what a pot of jewels and goold things I warrant he 'd find about her ! 'Twould pay en for his trouble . ' ' I do n't dispute the picter ; but 't is sly and untimely to think such roguery . Though I 've had thoughts like it , 't is true , about high women -- Lord forgive me for't . ' 'And that figure of fashion standing there is a widow woman , so I hear ? ' 'Lady -- not a penny less than lady . Ay , a thing of twenty-one or thereabouts . ' ' A widow lady and twenty-one . 'T is a backward age for a body who 's so forward in her state of life . ' 'Well , be that as 'twill , here 's my showings for her age . She was about the figure of two or three-and-twenty when a ' got off the carriage last night , tired out wi ' boaming about the country ; and nineteen this morning when she came downstairs after a sleep round the clock and a clane-washed face : so I thought to myself , twenty-one , I thought . ' 'And what 's the young woman 's name , make so bold , hostler ? ' 'Ay , and the house were all in a stoor with her and the old woman , and their boxes and camp-kettles , that they carry to wash in because hand- basons bai n't big enough , and I do n't know what all ; and t'other folk stopping here were no more than dirt thencefor'ard . ' ' I suppose they 've come out of some noble city a long way herefrom ? ' 'And there was her hair up in buckle as if she 'd never seen a clay-cold man at all . However , to cut a long story short , all I know besides about 'em is that the name upon their luggage is Lady Petherwin , and she 's the widow of a city gentleman , who was a man of valour in the Lord Mayor's Show . ' 'Who 's that chap in the gaiters and pack at his back , come out of the door but now ? ' said the milkman , nodding towards a figure of that description who had just emerged from the inn and trudged off in the direction taken by the lady -- now out of sight . 'Chap in the gaiters ? Chok ' it all -- why , the father of that nobleman that you call chap in the gaiters used to be hand in glove with half the Queen 's court . ' 'What d 'ye tell o ' ? ' 'That man 's father was one of the mayor and corporation of Sandbourne , and was that familiar with men of money , that he 'd slap 'em upon the shoulder as you or I or any other poor fool would the clerk of the parish . ' ' O , what 's my lordlin 's name , make so bold , then ? ' 'Ay , the toppermost class nowadays have left off the use of wheels for the good of their constitutions , so they traipse and walk for many years up foreign hills , where you can see nothing but snow and fog , till there 's no more left to walk up ; and if they reach home alive , and ha ' n't got too old and weared out , they walk and see a little of their own parishes . So they tower about with a pack and a stick and a clane white pocket-handkerchief over their hats just as you see he 's got on his . He's been staying here a night , and is off now again . `` Young man , young man , '' I think to myself , `` if your shoulders were bent like a bandy and your knees bowed out as mine be , till there is not an inch of straight bone or gristle in 'ee , th ' wouldst n't go doing hard work for play ' a b'lieve . '' ' 'True , true , upon my song . Such a pain as I have had in my lynes all this day to be sure ; words do n't know what shipwreck I suffer in these lynes o ' mine -- that they do not ! And what was this young widow lady's maiden name , then , hostler ? Folk have been peeping after her , that's true ; but they do n't seem to know much about her family . ' 'And while I 've tended horses fifty year that other folk might straddle 'em , here I be now not a penny the better ! Often-times , when I see so many good things about , I feel inclined to help myself in common justice to my pocket . `` Work hard and be poor , Do nothing and get more . '' But I draw in the horns of my mind and think to myself , `` Forbear , John Hostler , forbear ! '' -- Her maiden name ? Faith , I do n't know the woman's maiden name , though she said to me , `` Good evening , John ; '' but I had no memory of ever seeing her afore -- no , no more than the dead inside church- hatch -- where I shall soon be likewise -- I had not . `` Ay , my nabs , '' I think to myself , `` more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows . '' ' 'More know Tom Fool -- what rambling old canticle is it you say , hostler ? ' inquired the milkman , lifting his ear . 'Let 's have it again -- a good saying well spit out is a Christmas fire to my withered heart . More know Tom Fool -- ' 'Than Tom Fool knows , ' said the hostler . 'Ah ! That 's the very feeling I 've feeled over and over again , hostler , but not in such gifted language . 'T is a thought I 've had in me for years , and never could lick into shape ! -- O-ho-ho-ho ! Splendid ! Say it again , hostler , say it again ! To hear my own poor notion that had no name brought into form like that -- I would n't ha ' lost it for the world ! More know Tom Fool than -- than -- h-ho-ho-ho-ho ! ' 'Do n't let your sense o ' vitness break out in such uproar , for heaven's sake , or folk will surely think you 've been laughing at the lady and gentleman . Well , here 's at it again -- Night t'ee , Michael . ' And the hostler went on with his sweeping . 'Night t'ee , hostler , I must move too , ' said the milkman , shouldering his yoke , and walking off ; and there reached the inn in a gradual diminuendo , as he receded up the street , shaking his head convulsively , 'More know -- Tom Fool -- than Tom Fool -- ho-ho-ho-ho-ho ! ' The 'Red Lion , ' as the inn or hotel was called which of late years had become the fashion among tourists , because of the absence from its precincts of all that was fashionable and new , stood near the middle of the town , and formed a corner where in winter the winds whistled and assembled their forces previous to plunging helter-skelter along the streets . In summer it was a fresh and pleasant spot , convenient for such quiet characters as sojourned there to study the geology and beautiful natural features of the country round . The lady whose appearance had asserted a difference between herself and the Anglebury people , without too clearly showing what that difference was , passed out of the town in a few moments and , following the highway across meadows fed by the Froom , she crossed the railway and soon got into a lonely heath . She had been watching the base of a cloud as it closed down upon the line of a distant ridge , like an upper upon a lower eyelid , shutting in the gaze of the evening sun . She was about to return before dusk came on , when she heard a commotion in the air immediately behind and above her head . The saunterer looked up and saw a wild-duck flying along with the greatest violence , just in its rear being another large bird , which a countryman would have pronounced to be one of the biggest duck-hawks that he had ever beheld . The hawk neared its intended victim , and the duck screamed and redoubled its efforts . Ethelberta impulsively started off in a rapid run that would have made a little dog bark with delight and run after , her object being , if possible , to see the end of this desperate struggle for a life so small and unheard-of . Her stateliness went away , and it could be forgiven for not remaining ; for her feet suddenly became as quick as fingers , and she raced along over the uneven ground with such force of tread that , being a woman slightly heavier than gossamer , her patent heels punched little D's in the soil with unerring accuracy wherever it was bare , crippled the heather-twigs where it was not , and sucked the swampy places with a sound of quick kisses . Her rate of advance was not to be compared with that of the two birds , though she went swiftly enough to keep them well in sight in such an open place as that around her , having at one point in the journey been so near that she could hear the whisk of the duck 's feathers against the wind as it lifted and lowered its wings . When the bird seemed to be but a few yards from its enemy she saw it strike downwards , and after a level flight of a quarter of a minute , vanish . The hawk swooped after , and Ethelberta now perceived a whitely shining oval of still water , looking amid the swarthy level of the heath like a hole through to a nether sky . Into this large pond , which the duck had been making towards from the beginning of its precipitate flight , it had dived out of sight . The excited and breathless runner was in a few moments close enough to see the disappointed hawk hovering and floating in the air as if waiting for the reappearance of its prey , upon which grim pastime it was so intent that by creeping along softly she was enabled to get very near the edge of the pool and witness the conclusion of the episode . Whenever the duck was under the necessity of showing its head to breathe , the other bird would dart towards it , invariably too late , however ; for the diver was far too experienced in the rough humour of the buzzard family at this game to come up twice near the same spot , unaccountably emerging from opposite sides of the pool in succession , and bobbing again by the time its adversary reached each place , so that at length the hawk gave up the contest and flew away , a satanic moodiness being almost perceptible in the motion of its wings . The young lady now looked around her for the first time , and began to perceive that she had run a long distance -- very much further than she had originally intended to come . Her eyes had been so long fixed upon the hawk , as it soared against the bright and mottled field of sky , that on regarding the heather and plain again it was as if she had returned to a half-forgotten region after an absence , and the whole prospect was darkened to one uniform shade of approaching night . She began at once to retrace her steps , but having been indiscriminately wheeling round the pond to get a good view of the performance , and having followed no path thither , she found the proper direction of her journey to be a matter of some uncertainty . 'Surely , ' she said to herself , ' I faced the north at starting : ' and yet on walking now with her back where her face had been set , she did not approach any marks on the horizon which might seem to signify the town . Thus dubiously , but with little real concern , she walked on till the evening light began to turn to dusk , and the shadows to darkness . Presently in front of her Ethelberta saw a white spot in the shade , and it proved to be in some way attached to the head of a man who was coming towards her out of a slight depression in the ground . It was as yet too early in the evening to be afraid , but it was too late to be altogether courageous ; and with balanced sensations Ethelberta kept her eye sharply upon him as he rose by degrees into view . The peculiar arrangement of his hat and pugree soon struck her as being that she had casually noticed on a peg in one of the rooms of the 'Red Lion , ' and when he came close she saw that his arms diminished to a peculiar smallness at their junction with his shoulders , like those of a doll , which was explained by their being girt round at that point with the straps of a knapsack that he carried behind him . Encouraged by the probability that he , like herself , was staying or had been staying at the 'Red Lion , ' she said , 'Can you tell me if this is the way back to Anglebury ? ' 'It is one way ; but the nearest is in this direction , ' said the tourist -- the same who had been criticized by the two old men . At hearing him speak all the delicate activities in the young lady's person stood still : she stopped like a clock . When she could again fence with the perception which had caused all this , she breathed . 'Mr . Julian ! ' she exclaimed . The words were uttered in a way which would have told anybody in a moment that here lay something connected with the light of other days . 'Ah , Mrs . Petherwin ! -- Yes , I am Mr. Julian -- though that can matter very little , I should think , after all these years , and what has passed . ' No remark was returned to this rugged reply , and he continued unconcernedly , 'Shall I put you in the path -- it is just here ? ' 'If you please . ' 'Come with me , then . ' She walked in silence at his heels , not a word passing between them all the way : the only noises which came from the two were the brushing of her dress and his gaiters against the heather , or the smart rap of a stray flint against his boot . They had now reached a little knoll , and he turned abruptly : 'That is Anglebury -- just where you see those lights . The path down there is the one you must follow ; it leads round the hill yonder and directly into the town . ' 'Thank you , ' she murmured , and found that he had never removed his eyes from her since speaking , keeping them fixed with mathematical exactness upon one point in her face . She moved a little to go on her way ; he moved a little less -- to go on his . 'Good-night , ' said Mr. Julian . The moment , upon the very face of it , was critical ; and yet it was one of those which have to wait for a future before they acquire a definite character as good or bad . Thus much would have been obvious to any outsider ; it may have been doubly so to Ethelberta , for she gave back more than she had got , replying , 'Good-bye -- if you are going to say no more . ' Then in struck Mr. Julian : 'What can I say ? You are nothing to me . . . . I could forgive a woman doing anything for spite , except marrying for spite . ' 'The connection of that with our present meeting does not appear , unless it refers to what you have done . It does not refer to me . ' ' I am not married : you are . ' She did not contradict him , as she might have done . 'Christopher , ' she said at last , 'this is how it is : you knew too much of me to respect me , and too little to pity me . A half knowledge of another 's life mostly does injustice to the life half known . ' 'Then since circumstances forbid my knowing you more , I must do my best to know you less , and elevate my opinion of your nature by forgetting what it consists in , ' he said in a voice from which all feeling was polished away . 'If I did not know that bitterness had more to do with those words than judgment , I -- should be -- bitter too ! You never knew half about me ; you only knew me as a governess ; you little think what my beginnings were . ' ' I have guessed . I have many times told myself that your early life was superior to your position when I first met you . I think I may say without presumption that I recognize a lady by birth when I see her , even under reverses of an extreme kind . And certainly there is this to be said , that the fact of having been bred in a wealthy home does slightly redeem an attempt to attain to such a one again . ' Ethelberta smiled a smile of many meanings . 'However , we are wasting words , ' he resumed cheerfully . 'It is better for us to part as we met , and continue to be the strangers that we have become to each other . I owe you an apology for having been betrayed into more feeling than I had a right to show , and let us part friends . Good night , Mrs. Petherwin , and success to you . We may meet again , some day , I hope . ' 'Good night , ' she said , extending her hand . He touched it , turned about , and in a short time nothing remained of him but quick regular brushings against the heather in the deep broad shadow of the moor . Ethelberta slowly moved on in the direction that he had pointed out . This meeting had surprised her in several ways . First , there was the conjuncture itself ; but more than that was the fact that he had not parted from her with any of the tragic resentment that she had from time to time imagined for that scene if it ever occurred . Yet there was really nothing wonderful in this : it is part of the generous nature of a bachelor to be not indisposed to forgive a portionless sweetheart who , by marrying elsewhere , has deprived him of the bliss of being obliged to marry her himself . Ethelberta would have been disappointed quite had there not been a comforting development of exasperation in the middle part of his talk ; but after all it formed a poor substitute for the loving hatred she had expected . When she reached the hotel the lamp over the door showed a face a little flushed , but the agitation which at first had possessed her was gone to a mere nothing . In the hall she met a slender woman wearing a silk dress of that peculiar black which in sunlight proclaims itself to have once seen better days as a brown , and days even better than those as a lavender , green , or blue . 'Menlove , ' said the lady , 'did you notice if any gentleman observed and followed me when I left the hotel to go for a walk this evening ? ' The lady's-maid , thus suddenly pulled up in a night forage after lovers , put a hand to her forehead to show that there was no mistake about her having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect , and said at last , 'You once told me , ma'am , if you recollect , that when you were dressed , I was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round for sale . ' 'Yes , so I did . ' 'So I did n't see if anybody followed you this evening . ' 'Then did you hear any gentleman arrive here by the late train last night ? ' ' O no , ma'am -- how could I ? ' said Mrs. Menlove -- an exclamation which was more apposite than her mistress suspected , considering that the speaker , after retiring from duty , had slipped down her dark skirt to reveal a light , puffed , and festooned one , put on a hat and feather , together with several pennyweights of metal in the form of rings , brooches , and earrings -- all in a time whilst one could count a hundred -- and enjoyed half-an-hour of prime courtship by an honourable young waiter of the town , who had proved constant as the magnet to the pole for the space of the day and a half that she had known him . Going at once upstairs , Ethelberta ran down the passage , and after some hesitation softly opened the door of the sitting-room in the best suite of apartments that the inn could boast of . In this room sat an elderly lady writing by the light of two candles with green shades . Well knowing , as it seemed , who the intruder was , she continued her occupation , and her visitor advanced and stood beside the table . The old lady wore her spectacles low down her cheek , her glance being depressed to about the slope of her straight white nose in order to look through them . Her mouth was pursed up to almost a youthful shape as she formed the letters with her pen , and a slight move of the lip accompanied every downstroke . There were two large antique rings on her forefinger , against which the quill rubbed in moving backwards and forwards , thereby causing a secondary noise rivalling the primary one of the nib upon the paper . 'Mamma , ' said the younger lady , 'here I am at last . ' A writer 's mind in the midst of a sentence being like a ship at sea , knowing no rest or comfort till safely piloted into the harbour of a full stop , Lady Petherwin just replied with 'What , ' in an occupied tone , not rising to interrogation . After signing her name to the letter , she raised her eyes . 'Why , how late you are , Ethelberta , and how heated you look ! ' she said . ' I have been quite alarmed about you . What do you say has happened ? ' The great , chief , and altogether eclipsing thing that had happened was the accidental meeting with an old lover whom she had once quarrelled with ; and Ethelberta 's honesty would have delivered the tidings at once , had not , unfortunately , all the rest of her attributes been dead against that act , for the old lady 's sake even more than for her own . ' I saw a great cruel bird chasing a harmless duck ! ' she exclaimed innocently . 'And I ran after to see what the end of it would be -- much further than I had any idea of going . However , the duck came to a pond , and in running round it to see the end of the fight , I could not remember which way I had come . ' 'Mercy ! ' said her mother-in-law , lifting her large eyelids , heavy as window-shutters , and spreading out her fingers like the horns of a snail . 'You might have sunk up to your knees and got lost in that swampy place -- such a time of night , too . What a tomboy you are ! And how did you find your way home after all ! ' ' O , some man showed me the way , and then I had no difficulty , and after that I came along leisurely . ' ' I thought you had been running all the way ; you look so warm . ' 'It is a warm evening . . . . Yes , and I have been thinking of old times as I walked along , ' she said , 'and how people 's positions in life alter . Have I not heard you say that while I was at Bonn , at school , some family that we had known had their household broken up when the father died , and that the children went away you did n't know where ? ' 'Do you mean the Julians ? ' 'Yes , that was the name . ' 'Why , of course you know it was the Julians . Young Julian had a day or two 's fancy for you one summer , had he not ? -- just after you came to us , at the same time , or just before it , that my poor boy and you were so desperately attached to each other . ' ' O yes , I recollect , ' said Ethelberta . 'And he had a sister , I think . I wonder where they went to live after the family collapse . ' ' I do not know , ' said Lady Petherwin , taking up another sheet of paper . ' I have a dim notion that the son , who had been brought up to no profession , became a teacher of music in some country town -- music having always been his hobby . But the facts are not very distinct in my memory . ' And she dipped her pen for another letter . Ethelberta , with a rather fallen countenance , then left her mother-in- law , and went where all ladies are supposed to go when they want to torment their minds in comfort -- to her own room . Here she thoughtfully sat down awhile , and some time later she rang for her maid . 'Menlove , ' she said , without looking towards a rustle and half a footstep that had just come in at the door , but leaning back in her chair and speaking towards the corner of the looking-glass , 'will you go down and find out if any gentleman named Julian has been staying in this house ? Get to know it , I mean , Menlove , not by directly inquiring ; you have ways of getting to know things , have you not ? If the devoted George were here now , he would help -- ' 'George was nothing to me , ma'am . ' 'James , then . ' 'And I only had James for a week or ten days : when I found he was a married man , I encouraged his addresses very little indeed . ' 'If you had encouraged him heart and soul , you could n't have fumed more at the loss of him . But please to go and make that inquiry , will you , Menlove ? ' In a few minutes Ethelberta 's woman was back again . ' A gentleman of that name stayed here last night , and left this afternoon . ' 'Will you find out his address ? ' Now the lady's-maid had already been quick-witted enough to find out that , and indeed all about him ; but it chanced that a fashionable illustrated weekly paper had just been sent from the bookseller 's , and being in want of a little time to look it over before it reached her mistress 's hands , Mrs. Menlove retired , as if to go and ask the question -- to stand meanwhile under the gas-lamp in the passage , inspecting the fascinating engravings . But as time will not wait for tire-women , a natural length of absence soon elapsed , and she returned again and said , 'His address is , Upper Street , Sandbourne . ' 'Thank you , that will do , ' replied her mistress . The hour grew later , and that dreamy period came round when ladies' fancies , that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day , begin to assert themselves anew . At this time a good guess at Ethelberta's thoughts might have been made from her manner of passing the minutes away . Instead of reading , entering notes in her diary , or doing any ordinary thing , she walked to and fro , curled her pretty nether lip within her pretty upper one a great many times , made a cradle of her locked fingers , and paused with fixed eyes where the walls of the room set limits upon her walk to look at nothing but a picture within her mind . 2 . CHRISTOPHER 'S HOUSE -- SANDBOURNE TOWN -- SANDBOURNE MOOR During the wet autumn of the same year , the postman passed one morning as usual into a plain street that ran through the less fashionable portion of Sandbourne , a modern coast town and watering-place not many miles from the ancient Anglebury . He knocked at the door of a flat-faced brick house , and it was opened by a slight , thoughtful young man , with his hat on , just then coming out . The postman put into his hands a book packet , addressed , 'Christopher Julian , Esq . ' Christopher took the package upstairs , opened it with curiosity , and discovered within a green volume of poems , by an anonymous writer , the title-page bearing the inscription , 'Metres by E. ' The book was new , though it was cut , and it appeared to have been looked into . The young man , after turning it over and wondering where it came from , laid it on the table and went his way , being in haste to fulfil his engagements for the day . In the evening , on returning home from his occupations , he sat himself down cosily to read the newly-arrived volume . The winds of this uncertain season were snarling in the chimneys , and drops of rain spat themselves into the fire , revealing plainly that the young man 's room was not far enough from the top of the house to admit of a twist in the flue , and revealing darkly a little more , if that social rule-of-three inverse , the higher in lodgings the lower in pocket , were applicable here . However , the aspect of the room , though homely , was cheerful , a somewhat contradictory group of furniture suggesting that the collection consisted of waifs and strays from a former home , the grimy faces of the old articles exercising a curious and subduing effect on the bright faces of the new . An oval mirror of rococo workmanship , and a heavy cabinet-piano with a cornice like that of an Egyptian temple , adjoined a harmonium of yesterday , and a harp that was almost as new . Printed music of the last century , and manuscript music of the previous evening , lay there in such quantity as to endanger the tidiness of a retreat which was indeed only saved from a chronic state of litter by a pair of hands that sometimes played , with the lightness of breezes , about the sewing-machine standing in a remote corner -- if any corner could be called remote in a room so small . Fire lights and shades from the shaking flames struck in a butterfly flutter on the underparts of the mantelshelf , and upon the reader 's cheek as he sat . Presently , and all at once , a much greater intentness pervaded his face : he turned back again , and read anew the subject that had arrested his eyes . He was a man whose countenance varied with his mood , though it kept somewhat in the rear of that mood . He looked sad when he felt almost serene , and only serene when he felt quite cheerful . It is a habit people acquire who have had repressing experiences . A faint smile and flush now lightened his face , and jumping up he opened the door and exclaimed , 'Faith ! will you come here for a moment ? ' A prompt step was heard on the stairs , and the young person addressed as Faith entered the room . She was small in figure , and bore less in the form of her features than in their shades when changing from expression to expression the evidence that she was his sister . 'Faith -- I want your opinion . But , stop , read this first . ' He laid his finger upon a page in the book , and placed it in her hand . The girl drew from her pocket a little green-leather sheath , worn at the edges to whity-brown , and out of that a pair of spectacles , unconsciously looking round the room for a moment as she did so , as if to ensure that no stranger saw her in the act of using them . Here a weakness was uncovered at once ; it was a small , pretty , and natural one ; indeed , as weaknesses go in the great world , it might almost have been called a commendable trait . She then began to read , without sitting down . These 'Metres by E. ' composed a collection of soft and marvellously musical rhymes , of a nature known as the vers de societe . The lines presented a series of playful defences of the supposed strategy of womankind in fascination , courtship , and marriage -- the whole teeming with ideas bright as mirrors and just as unsubstantial , yet forming a brilliant argument to justify the ways of girls to men . The pervading characteristic of the mass was the means of forcing into notice , by strangeness of contrast , the single mournful poem that the book contained . This was the piece which had arrested Christopher 's attention , and had been pointed out by him to his sister Faith . 'It is very touching , ' she said , looking up . 'What do you think I suspect about it -- that the poem is addressed to me ! Do you remember , when father was alive and we were at Solentsea that season , about a governess who came there with a Sir Ralph Petherwin and his wife , people with a sickly little daughter and a grown-up son ? ' ' I never saw any of them . I think I remember your knowing something about a young man of that name . ' 'Yes , that was the family . Well , the governess there was a very attractive woman , and somehow or other I got more interested in her than I ought to have done ( this is necessary to the history ) , and we used to meet in romantic places -- and -- and that kind of thing , you know . The end of it was , she jilted me and married the son . ' 'You were anxious to get away from Solentsea . ' 'Was I ? Then that was chiefly the reason . Well , I decided to think no more of her , and I was helped to do it by the troubles that came upon us shortly afterwards ; it is a blessed arrangement that one does not feel a sentimental grief at all when additional grief comes in the shape of practical misfortune . However , on the first afternoon of the little holiday I took for my walking tour last summer , I came to Anglebury , and stayed about the neighbourhood for a day or two to see what it was like , thinking we might settle there if this place failed us . The next evening I left , and walked across the heath to Flychett -- that 's a village about five miles further on -- so as to be that distance on my way for next morning ; and while I was crossing the heath there I met this very woman . We talked a little , because we could n't help it -- you may imagine the kind of talk it was -- and parted as coolly as we had met . Now this strange book comes to me ; and I have a strong conviction that she is the writer of it , for that poem sketches a similar scene -- or rather suggests it ; and the tone generally seems the kind of thing she would write -- not that she was a sad woman , either . ' 'She seems to be a warm-hearted , impulsive woman , to judge from these tender verses . ' 'People who print very warm words have sometimes very cold manners . I wonder if it is really her writing , and if she has sent it to me ! ' 'Would it not be a singular thing for a married woman to do ? Though of course ' -- ( she removed her spectacles as if they hindered her from thinking , and hid them under the timepiece till she should go on reading ) -- 'of course poets have morals and manners of their own , and custom is no argument with them . I am sure I would not have sent it to a man for the world ! ' ' I do not see any absolute harm in her sending it . Perhaps she thinks that , since it is all over , we may as well die friends . ' 'If I were her husband I should have doubts about the dying . And `` all over '' may not be so plain to other people as it is to you . ' 'Perhaps not . And when a man checks all a woman 's finer sentiments towards him by marrying her , it is only natural that it should find a vent somewhere . However , she probably does not know of my downfall since father 's death . I hardly think she would have cared to do it had she known that . ( I am assuming that it is Ethelberta -- Mrs. Petherwin -- who sends it : of course I am not sure . ) We must remember that when I knew her I was a gentleman at ease , who had not the least notion that I should have to work for a living , and not only so , but should have first to invent a profession to work at out of my old tastes . ' 'Kit , you have made two mistakes in your thoughts of that lady . Even though I do n't know her , I can show you that . Now I 'll tell you ! the first is in thinking that a married lady would send the book with that poem in it without at any rate a slight doubt as to its propriety : the second is in supposing that , had she wished to do it , she would have given the thing up because of our misfortunes . With a true woman the second reason would have had no effect had she once got over the first . I 'm a woman , and that 's why I know . ' Christopher said nothing , and turned over the poems . * * * * * He lived by teaching music , and , in comparison with starving , thrived ; though the wealthy might possibly have said that in comparison with thriving he starved . During this night he hummed airs in bed , thought he would do for the ballad of the fair poetess what other musicians had done for the ballads of other fair poetesses , and dreamed that she smiled on him as her prototype Sappho smiled on Phaon . The next morning before starting on his rounds a new circumstance induced him to direct his steps to the bookseller 's , and ask a question . He had found on examining the wrapper of the volume that it was posted in his own town . 'No copy of the book has been sold by me , ' the bookseller 's voice replied from far up the Alpine height of the shop-ladder , where he stood dusting stale volumes , as was his habit of a morning before customers came . ' I have never heard of it -- probably never shall ; ' and he shook out the duster , so as to hit the delicate mean between stifling Christopher and not stifling him . 'Surely you do n't live by your shop ? ' said Christopher , drawing back . The bookseller 's eyes rested on the speaker 's ; his face changed ; he came down and placed his hand on the lapel of Christopher 's coat . 'Sir , ' he said , 'country bookselling is a miserable , impoverishing , exasperating thing in these days . Can you understand the rest ? ' ' I can ; I forgive a starving man anything , ' said Christopher . 'You go a long way very suddenly , ' said the book seller . 'Half as much pity would have seemed better . However , wait a moment . ' He looked into a list of new books , and added : 'The work you allude to was only published last week ; though , mind you , if it had been published last century I might not have sold a copy . ' Although his time was precious , Christopher had now become so interested in the circumstance that the unseen sender was somebody breathing his own atmosphere , possibly the very writer herself -- the book being too new to be known -- that he again passed through the blue shadow of the spire which stretched across the street to-day , and went towards the post-office , animated by a bright intention -- to ask the postmaster if he knew the handwriting in which the packet was addressed . Now the postmaster was an acquaintance of Christopher 's , but , as regarded putting that question to him , there was a difficulty . Everything turned upon whether the postmaster at the moment of asking would be in his under- government manner , or in the manner with which mere nature had endowed him . In the latter case his reply would be all that could be wished ; in the former , a man who had sunk in society might as well put his tongue into a mousetrap as make an inquiry so obviously outside the pale of legality as was this . So he postponed his business for the present , and refrained from entering till he passed by after dinner , when pleasant malt liquor , of that capacity for cheering which is expressed by four large letter X's marching in a row , had refilled the globular trunk of the postmaster and neutralized some of the effects of officiality . The time was well chosen , but the inquiry threatened to prove fruitless : the postmaster had never , to his knowledge , seen the writing before . Christopher was turning away when a clerk in the background looked up and stated that some young lady had brought a packet with such an address upon it into the office two days earlier to get it stamped . 'Do you know her ? ' said Christopher . ' I have seen her about the neighbourhood . She goes by every morning ; I think she comes into the town from beyond the common , and returns again between four and five in the afternoon . ' 'What does she wear ? ' ' A white wool jacket with zigzags of black braid . ' Christopher left the post-office and went his way . Among his other pupils there were two who lived at some distance from Sandbourne -- one of them in the direction indicated as that habitually taken by the young person ; and in the afternoon , as he returned homeward , Christopher loitered and looked around . At first he could see nobody ; but when about a mile from the outskirts of the town he discerned a light spot ahead of him , which actually turned out to be the jacket alluded to . In due time he met the wearer face to face ; she was not Ethelberta Petherwin -- quite a different sort of individual . He had long made up his mind that this would be the case , yet he was in some indescribable way disappointed . Of the two classes into which gentle young women naturally divide , those who grow red at their weddings , and those who grow pale , the present one belonged to the former class . She was an April-natured , pink-cheeked girl , with eyes that would have made any jeweller in England think of his trade -- one who evidently took her day in the daytime , frequently caught the early worm , and had little to do with yawns or candlelight . She came and passed him ; he fancied that her countenance changed . But one may fancy anything , and the pair receded each from each without turning their heads . He could not speak to her , plain and simple as she seemed . It is rarely that a man who can be entered and made to throb by the channel of his ears is not open to a similar attack through the channel of his eyes -- for many doors will admit to one mansion -- allowance being made for the readier capacity of chosen and practised organs . Hence the beauties , concords , and eloquences of the female form were never without their effect upon Christopher , a born musician , artist , poet , seer , mouthpiece -- whichever a translator of Nature 's oracles into simple speech may be called . The young girl who had gone by was fresh and pleasant ; moreover , she was a sort of mysterious link between himself and the past , which these things were vividly reviving in him . The following week Christopher met her again . She had not much dignity , he had not much reserve , and the sudden resolution to have a holiday which sometimes impels a plump heart to rise up against a brain that overweights it was not to be resisted . He just lifted his hat , and put the only question he could think of as a beginning : 'Have I the pleasure of addressing the author of a book of very melodious poems that was sent me the other day ? ' The girl 's forefinger twirled rapidly the loop of braid that it had previously been twirling slowly , and drawing in her breath , she said , 'No , sir . ' 'The sender , then ? ' 'Yes . ' She somehow presented herself as so insignificant by the combined effect of the manner and the words that Christopher lowered his method of address to her level at once . 'Ah , ' he said , 'such an atmosphere as the writer of `` Metres by E. '' seems to breathe would soon spoil cheeks that are fresh and round as lady-apples -- eh , little girl ? But are you disposed to tell me that writer 's name ? ' By applying a general idea to a particular case a person with the best of intentions may find himself immediately landed in a quandary . In saying to the country girl before him what would have suited the mass of country lasses well enough , Christopher had offended her beyond the cure of compliment . ' I am not disposed to tell the writer 's name , ' she replied , with a dudgeon that was very great for one whose whole stock of it was a trifle . And she passed on and left him standing alone . Thus further conversation was checked ; but , through having rearranged the hours of his country lessons , Christopher met her the next Wednesday , and the next Friday , and throughout the following week -- no further words passing between them . For a while she went by very demurely , apparently mindful of his offence . But effrontery is not proved to be part of a man 's nature till he has been guilty of a second act : the best of men may commit a first through accident or ignorance -- may even be betrayed into it by over-zeal for experiment . Some such conclusion may or may not have been arrived at by the girl with the lady-apple cheeks ; at any rate , after the lapse of another week a new spectacle presented itself ; her redness deepened whenever Christopher passed her by , and embarrassment pervaded her from the lowest stitch to the tip of her feather . She had little chance of escaping him by diverging from the road , for a figure could be seen across the open ground to the distance of half a mile on either side . One day as he drew near as usual , she met him as women meet a cloud of dust -- she turned and looked backwards till he had passed . This would have been disconcerting but for one reason : Christopher was ceasing to notice her . He was a man who often , when walking abroad , and looking as it were at the scene before his eyes , discerned successes and failures , friends and relations , episodes of childhood , wedding feasts and funerals , the landscape suffering greatly by these visions , until it became no more than the patterned wall-tints about the paintings in a gallery ; something necessary to the tone , yet not regarded . Nothing but a special concentration of himself on externals could interrupt this habit , and now that her appearance along the way had changed from a chance to a custom he began to lapse again into the old trick . He gazed once or twice at her form without seeing it : he did not notice that she trembled . He sometimes read as he walked , and book in hand he frequently approached her now . This went on till six weeks had passed from the time of their first encounter . Latterly might have been once or twice heard , when he had moved out of earshot , a sound like a small gasping sigh ; but no arrangements were disturbed , and Christopher continued to keep down his eyes as persistently as a saint in a church window . The last day of his engagement had arrived , and with it the last of his walks that way . On his final return he carried in his hand a bunch of flowers which had been presented to him at the country-house where his lessons were given . He was taking them home to his sister Faith , who prized the lingering blossoms of the seeding season . Soon appeared as usual his fellow-traveller ; whereupon Christopher looked down upon his nosegay . 'Sweet simple girl , ' he thought , ' I 'll endeavour to make peace with her by means of these flowers before we part for good . ' When she came up he held them out to her and said , 'Will you allow me to present you with these ? ' The bright colours of the nosegay instantly attracted the girl's hand -- perhaps before there had been time for thought to thoroughly construe the position ; for it happened that when her arm was stretched into the air she steadied it quickly , and stood with the pose of a statue -- rigid with uncertainty . But it was too late to refuse : Christopher had put the nosegay within her fingers . Whatever pleasant expression of thanks may have appeared in her eyes fell only on the bunch of flowers , for during the whole transaction they reached to no higher level than that . To say that he was coming no more seemed scarcely necessary under the circumstances , and wishing her 'Good afternoon ' very heartily , he passed on . He had learnt by this time her occupation , which was that of pupil-teacher at one of the schools in the town , whither she walked daily from a village near . If he had not been poor and the little teacher humble , Christopher might possibly have been tempted to inquire more briskly about her , and who knows how such a pursuit might have ended ? But hard externals rule volatile sentiment , and under these untoward influences the girl and the book and the truth about its author were matters upon which he could not afford to expend much time . All Christopher did was to think now and then of the pretty innocent face and round deep eyes , not once wondering if the mind which enlivened them ever thought of him . 3 . SANDBOURNE MOOR ( continued ) It was one of those hostile days of the year when chatterbox ladies remain miserably in their homes to save the carriage and harness , when clerks ' wives hate living in lodgings , when vehicles and people appear in the street with duplicates of themselves underfoot , when bricklayers , slaters , and other out-door journeymen sit in a shed and drink beer , when ducks and drakes play with hilarious delight at their own family game , or spread out one wing after another in the slower enjoyment of letting the delicious moisture penetrate to their innermost down . The smoke from the flues of Sandbourne had barely strength enough to emerge into the drizzling rain , and hung down the sides of each chimney-pot like the streamer of a becalmed ship ; and a troop of rats might have rattled down the pipes from roof to basement with less noise than did the water that day . On the broad moor beyond the town , where Christopher 's meetings with the teacher had so regularly occurred , were a stream and some large pools ; and beside one of these , near some hatches and a weir , stood a little square building , not much larger inside than the Lord Mayor 's coach . It was known simply as 'The Weir House . ' On this wet afternoon , which was the one following the day of Christopher 's last lesson over the plain , a nearly invisible smoke came from the puny chimney of the hut . Though the door was closed , sounds of chatting and mirth fizzed from the interior , and would have told anybody who had come near -- which nobody did -- that the usually empty shell was tenanted to-day . The scene within was a large fire in a fireplace to which the whole floor of the house was no more than a hearthstone . The occupants were two gentlemanly persons , in shooting costume , who had been traversing the moor for miles in search of wild duck and teal , a waterman , and a small spaniel . In the corner stood their guns , and two or three wild mallards , which represented the scanty product of their morning 's labour , the iridescent necks of the dead birds replying to every flicker of the fire . The two sportsmen were smoking , and their man was mostly occupying himself in poking and stirring the fire with a stick : all three appeared to be pretty well wetted . One of the gentlemen , by way of varying the not very exhilarating study of four brick walls within microscopic distance of his eye , turned to a small square hole which admitted light and air to the hut , and looked out upon the dreary prospect before him . The wide concave of cloud , of the monotonous hue of dull pewter , formed an unbroken hood over the level from horizon to horizon ; beneath it , reflecting its wan lustre , was the glazed high-road which stretched , hedgeless and ditchless , past a directing-post where another road joined it , and on to the less regular ground beyond , lying like a riband unrolled across the scene , till it vanished over the furthermost undulation . Beside the pools were occasional tall sheaves of flags and sedge , and about the plain a few bushes , these forming the only obstructions to a view otherwise unbroken . The sportsman 's attention was attracted by a figure in a state of gradual enlargement as it approached along the road . ' I should think that if pleasure ca n't tempt a native out of doors to- day , business will never force him out , ' he observed . 'There is , for the first time , somebody coming along the road . ' 'If business do n't drag him out pleasure 'll never tempt en , is more like our nater in these parts , sir , ' said the man , who was looking into the fire . The conversation showed no vitality , and down it dropped dead as before , the man who was standing up continuing to gaze into the moisture . What had at first appeared as an epicene shape the decreasing space resolved into a cloaked female under an umbrella : she now relaxed her pace , till , reaching the directing-post where the road branched into two , she paused and looked about her . Instead of coming further she slowly retraced her steps for about a hundred yards . 'That 's an appointment , ' said the first speaker , as he removed the cigar from his lips ; 'and by the lords , what a day and place for an appointment with a woman ! ' 'What 's an appointment ? ' inquired his friend , a town young man , with a Tussaud complexion and well-pencilled brows half way up his forehead , so that his upper eyelids appeared to possess the uncommon quality of tallness . 'Look out here , and you 'll see . By that directing-post , where the two roads meet . As a man devoted to art , Ladywell , who has had the honour of being hung higher up on the Academy walls than any other living painter , you should take out your sketch-book and dash off the scene . ' Where nothing particular is going on , one incident makes a drama ; and , interested in that proportion , the art-sportsman puts up his eyeglass ( a form he adhered to before firing at game that had risen , by which merciful arrangement the bird got safe off ) , placed his face beside his companion 's , and also peered through the opening . The young pupil-teacher -- for she was the object of their scrutiny -- re-approached the spot whereon she had been accustomed for the last many weeks of her journey home to meet Christopher , now for the first time missing , and again she seemed reluctant to pass the hand-post , for that marked the point where the chance of seeing him ended . She glided backwards as before , this time keeping her face still to the front , as if trying to persuade the world at large , and her own shamefacedness , that she had not yet approached the place at all . 'Query , how long will she wait for him ( for it is a man to a certainty ) ? ' resumed the elder of the smokers , at the end of several minutes of silence , when , full of vacillation and doubt , she became lost to view behind some bushes . 'Will she reappear ? ' The smoking went on , and up she came into open ground as before , and walked by . ' I wonder who the girl is , to come to such a place in this weather ? There she is again , ' said the young man called Ladywell . 'Some cottage lass , not yet old enough to make the most of the value set on her by her follower , small as that appears to be . Now we may get an idea of the hour named by the fellow for the appointment , for , depend upon it , the time when she first came -- about five minutes ago -- was the time he should have been there . It is now getting on towards five -- half- past four was doubtless the time mentioned . ' 'She 's not come o ' purpose : 't is her way home from school every day , ' said the waterman . 'An experiment on woman 's endurance and patience under neglect . Two to one against her staying a quarter of an hour . ' 'The same odds against her not staying till five would be nearer probability . What 's half-an-hour to a girl in love ? ' 'On a moorland in wet weather it is thirty perceptible minutes to any fireside man , woman , or beast in Christendom -- minutes that can be felt , like the Egyptian plague of darkness . Now , little girl , go home : he is not worth it . ' Twenty minutes passed , and the girl returned miserably to the hand-post , still to wander back to her retreat behind the sedge , and lead any chance comer from the opposite quarter to believe that she had not yet reached this ultimate point beyond which a meeting with Christopher was impossible . 'Now you 'll find that she means to wait the complete half-hour , and then off she goes with a broken heart . ' All three now looked through the hole to test the truth of the prognostication . The hour of five completed itself on their watches ; the girl again came forward . And then the three in ambuscade could see her pull out her handkerchief and place it to her eyes . 'She 's grieving now because he has not come . Poor little woman , what a brute he must be ; for a broken heart in a woman means a broken vow in a man , as I infer from a thousand instances in experience , romance , and history . Do n't open the door till she is gone , Ladywell ; it will only disturb her . ' As they had guessed , the pupil-teacher , hearing the distant town-clock strike the hour , gave way to her fancy no longer , and launched into the diverging path . This lingering for Christopher 's arrival had , as is known , been founded on nothing more of the nature of an assignation than lay in his regular walk along the plain at that time every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday of the six previous weeks . It must be said that he was very far indeed from divining that his injudicious peace-offering of the flowers had stirred into life such a wearing , anxious , hopeful , despairing solicitude as this , which had been latent for some time during his constant meetings with the little stranger . She vanished in the mist towards the left , and the loiterers in the hut began to move and open the door , remarking , 'Now then for Wyndway House , a change of clothes , and a dinner . ' 4 . SANDBOURNE PIER -- ROAD TO WYNDWAY -- BALL-ROOM IN WYNDWAY HOUSE The last light of a winter day had gone down behind the houses of Sandbourne , and night was shut close over all . Christopher , about eight o'clock , was standing at the end of the pier with his back towards the open sea , whence the waves were pushing to the shore in frills and coils that were just rendered visible in all their bleak instability by the row of lights along the sides of the jetty , the rapid motion landward of the wavetips producing upon his eye an apparent progress of the pier out to sea . This pier-head was a spot which Christopher enjoyed visiting on such moaning and sighing nights as the present , when the sportive and variegated throng that haunted the pier on autumn days was no longer there , and he seemed alone with weather and the invincible sea . Somebody came towards him along the deserted footway , and rays from the nearest lamp streaked the face of his sister Faith . ' O Christopher , I knew you were here , ' she said eagerly . 'You are wanted ; there 's a servant come from Wyndway House for you . He is sent to ask if you can come immediately to play at a little dance they have resolved upon this evening -- quite suddenly it seems . If you can come , you must bring with you any assistant you can lay your hands upon at a moment 's notice , he says . ' 'Wyndway House ; why should the people send for me above all other musicians in the town ? ' Faith did not know . 'If you really decide to go , ' she said , as they walked homeward , 'you might take me as your assistant . I should answer the purpose , should I not , Kit ? since it is only a dance or two they seem to want . ' 'And your harp I suppose you mean . Yes ; you might be competent to take a part . It can not be a regular ball ; they would have had the quadrille band for anything of that sort . Faith -- we 'll go . However , let us see the man first , and inquire particulars . ' Reaching home , Christopher found at his door a horse and wagonette in charge of a man-servant in livery , who repeated what Faith had told her brother . Wyndway House was a well-known country-seat three or four miles out of the town , and the coachman mentioned that if they were going it would be well that they should get ready to start as soon as they conveniently could , since he had been told to return by ten if possible . Christopher quickly prepared himself , and put a new string or two into Faith 's harp , by which time she also was dressed ; and , wrapping up herself and her instrument safe from the night air , away they drove at half-past nine . 'Is it a large party ? ' said Christopher , as they whizzed along . 'No , sir ; it is what we call a dance -- that is , 't is like a ball , you know , on a small scale -- a ball on a spurt , that you never thought of till you had it . In short , it grew out of a talk at dinner , I believe ; and some of the young people present wanted a jig , and did n't care to play themselves , you know , young ladies being an idle class of society at the best of times . We 've a house full of sleeping company , you understand -- been there a week some of 'em -- most of 'em being mistress's relations . ' 'They probably found it a little dull . ' 'Well , yes -- it is rather dull for 'em -- Christmas-time and all . As soon as it was proposed they were wild for sending post-haste for somebody or other to play to them . ' 'Did they name me particularly ? ' said Christopher . 'Yes ; `` Mr. Christopher Julian , '' she says . `` The gent who 's turned music- man ? '' I said . `` Yes , that 's him , '' says she . ' 'There were music-men living nearer to your end of the town than I . ' 'Yes , but I know it was you particular : though I do n't think mistress thought anything about you at first . Mr. Joyce -- that 's the butler -- said that your name was mentioned to our old party , when he was in the room , by a young lady staying with us , and mistress says then , `` The Julians have had a downfall , and the son has taken to music . '' Then when dancing was talked of , they said , `` O , let 's have him by all means . '' ' 'Was the young lady who first inquired for my family the same one who said , `` Let 's have him by all means ? '' ' ' O no ; but it was on account of her asking that the rest said they would like you to play -- at least that 's as I had it from Joyce . ' 'Do you know that lady 's name ? ' 'Mrs . Petherwin . ' 'Ah ! ' 'Cold , sir ? ' ' O no . ' Christopher did not like to question the man any further , though what he had heard added new life to his previous curiosity ; and they drove along the way in silence , Faith 's figure , wrapped up to the top of her head , cutting into the sky behind them like a sugar-loaf . Such gates as crossed the roads had been left open by the forethought of the coachman , and , passing the lodge , they proceeded about half-a-mile along a private drive , then ascended a rise , and came in view of the front of the mansion , punctured with windows that were now mostly lighted up . 'What is that ? ' said Faith , catching a glimpse of something that the carriage-lamp showed on the face of one wall as they passed , a marble bas- relief of some battle-piece , built into the stonework . 'That 's the scene of the death of one of the squire 's forefathers -- Colonel Sir Martin Jones , who was killed at the moment of victory in the battle of Salamanca -- but I have n't been here long enough to know the rights of it . When I am in one of my meditations , as I wait here with the carriage sometimes , I think how many more get killed at the moment of victory than at the moment of defeat . This is the entrance for you , sir . ' And he turned the corner and pulled up before a side door . They alighted and went in , Christopher shouldering Faith 's harp , and she marching modestly behind , with curly-eared music-books under her arm . They were shown into the house-steward 's room , and ushered thence along a badly-lit passage and past a door within which a hum and laughter were audible . The door next to this was then opened for them , and they entered . * * * * * Scarcely had Faith , or Christopher either , ever beheld a more shining scene than was presented by the saloon in which they now found themselves . Coming direct from the gloomy park , and led to the room by that back passage from the servants ' quarter , the light from the chandelier and branches against the walls , striking on gilding at all points , quite dazzled their sight for a minute or two ; it caused Faith to move forward with her eyes on the floor , and filled Christopher with an impulse to turn back again into some dusky corner where every thread of his not over-new dress suit -- rather moth-eaten through lack of feasts for airing it -- could be counted less easily . He was soon seated before a grand piano , and Faith sat down under the shadow of her harp , both being arranged on a dais within an alcove at one end of the room . A screen of ivy and holly had been constructed across the front of this recess for the games of the children on Christmas Eve , and it still remained there , a small creep-hole being left for entrance and exit . Then the merry guests tumbled through doors at the further end , and dancing began . The mingling of black-coated men and bright ladies gave a charming appearance to the groups as seen by Faith and her brother , the whole spectacle deriving an unexpected novelty from the accident of reaching their eyes through interstices in the tracery of green leaves , which added to the picture a softness that it would not otherwise have possessed . On the other hand , the musicians , having a much weaker light , could hardly be discerned by the performers in the dance . The music was now rattling on , and the ladies in their foam-like dresses were busily threading and spinning about the floor , when Faith , casually looking up into her brother 's face , was surprised to see that a change had come over it . At the end of the quadrille he leant across to her before she had time to speak , and said quietly , 'She 's here ! ' 'Who ? ' said Faith , for she had not heard the words of the coachman . 'Ethelberta . ' 'Which is she ? ' asked Faith , peeping through with the keenest interest . 'The one who has the skirts of her dress looped up with convolvulus flowers -- the one with her hair fastened in a sort of Venus knot behind ; she has just been dancing with that perfumed piece of a man they call Mr. Ladywell -- it is he with the high eyebrows arched like a girl 's . ' He added , with a wrinkled smile , ' I can not for my life see anybody answering to the character of husband to her , for every man takes notice of her . ' They were interrupted by another dance being called for , and then , his fingers tapping about upon the keys as mechanically as fowls pecking at barleycorns , Christopher gave himself up with a curious and far from unalloyed pleasure to the occupation of watching Ethelberta , now again crossing the field of his vision like a returned comet whose characteristics were becoming purely historical . She was a plump-armed creature , with a white round neck as firm as a fort -- altogether a vigorous shape , as refreshing to the eye as the green leaves through which he beheld her . She danced freely , and with a zest that was apparently irrespective of partners . He had been waiting long to hear her speak , and when at length her voice did reach his ears , it was the revelation of a strange matter to find how great a thing that small event had become to him . He knew the old utterance -- rapid but not frequent , an obstructive thought causing sometimes a sudden halt in the midst of a stream of words . But the features by which a cool observer would have singled her out from others in his memory when asking himself what she was like , was a peculiar gaze into imaginary far-away distance when making a quiet remark to a partner -- not with contracted eyes like a seafaring man , but with an open full look -- a remark in which little words in a low tone were made to express a great deal , as several single gentlemen afterwards found . The production of dance-music when the criticizing stage among the dancers has passed , and they have grown full of excitement and animal spirits , does not require much concentration of thought in the producers thereof ; and desultory conversation accordingly went on between Faith and her brother from time to time . 'Kit , ' she said on one occasion , 'are you looking at the way in which the flowers are fastened to the leaves ? -- taking a mean advantage of being at the back of the tapestry ? You can not think how you stare at them . ' ' I was looking through them -- certainly not at them . I have a feeling of being moved about like a puppet in the hands of a person who legally can be nothing to me . ' 'That charming woman with the shining bunch of hair and convolvuluses ? ' 'Yes : it is through her that we are brought here , and through her writing that poem , `` Cancelled Words , '' that the book was sent me , and through the accidental renewal of acquaintance between us on Anglebury Heath , that she wrote the poem . I was , however , at the moment you spoke , thinking more particularly of the little teacher whom Ethelberta must have commissioned to send the book to me ; and why that girl was chosen to do it . ' 'There may be a hundred reasons . Kit , I have never yet seen her look once this way . ' Christopher had certainly not yet received look or gesture from her ; but his time came . It was while he was for a moment outside the recess , and he caught her in the act . She became slightly confused , turned aside , and entered into conversation with a neighbour . It was only a look , and yet what a look it was ! One may say of a look that it is capable of division into as many species , genera , orders , and classes , as the animal world itself . Christopher saw Ethelberta Petherwin 's performance in this kind -- the well-known spark of light upon the well-known depths of mystery -- and felt something going out of him which had gone out of him once before . Thus continually beholding her and her companions in the giddy whirl , the night wore on with the musicians , last dances and more last dances being added , till the intentions of the old on the matter were thrice exceeded in the interests of the young . Watching the couples whirl and turn , advance and recede as gently as spirits , knot themselves like house-flies and part again , and lullabied by the faint regular beat of their footsteps to the tune , the players sank into the peculiar mesmeric quiet which comes over impressionable people who play for a great length of time in the midst of such scenes ; and at last the only noises that Christopher took cognizance of were those of the exceptional kind , breaking above the general sea of sound -- a casual smart rustle of silk , a laugh , a stumble , the monosyllabic talk of those who happened to linger for a moment close to the leafy screen -- all coming to his ears like voices from those old times when he had mingled in similar scenes , not as servant but as guest . 5 . AT THE WINDOW -- THE ROAD HOME The dancing was over at last , and the radiant company had left the room . A long and weary night it had been for the two players , though a stimulated interest had hindered physical exhaustion in one of them for a while . With tingling fingers and aching arms they came out of the alcove into the long and deserted apartment , now pervaded by a dry haze . The lights had burnt low , and Faith and her brother were waiting by request till the wagonette was ready to take them home , a breakfast being in course of preparation for them meanwhile . Christopher had crossed the room to relieve his cramped limbs , and now , peeping through a crevice in the window curtains , he said suddenly , 'Who 's for a transformation scene ? Faith , look here ! ' He touched the blind , up it flew , and a gorgeous scene presented itself to her eyes . A huge inflamed sun was breasting the horizon of a wide sheet of sea which , to her surprise and delight , the mansion overlooked . The brilliant disc fired all the waves that lay between it and the shore at the bottom of the grounds , where the water tossed the ruddy light from one undulation to another in glares as large and clear as mirrors , incessantly altering them , destroying them , and creating them again ; while further off they multiplied , thickened , and ran into one another like struggling armies , till they met the fiery source of them all . ' O , how wonderful it is ! ' said Faith , putting her hand on Christopher's arm . 'Who knew that whilst we were all shut in here with our puny illumination such an exhibition as this was going on outside ! How sorry and mean the grand and stately room looks now ! ' Christopher turned his back upon the window , and there were the hitherto beaming candle-flames shining no more radiantly than tarnished javelin- heads , while the snow-white lengths of wax showed themselves clammy and cadaverous as the fingers of a corpse . The leaves and flowers which had appeared so very green and blooming by the artificial light were now seen to be faded and dusty . Only the gilding of the room in some degree brought itself into keeping with the splendours outside , stray darts of light seizing upon it and lengthening themselves out along fillet , quirk , arris , and moulding , till wasted away . 'It seems , ' said Faith , 'as if all the people who were lately so merry here had died : we ourselves look no more than ghosts . ' She turned up her weary face to her brother 's , which the incoming rays smote aslant , making little furrows of every wrinkle thereon , and shady ravines of every little furrow . 'You are very tired , Faith , ' he said . 'Such a heavy night 's work has been almost too much for you . ' ' O , I do n't mind that , ' said Faith . 'But I could not have played so long by myself . ' 'We filled up one another 's gaps ; and there were plenty of them towards the morning ; but , luckily , people do n't notice those things when the small hours draw on . ' 'What troubles me most , ' said Faith , 'is not that I have worked , but that you should be so situated as to need such miserable assistance as mine . We are poor , are we not , Kit ? ' 'Yes , we know a little about poverty , ' he replied . While thus lingering 'In shadowy thoroughfares of thought , ' Faith interrupted with , ' I believe there is one of the dancers now ! -- why , I should have thought they had all gone to bed , and would n't get up again for days . ' She indicated to him a figure on the lawn towards the left , looking upon the same flashing scene as that they themselves beheld . 'It is your own particular one , ' continued Faith . 'Yes , I see the blue flowers under the edge of her cloak . ' 'And I see her squirrel-coloured hair , ' said Christopher . Both stood looking at this apparition , who once , and only once , thought fit to turn her head towards the front of the house they were gazing from . Faith was one in whom the meditative somewhat overpowered the active faculties ; she went on , with no abundance of love , to theorize upon this gratuitously charming woman , who , striking freakishly into her brother 's path , seemed likely to do him no good in her sisterly estimation . Ethelberta 's bright and shapely form stood before her critic now , smartened by the motes of sunlight from head to heel : what Faith would have given to see her so clearly within ! 'Without doubt she is already a lady of many romantic experiences , ' she said dubiously . 'And on the way to many more , ' said Christopher . The tone was just of the kind which may be imagined of a sombre man who had been up all night piping that others might dance . Faith parted her lips as if in consternation at possibilities . Ethelberta , having already become an influence in Christopher 's system , might soon become more -- an indestructible fascination -- to drag him about , turn his soul inside out , harrow him , twist him , and otherwise torment him , according to the stereotyped form of such processes . They were interrupted by the opening of a door . A servant entered and came up to them . 'This is for you , I believe , sir , ' he said . 'Two guineas ; ' and he placed the money in Christopher 's hand . 'Some breakfast will be ready for you in a moment if you like to have it . Would you wish it brought in here ; or will you come to the steward 's room ? ' 'Yes , we will come . ' And the man then began to extinguish the lights one by one . Christopher dropped the two pounds and two shillings singly into his pocket , and looking listlessly at the footman said , 'Can you tell me the address of that lady on the lawn ? Ah , she has disappeared ! ' 'She wore a dress with blue flowers , ' said Faith . 'And remarkable bright in her manner ? O , that 's the young widow , Mrs -- what 's that name -- I forget for the moment . ' 'Widow ? ' said Christopher , the eyes of his understanding getting wonderfully clear , and Faith uttering a private ejaculation of thanks that after all no commandments were likely to be broken in this matter . 'The lady I mean is quite a girlish sort of woman . ' 'Yes , yes , so she is -- that 's the one . Coachman says she must have been born a widow , for there is not time for her ever to have been made one . However , she 's not quite such a chicken as all that . Mrs. Petherwin , that 's the party 's name . ' 'Does she live here ? ' 'No , she is staying in the house visiting for a few days with her mother- in-law . They are a London family , I do n't know her address . ' 'Is she a poetess ? ' 'That I can not say . She is very clever at verses ; but she do n't lean over gates to see the sun , and goes to church as regular as you or I , so I should hardly be inclined to say that she 's the complete thing . When she 's up in one of her vagaries she 'll sit with the ladies and make up pretty things out of her head as fast as sticks a-breaking . They will run off her tongue like cotton from a reel , and if she can ever be got in the mind of telling a story she will bring it out that serious and awful that it makes your flesh creep upon your bones ; if she 's only got to say that she walked out of one door into another , she 'll tell it so that there seems something wonderful in it . 'T is a bother to start her , so our people say behind her back , but , once set going , the house is all alive with her . However , it will soon be dull enough ; she and Lady Petherwin are off to-morrow for Rookington , where I believe they are going to stay over New Year 's Day . ' 'Where do you say they are going ? ' inquired Christopher , as they followed the footman . 'Rookington Park -- about three miles out of Sandbourne , in the opposite direction to this . ' ' A widow , ' Christopher murmured . Faith overheard him . 'That makes no difference to us , does it ? ' she said wistfully . Forty minutes later they were driving along an open road over a ridge which commanded a view of a small inlet below them , the sands of this nook being sheltered by crumbling cliffs . Here at once they saw , in the full light of the sun , two women standing side by side , their faces directed over the sea . 'There she is again ! ' said Faith . 'She has walked along the shore from the lawn where we saw her before . ' 'Yes , ' said the coachman , 'she 's a curious woman seemingly . She 'll talk to any poor body she meets . You see she had been out for a morning walk instead of going to bed , and that is some queer mortal or other she has picked up with on her way . ' ' I wonder she does not prefer some rest , ' Faith observed . The road then dropped into a hollow , and the women by the sea were no longer within view from the carriage , which rapidly neared Sandbourne with the two musicians . 6 . THE SHORE BY WYNDWAY The east gleamed upon Ethelberta 's squirrel-coloured hair as she said to her companion , ' I have come , Picotee ; but not , as you imagine , from a night 's sleep . We have actually been dancing till daylight at Wyndway . ' 'Then you should not have troubled to come ! I could have borne the disappointment under such circumstances , ' said the pupil-teacher , who , wearing a dress not so familiar to Christopher 's eyes as had been the little white jacket , had not been recognized by him from the hill . 'You look so tired , Berta . I could not stay up all night for the world ! ' 'One gets used to these things , ' said Ethelberta quietly . ' I should have been in bed certainly , had I not particularly wished to use this opportunity of meeting you before you go home to-morrow . I could not have come to Sandbourne to-day , because we are leaving to return again to Rookington . This is all that I wish you to take to mother -- only a few little things which may be useful to her ; but you will see what it contains when you open it . ' She handed to Picotee a small parcel . 'This is for yourself , ' she went on , giving a small packet besides . 'It will pay your fare home and back , and leave you something to spare . ' 'Thank you , ' said Picotee docilely . 'Now , Picotee , ' continued the elder , 'let us talk for a few minutes before I go back : we may not meet again for some time . ' She put her arm round the waist of Picotee , who did the same by Ethelberta ; and thus interlaced they walked backwards and forwards upon the firm flat sand with the motion of one body animated by one will . 'Well , what did you think of my poems ? ' ' I liked them ; but naturally , I did not understand all the experience you describe . It is so different from mine . Yet that made them more interesting to me . I thought I should so much like to mix in the same scenes ; but that of course is impossible . ' ' I am afraid it is . And you posted the book as I said ? ' 'Yes . ' She added hurriedly , as if to change the subject , ' I have told nobody that we are sisters , or that you are known in any way to me or to mother or to any of us . I thought that would be best , from what you said . ' 'Yes , perhaps it is best for the present . ' 'The box of clothes came safely , and I find very little alteration will be necessary to make the dress do beautifully for me on Sundays . It is quite new-fashioned to me , though I suppose it was old-fashioned to you . O , and Berta , will the title of Lady Petherwin descend to you when your mother-in-law dies ? ' 'No , of course not . She is only a knight 's widow , and that 's nothing . ' 'The lady of a knight looks as good on paper as the lady of a lord . ' 'Yes . And in other places too sometimes . However , about your journey home . Be very careful ; and do n't make any inquiries at the stations of anybody but officials . If any man wants to be friendly with you , try to find out if it is from a genuine wish to assist you , or from admiration of your fresh face . ' 'How shall I know which ? ' said Picotee . Ethelberta laughed . 'If Heaven does not tell you at the moment I can not , ' she said . 'But humanity looks with a different eye from love , and upon the whole it is most to be prized by all of us . I believe it ends oftener in marriage than do a lover 's flying smiles . So that for this and other reasons love from a stranger is mostly worthless as a speculation ; and it is certainly dangerous as a game . Well , Picotee , has any one paid you real attentions yet ? ' 'No -- that is -- ' 'There is something going on . ' 'Only a wee bit . ' ' I thought so . There was a dishonesty about your dear eyes which has never been there before , and love-making and dishonesty are inseparable as coupled hounds . Up comes man , and away goes innocence . Are you going to tell me anything about him ? ' ' I would rather not , Ethelberta ; because it is hardly anything . ' 'Well , be careful . And mind this , never tell him what you feel . ' 'But then he will never know it . ' 'Nor must he . He must think it only . The difference between his thinking and knowing is often the difference between your winning and losing . But general advice is not of much use , and I can not give more unless you tell more . What is his name ? ' Picotee did not reply . 'Never mind : keep your secret . However , listen to this : not a kiss -- not so much as the shadow , hint , or merest seedling of a kiss ! ' 'There is no fear of it , ' murmured Picotee ; 'though not because of me ! ' 'You see , my dear Picotee , a lover is not a relative ; and he is n't quite a stranger ; but he may end in being either , and the way to reduce him to whichever of the two you wish him to be is to treat him like the other . Men who come courting are just like bad cooks : if you are kind to them , instead of ascribing it to an exceptional courtesy on your part , they instantly set it down to their own marvellous worth . ' 'But I ought to favour him just a little , poor thing ? Just the smallest glimmer of a gleam ! ' 'Only a very little indeed -- so that it comes as a relief to his misery , not as adding to his happiness . ' 'It is being too clever , all this ; and we ought to be harmless as doves . ' 'Ah , Picotee ! to continue harmless as a dove you must be wise as a serpent , you 'll find -- ay , ten serpents , for that matter . ' 'But if I can not get at him , how can I manage him in these ways you speak of ? ' 'Get at him ? I suppose he gets at you in some way , does he not ? -- tries to see you , or to be near you ? ' 'No -- that 's just the point -- he does n't do any such thing , and there 's the worry of it ! ' 'Well , what a silly girl ! Then he is not your lover at all ? ' 'Perhaps he 's not . But I am his , at any rate -- twice over . ' 'That 's no use . Supply the love for both sides ? Why , it 's worse than furnishing money for both . You do n't suppose a man will give his heart in exchange for a woman 's when he has already got hers for nothing ? That 's not the way old Adam does business at all . ' Picotee sighed . 'Have you got a young man , too , Berta ? ' ' A young man ? ' ' A lover I mean -- that 's what we call 'em down here . ' 'It is difficult to explain , ' said Ethelberta evasively . ' I knew one many years ago , and I have seen him again , and -- that is all . ' 'According to my idea you have one , but according to your own you have not ; he does not love you , but you love him -- is that how it is ? ' ' I have not quite considered how it is . ' 'Do you love him ? ' ' I have never seen a man I hate less . ' ' A great deal lies covered up there , I expect ! ' 'He was in that carriage which drove over the hill at the moment we met here . ' 'Ah-ah -- some great lord or another who has his day by candlelight , and so on . I guess the style . Somebody who no more knows how much bread is a loaf than I do the price of diamonds and pearls . ' ' I am afraid he 's only a commoner as yet , and not a very great one either . But surely you guess , Picotee ? But I 'll set you an example of frankness by telling his name . My friend , Mr. Julian , to whom you posted the book . Such changes as he has seen ! -- from affluence to poverty . He and his sister have been playing dances all night at Wyndway -- What is the matter ? ' 'Only a pain ! ' 'My dear Picotee -- ' ' I think I 'll sit down for a moment , Berta . ' 'What -- have you over-walked yourself , dear ? ' 'Yes -- and I got up very early , you see . ' ' I hope you are not going to be ill , child . You look as if you ought not to be here . ' ' O , it is quite trifling . Does not getting up in a hurry cause a sense of faintness sometimes ? ' 'Yes , in people who are not strong . ' 'If we do n't talk about being faint it will go off . Faintness is such a queer thing that to think of it is to have it . Let us talk as we were talking before -- about your young man and other indifferent matters , so as to divert my thoughts from fainting , dear Berta . I have always thought the book was to be forwarded to that gentleman because he was a connection of yours by marriage , and he had asked for it . And so you have met this -- this Mr. Julian , and gone for walks with him in evenings , I suppose , just as young men and women do who are courting ? ' 'No , indeed -- what an absurd child you are ! ' said Ethelberta . ' I knew him once , and he is interesting ; a few little things like that make it all up . ' 'The love is all on one side , as with me . ' ' O no , no : there is nothing like that . I am not attached to any one , strictly speaking -- though , more strictly speaking , I am not unattached . ' ''Tis a delightful middle mind to be in . I know it , for I was like it once ; but I had scarcely been so long enough to know where I was before I was gone past . ' 'You should have commanded yourself , or drawn back entirely ; for let me tell you that at the beginning of caring for a man -- just when you are suspended between thinking and feeling -- there is a hair's-breadth of time at which the question of getting into love or not getting in is a matter of will -- quite a thing of choice . At the same time , drawing back is a tame dance , and the best of all is to stay balanced awhile . ' 'You do that well , I 'll warrant . ' 'Well , no ; for what between continually wanting to love , to escape the blank lives of those who do not , and wanting not to love , to keep out of the miseries of those who do , I get foolishly warm and foolishly cold by turns . ' 'Yes -- and I am like you as far as the `` foolishly '' goes . I wish we poor girls could contrive to bring a little wisdom into our love by way of a change ! ' 'That 's the very thing that leading minds in town have begun to do , but there are difficulties . It is easy to love wisely , but the rich man may not marry you ; and it is not very hard to reject wisely , but the poor man does n't care . Altogether it is a precious problem . But shall we clamber out upon those shining blocks of rock , and find some of the little yellow shells that are in the crevices ? I have ten minutes longer , and then I must go . ' 7 . THE DINING-ROOM OF A TOWN HOUSE -- THE BUTLER 'S PANTRY A few weeks later there was a friendly dinner-party at the house of a gentleman called Doncastle , who lived in a moderately fashionable square of west London . All the friends and relatives present were nice people , who exhibited becoming signs of pleasure and gaiety at being there ; but as regards the vigour with which these emotions were expressed , it may be stated that a slight laugh from far down the throat and a slight narrowing of the eye were equivalent as indices of the degree of mirth felt to a Ha-ha-ha ! and a shaking of the shoulders among the minor traders of the kingdom ; and to a Ho-ho-ho ! contorted features , purple face , and stamping foot among the gentlemen in corduroy and fustian who adorn the remoter provinces . The conversation was chiefly about a volume of musical , tender , and humorous rhapsodies lately issued to the world in the guise of verse , which had been reviewed and talked about everywhere . This topic , beginning as a private dialogue between a young painter named Ladywell and the lady on his right hand , had enlarged its ground by degrees , as a subject will extend on those rare occasions when it happens to be one about which each person has thought something beforehand , instead of , as in the natural order of things , one to which the oblivious listener replies mechanically , with earnest features , but with thoughts far away . And so the whole table made the matter a thing to inquire or reply upon at once , and isolated rills of other chat died out like a river in the sands . 'Witty things , and occasionally Anacreontic : and they have the originality which such a style must naturally possess when carried out by a feminine hand , ' said Ladywell . 'If it is a feminine hand , ' said a man near . Ladywell looked as if he sometimes knew secrets , though he did not wish to boast . 'Written , I presume you mean , in the Anacreontic measure of three feet and a half -- spondees and iambics ? ' said a gentleman in spectacles , glancing round , and giving emphasis to his inquiry by causing bland glares of a circular shape to proceed from his glasses towards the person interrogated . The company appeared willing to give consideration to the words of a man who knew such things as that , and hung forward to listen . But Ladywell stopped the whole current of affairs in that direction by saying -- ' O no ; I was speaking rather of the matter and tone . In fact , the Seven Days ' Review said they were Anacreontic , you know ; and so they are -- any one may feel they are . ' The general look then implied a false encouragement , and the man in spectacles looked down again , being a nervous person , who never had time to show his merits because he was so much occupied in hiding his faults . 'Do you know the authoress , Mr . Neigh ? ' continued Ladywell . 'Ca n't say that I do , ' he replied . Neigh was a man who never disturbed the flesh upon his face except when he was obliged to do so , and paused ten seconds where other people only paused one ; as he moved his chin in speaking , motes of light from under the candle-shade caught , lost , and caught again the outlying threads of his burnished beard . 'She will be famous some day ; and you ought at any rate to read her book . ' 'Yes , I ought , I know . In fact , some years ago I should have done it immediately , because I had a reason for pushing on that way just then . ' 'Ah , what was that ? ' 'Well , I thought of going in for Westminster Abbey myself at that time ; but a fellow has so much to do , and -- ' 'What a pity that you did n't follow it up . A man of your powers , Mr. Neigh -- ' 'Afterwards I found I was too steady for it , and had too much of the respectable householder in me . Besides , so many other men are on the same tack ; and then I did n't care about it , somehow . ' ' I do n't understand high art , and am utterly in the dark on what are the true laws of criticism , ' a plain married lady , who wore archaeological jewellery , was saying at this time . 'But I know that I have derived an unusual amount of amusement from those verses , and I am heartily thankful to `` E. '' for them . ' ' I am afraid , ' said a gentleman who was suffering from a bad shirt-front , 'that an estimate which depends upon feeling in that way is not to be trusted as permanent opinion . ' The subject now flitted to the other end . 'Somebody has it that when the heart flies out before the understanding , it saves the judgment a world of pains , ' came from a voice in that quarter . ' I , for my part , like something merry , ' said an elderly woman , whose face was bisected by the edge of a shadow , which toned her forehead and eyelids to a livid neutral tint , and left her cheeks and mouth like metal at a white heat in the uninterrupted light . ' I think the liveliness of those ballads as great a recommendation as any . After all , enough misery is known to us by our experiences and those of our friends , and what we see in the newspapers , for all purposes of chastening , without having gratuitous grief inflicted upon us . ' 'But you would not have wished that `` Romeo and Juliet '' should have ended happily , or that Othello should have discovered the perfidy of his Ancient in time to prevent all fatal consequences ? ' ' I am not afraid to go so far as that , ' said the old lady . 'Shakespeare is not everybody , and I am sure that thousands of people who have seen those plays would have driven home more cheerfully afterwards if by some contrivance the characters could all have been joined together respectively . I uphold our anonymous author on the general ground of her levity . ' 'Well , it is an old and worn argument -- that about the inexpedience of tragedy -- and much may be said on both sides . It is not to be denied that the anonymous Sappho 's verses -- for it seems that she is really a woman -- are clever . ' 'Clever ! ' said Ladywell -- the young man who had been one of the shooting- party at Sandbourne -- 'they are marvellously brilliant . ' 'She is rather warm in her assumed character . ' 'That 's a sign of her actual coldness ; she lets off her feeling in theoretic grooves , and there is sure to be none left for practical ones . Whatever seems to be the most prominent vice , or the most prominent virtue in anybody 's writing is the one thing you are safest from in personal dealings with the writer . ' ' O , I do n't mean to call her warmth of feeling a vice or virtue exactly -- ' ' I agree with you , ' said Neigh to the last speaker but one , in tones as emphatic as they possibly could be without losing their proper character of indifference to the whole matter . 'Warm sentiment of any sort , whenever we have it , disturbs us too much to leave us repose enough for writing it down . ' ' I am sure , when I was at the ardent age , ' said the mistress of the house , in a tone of pleasantly agreeing with every one , particularly those who were diametrically opposed to each other , ' I could no more have printed such emotions and made them public than I -- could have helped privately feeling them . ' ' I wonder if she has gone through half she says ? If so , what an experience ! ' ' O no -- not at all likely , ' said Mr. Neigh . 'It is as risky to calculate people 's ways of living from their writings as their incomes from their way of living . ' 'She is as true to nature as fashion is false , ' said the painter , in his warmth becoming scarcely complimentary , as sometimes happens with young persons . ' I do n't think that she has written a word more than what every woman would deny feeling in a society where no woman says what she means or does what she says . And can any praise be greater than that ? ' 'Ha-ha ! Capital ! ' 'All her verses seem to me , ' said a rather stupid person , 'to be simply -- `` Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-la ' , Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-lu ' , Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-lalla ' , Tral'-la-la-lu ' . '' When you take away the music there is nothing left . Yet she is plainly a woman of great culture . ' 'Have you seen what the London Light says about them -- one of the finest things I have ever read in the way of admiration ? ' continued Ladywell , paying no attention to the previous speaker . He lingered for a reply , and then impulsively quoted several lines from the periodical he had named , without aid or hesitation . 'Good , is it not ? ' added Ladywell . They assented , but in such an unqualified manner that half as much readiness would have meant more . But Ladywell , though not experienced enough to be quite free from enthusiasm , was too experienced to mind indifference for more than a minute or two . When the ladies had withdrawn , the young man went on -- 'Colonel Staff said a funny thing to me yesterday about these very poems . He asked me if I knew her , and -- ' 'Her ? Why , he knows that it is a lady all the time , and we were only just now doubting whether the sex of the writer could be really what it seems . Shame , Ladywell ! ' said his friend Neigh . 'Ah , Mr. Ladywell , ' said another , 'now we have found you out . You know her ! ' 'Now -- I say -- ha-ha ! ' continued the painter , with a face expressing that he had not at all tried to be found out as the man possessing incomparably superior knowledge of the poetess . ' I beg pardon really , but do n't press me on the matter . Upon my word the secret is not my own . As I was saying , the Colonel said , `` Do you know her ? '' -- but you do n't care to hear ? ' 'We shall be delighted ! ' 'So the Colonel said , `` Do you know her ? '' adding , in a most comic way , '' Between U. and E. , Ladywell , I believe there is a close affinity '' -- meaning me , you know , by U . Just like the Colonel -- ha-ha-ha ! ' The older men did not oblige Ladywell a second time with any attempt at appreciation ; but a weird silence ensued , during which the smile upon Ladywell 's face became frozen to painful permanence . 'Meaning by E. , you know , the `` E '' of the poems -- heh-heh ! ' he added . 'It was a very humorous incident certainly , ' said his friend Neigh , at which there was a laugh -- not from anything connected with what he said , but simply because it was the right thing to laugh when Neigh meant you to do so . 'Now do n't , Neigh -- you are too hard upon me . But , seriously , two or three fellows were there when I said it , and they all began laughing -- but , then , the Colonel said it in such a queer way , you know . But you were asking me about her ? Well , the fact is , between ourselves , I do know that she is a lady ; and I do n't mind telling a word -- ' 'But we would not for the world be the means of making you betray her confidence -- would we , Jones ? ' 'No , indeed ; we would not . ' 'No , no ; it is not that at all -- this is really too bad ! -- you must listen just for a moment -- ' 'Ladywell , do n't betray anybody on our account . ' 'Whoever the illustrious young lady may be she has seen a great deal of the world , ' said Mr. Doncastle blandly , 'and puts her experience of the comedy of its emotions , and of its method of showing them , in a very vivid light . ' ' I heard a man say that the novelty with which the ideas are presented is more noticeable than the originality of the ideas themselves , ' observed Neigh . 'The woman has made a great talk about herself ; and I am quite weary of people asking of her condition , place of abode , has she a father , has she a mother , or dearer one yet than all other . ' ' I would have burlesque quotation put down by Act of Parliament , and all who dabble in it placed with him who can cite Scripture for his purposes , ' said Ladywell , in retaliation . After a pause Neigh remarked half-privately to their host , who was his uncle : 'Your butler Chickerel is a very intelligent man , as I have heard . ' 'Yes , he does very well , ' said Mr. Doncastle . 'But is he not a -- very extraordinary man ? ' 'Not to my knowledge , ' said Doncastle , looking up surprised . 'Why do you think that , Alfred ? ' 'Well , perhaps it was not a matter to mention . He reads a great deal , I dare say ? ' ' I do n't think so . ' ' I noticed how wonderfully his face kindled when we began talking about the poems during dinner . Perhaps he is a poet himself in disguise . Did you observe it ? ' 'No . To the best of my belief he is a very trustworthy and honourable man . He has been with us -- let me see , how long ? -- five months , I think , and he was fifteen years in his last place . It certainly is a new side to his character if he publicly showed any interest in the conversation , whatever he might have felt . ' 'Since the matter has been mentioned , ' said Mr. Jones , ' I may say that I too noticed the singularity of it . ' 'If you had not said otherwise , ' replied Doncastle somewhat warmly , ' I should have asserted him to be the last man-servant in London to infringe such an elementary rule . If he did so this evening , it is certainly for the first time , and I sincerely hope that no annoyance was caused -- ' ' O no , no -- not at all -- it might have been a mistake of mine , ' said Jones . ' I should quite have forgotten the circumstance if Mr. Neigh 's words had not brought it to my mind . It was really nothing to notice , and I beg that you will not say a word to him about it on my account . ' 'He has a taste that way , my dear uncle , nothing more , depend upon it , ' said Neigh . 'If I had such a man belonging to me I should only be too proud . Certainly do not mention it . ' 'Of course Chickerel is Chickerel , ' Mr. Doncastle rejoined . 'We all know what that means . And really , on reflecting , I do remember that he is of a literary turn of mind -- not further by an inch than is commendable , you know . I am quite aware as I glance down the papers and prints any morning that Chickerel 's eyes have been over the ground before mine , and that he generally forestalls the rest of us by a chapter or so in the last new book sent home ; but in these vicious days that particular weakness is really virtue , just because it is not quite a vice . ' 'Yes , ' said Mr. Jones , the reflective man in spectacles , 'positive virtues are getting moved off the stage : negative ones are moved on to the place of positives ; we thank bare justice as we used only to thank generosity ; call a man honest who steals only by law , and consider him a benefactor if he does not steal at all . ' 'Hear , hear ! ' said Neigh . 'We will decide that Chickerel is even a better trained fellow than if he had shown no interest at all in his face . ' 'The action being like those trifling irregularities in art at its vigorous periods , which seemed designed to hide the unpleasant monotony of absolute symmetry , ' said Ladywell . 'On the other hand , an affected want of training of that sort would be even a better disguise for an artful man than a perfectly impassible demeanour . He is two removes from discovery in a hidden scheme , whilst a neutral face is only one . ' 'You quite alarm me by these subtle theories , ' said Mr. Doncastle , laughing ; and the subject then became compounded with other matters , till the speakers rose to rejoin the charming flock upstairs . * * * * * In the basement story at this hour Mr. Chickerel the butler , who had formed the subject of discussion on the floor above , was busily engaged in looking after his two subordinates as they bustled about in the operations of clearing away . He was a man of whom , if the shape of certain bones and muscles of the face is ever to be taken as a guide to the character , one might safely have predicated conscientiousness in the performance of duties , a thorough knowledge of all that appertained to them , a general desire to live on without troubling his mind about anything which did not concern him . Any person interested in the matter would have assumed without hesitation that the estimate his employer had given of Chickerel was a true one -- more , that not only would the butler under all ordinary circumstances resolutely prevent his face from showing curiosity in an unbecoming way , but that , with the soul of a true gentleman , he would , if necessary , equivocate as readily as the noblest of his betters to remove any stain upon his honour in such trifles . Hence it is apparent that if Chickerel 's countenance really appeared , as Neigh had asserted , full of curiosity with regard to the gossip that was going on , the feelings which led to the exhibition must have been of a very unusual and irrepressible kind . His hair was of that peculiar bluish-white which is to be observed when the oncoming years , instead of singling out special locks of a man 's head for operating against , advance uniformly over the whole field , and enfeeble the colour at all points before absolutely extinguishing it anywhere ; his nose was of the knotty shape in the gristle and earthward tendency in the flesh which is commonly said to carry sound judgment above it , his eyes were thoughtful , and his face was thin -- a contour which , if it at once abstracted from his features that cheerful assurance of single-minded honesty which adorns the exteriors of so many of his brethren , might have raised a presumption in the minds of some beholders that perhaps in this case the quality might not be altogether wanting within . The coffee having been served to the people upstairs , one of the footmen rushed into his bedroom on the lower floor , and in a few minutes emerged again in the dress of a respectable clerk who had been born for better things , with the trifling exceptions that he wore a low-crowned hat , and instead of knocking his heels on the pavement walked with a gait as delicate as a lady 's . Going out of the area-door with a cigar in his mouth , he mounted the steps hastily to keep an appointment round the corner -- the keeping of which as a private gentleman necessitated the change of the greater part of his clothes twice within a quarter of an hour -- the limit of his time of absence . The other footman was upstairs , and the butler , finding that he had a few minutes to himself , sat down at the table and wrote : -- 'MY DEAR ETHELBERTA , -- I did not intend to write to you for some few days to come , but the way in which you have been talked about here this evening makes me anxious to send a line or two at once , though I have very little time to spare , as usual . We have just had a dinner- party -- indeed the carriages have not yet been brought round -- and the talk at dinner was about your verses , of course . The thing was brought up by a young fellow named Ladywell -- do you know him ? He is a painter by profession , but he has a pretty good private income beyond what he gets by practising his line of business among the nobility , and that I expect is not little , for he is well known , and encouraged because he is young , and good-looking , and so forth . His family own a good bit of land somewhere out Aldbrickham way . However , I am before my story . From what they all said it is pretty clear that you are thought a great deal of in fashionable society as a poetess -- but perhaps you know this as well as I -- moving in it as you do yourself , my dear . 'The ladies afterwards got very curious about your age , so curious , in fact , and so full of certainty that you were thirty-five and a blighted existence , if an hour , that I felt inclined to rap out there and then , and hang what came of it : `` My daughter , ladies , was to my own and her mother 's certain knowledge only twenty-one last birthday , and has as bright a heart as anybody in London . '' One of them actually said that you must be fifty to have got such an experience . Her guess was a very shrewd one in the bottom of it , however , for it was grounded upon the way you use those strange experiences of mine in the society that I tell you of , and dress them up as if they were yours ; and , as you see , she hit off my own age to a year . I thought it was very sharp of her to be so right , although so wrong . ' I do not want to influence your plans in any way about things which your school learning fits you to understand much better than I , who never had such opportunities , but I think that if I were in your place , Berta , I would not let my name be known just yet , for people always want what 's kept from them , and do n't value what 's given . I am not sure , but I think that after the women had gone upstairs the others turned their thoughts upon you again ; what they said about you I do n't know , for if there 's one thing I hate 't is hanging about the doors when the men begin to get moved by their wine , which they did to a large extent to-night , and spoke very loud . They always do here , for old Don is a hearty giver in his way . However , as you see these people from their own level now , it is not much that I can tell you in seeing them only from the under side , though I see strange things sometimes , and of course -- `` What great ones do the less will prattle of , '' as it says in that book of select pieces that you gave me . 'Well , my dear girl , I hope you will prosper . One thing above all others you 'll have to mind , and it is that folk must continually strain to advance in order to remain where they are : and you particularly . But as for trying too hard , I would n't do it . Much lies in minding this , that your best plan for lightness of heart is to raise yourself a little higher than your old mates , but not so high as to be quite out of their reach . All human beings enjoy themselves from the outside , and so getting on a little has this good in it , you still keep in your old class where your feelings are , and are thoughtfully treated by this class : while by getting on too much you are sneered at by your new acquaintance , who do n't know the skill of your rise , and you are parted from and forgot by the old ones who do . Whatever happens , do n't be too quick to feel . You will surely get some hard blows when you are found out , for if the great can find no excuse for hitting with a mind , they 'll do it and say 't was in fun . But you are young and healthy , and youth and health are power . I wish I could have a decent footman here with me , but I suppose it is no use trying . It is such men as these that provoke the contempt we get . Well , thank God a few years will see the end of me , for I am growing ashamed of my company -- so different as they are to the servants of old times. -- Your affectionate father , R. CHICKEREL . ' P.S. -- Do not press Lady Petherwin any further to remove the rules on which you live with her . She is quite right : she can not keep us , and to recognize us would do you no good , nor us either . We are content to see you secretly , since it is best for you . ' 8 . CHRISTOPHER 'S LODGINGS -- THE GROUNDS ABOUT ROOKINGTON Meanwhile , in the distant town of Sandbourne , Christopher Julian had recovered from the weariness produced by his labours at the Wyndway evening-party where Ethelberta had been a star . Instead of engaging his energies to clear encumbrances from the tangled way of his life , he now set about reading the popular 'Metres by E. ' with more interest and assiduity than ever ; for though Julian was a thinker by instinct , he was a worker by effort only ; and the higher of these kinds being dependent upon the lower for its exhibition , there was often a lamentable lack of evidence of his power in either . It is a provoking correlation , and has conduced to the obscurity of many a genius . 'Kit , ' said his sister , on reviving at the end of the bad headache which had followed the dance , 'those poems seem to have increased in value with you . The lady , lofty as she appears to be , would be flattered if she only could know how much you study them . Have you decided to thank her for them ? Now let us talk it over -- I like having a chat about such a pretty new subject . ' ' I would thank her in a moment if I were absolutely certain that she had anything to do with sending them , or even writing them . I am not quite sure of that yet . ' 'How strange that a woman could bring herself to write those verses ! ' 'Not at all strange -- they are natural outpourings . ' Faith looked critically at the remoter caverns of the fire . 'Why strange ? ' continued Christopher . 'There is no harm in them . ' ' O no -- no harm . But I can not explain to you -- unless you see it partly of your own accord -- that to write them she must be rather a fast lady -- not a bad fast lady ; a nice fast lady , I mean , of course . There , I have said it now , and I daresay you are vexed with me , for your interest in her has deepened to what it originally was , I think . I do n't mean any absolute harm by `` fast , '' Kit . ' 'Bold , forward , you mean , I suppose ? ' Faith tried to hit upon a better definition which should meet all views ; and , on failing to do so , looked concerned at her brother 's somewhat grieved appearance , and said , helplessly , 'Yes , I suppose I do . ' 'My idea of her is quite the reverse . A poetess must intrinsically be sensitive , or she could never feel : but then , frankness is a rhetorical necessity even with the most modest , if their inspirations are to do any good in the world . You will , for certain , not be interested in something I was going to tell you , which I thought would have pleased you immensely ; but it is not worth mentioning now . ' 'If you will not tell me , never mind . But do n't be crabbed , Kit ! You know how interested I am in all your affairs . ' 'It is only that I have composed an air to one of the prettiest of her songs , `` When tapers tall '' -- but I am not sure about the power of it . This is how it begins -- I threw it off in a few minutes , after you had gone to bed . ' He went to the piano and lightly touched over an air , the manuscript copy of which he placed in front of him , and listened to hear her opinion , having proved its value frequently ; for it was not that of a woman merely , but impersonally human . Though she was unknown to fame , this was a great gift in Faith , since to have an unsexed judgment is as precious as to be an unsexed being is deplorable . 'It is very fair indeed , ' said the sister , scarcely moving her lips in her great attention . 'Now again , and again , and again . How could you do it in the time ! ' Kit knew that she admired his performance : passive assent was her usual praise , and she seldom insisted vigorously upon any view of his compositions unless for purposes of emendation . ' I was thinking that , as I can not very well write to her , I may as well send her this , ' said Christopher , with lightened spirits , voice to correspond , and eyes likewise ; 'there can be no objection to it , for such things are done continually . Consider while I am gone , Faith . I shall be out this evening for an hour or two . ' When Christopher left the house shortly after , instead of going into the town on some errand , as was customary whenever he went from home after dark , he ascended a back street , passed over the hills behind , and walked at a brisk pace inland along the road to Rookington Park , where , as he had learnt , Ethelberta and Lady Petherwin were staying for a time , the day or two which they spent at Wyndway having formed a short break in the middle of this visit . The moon was shining to-night , and Christopher sped onwards over the pallid high-road as readily as he could have done at noonday . In three-quarters of an hour he reached the park gates ; and entering now upon a tract which he had never before explored , he went along more cautiously and with some uncertainty as to the precise direction that the road would take . A frosted expanse of even grass , on which the shadow of his head appeared with an opal halo round it , soon allowed the house to be discovered beyond , the other portions of the park abounding with timber older and finer than that of any other spot in the neighbourhood . Christopher withdrew into the shade , and wheeled round to the front of the building that contained his old love . Here he gazed and idled , as many a man has done before him -- wondering which room the fair poetess occupied , waiting till lights began to appear in the upper windows -- which they did as uncertainly as glow-worms blinking up at eventide -- and warming with currents of revived feeling in perhaps the sweetest of all conditions . New love is brightest , and long love is greatest ; but revived love is the tenderest thing known upon earth . Occupied thus , Christopher was greatly surprised to see , on casually glancing to one side , another man standing close to the shadowy trunk of another tree , in a similar attitude to his own , gazing , with arms folded , as blankly at the windows of the house as Christopher himself had been gazing . Not willing to be discovered , Christopher stuck closer to his tree . While he waited thus , the stranger began murmuring words , in a slow soft voice . Christopher listened till he heard the following : -- 'Pale was the day and rayless , love , That had an eve so dim . ' Two well-known lines from one of Ethelberta 's poems . Jealousy is a familiar kind of heat which disfigures , licks playfully , clouds , blackens , and boils a man as a fire does a pot ; and on recognizing these pilferings from what he had grown to regard as his own treasury , Christopher 's fingers began to nestle with great vigour in the palms of his hands . Three or four minutes passed , when the unknown rival gave a last glance at the windows , and walked away . Christopher did not like the look of that walk at all -- there was grace enough in it to suggest that his antagonist had no mean chance of finding favour in a woman 's eyes . A sigh , too , seemed to proceed from the stranger 's breast ; but as their distance apart was too great for any such sound to be heard by any possibility , Christopher set down that to imagination , or to the brushing of the wind over the trees . The lighted windows went out one by one , and all the house was in darkness . Julian then walked off himself , with a vigour that was spasmodic only , and with much less brightness of mind than he had experienced on his journey hither . The stranger had gone another way , and Christopher saw no more of him . When he reached Sandbourne , Faith was still sitting up . 'But I told you I was going to take a long walk , ' he said . 'No , Christopher : really you did not . How tired and sad you do look -- though I always know beforehand when you are in that state : one of your feet has a drag about it as you pass along the pavement outside the window . ' 'Yes , I forgot that I did not tell you . ' He could not begin to describe his pilgrimage : it was too silly a thing even for her to hear of . 'It does not matter at all about my staying up , ' said Faith assuringly ; 'that is , if exercise benefits you . Walking up and down the lane , I suppose ? ' 'No ; not walking up and down the lane . ' 'The turnpike-road to Rookington is pleasant . ' 'Faith , that is really where I have been . How came you to know ? ' ' I only guessed . Verses and an accidental meeting produce a special journey . ' 'Ethelberta is a fine woman , physically and mentally , both . I wonder people do not talk about her twice as much as they do . ' 'Then surely you are getting attached to her again . You think you discover in her more than anybody else does ; and love begins with a sense of superior discernment . ' 'No , no . That is only nonsense , ' he said hurriedly . 'However , love her or love her not , I can keep a corner of my heart for you , Faith . There is another brute after her too , it seems . ' 'Of course there is : I expect there are many . Her position in society is above ours , so that it is an unwise course to go troubling yourself more about her . ' 'No . If a needy man must be so foolish as to fall in love , it is best to do so where he can not double his foolishness by marrying the woman . ' ' I do n't like to hear you talk so slightingly of what poor father did . ' Christopher fixed his attention on the supper . That night , late as it was , when Faith was in bed and sleeping , he sat before a sheet of music- paper , neatly copying his composition upon it . The manuscript was intended as an offering to Ethelberta at the first convenient opportunity . * * * * * 'Well , after all my trouble to find out about Ethelberta , here comes the clue unasked for , ' said the musician to his sister a few days later . She turned and saw that he was reading the Wessex Reflector . 'What is it ? ' asked Faith . 'The secret of the true authorship of the book is out at last , and it is Ethelberta of course . I am so glad to have it proved hers . ' 'But can we believe -- ? ' ' O yes . Just hear what `` Our London Correspondent '' says . It is one of the nicest bits of gossip that he has furnished us with for a long time . ' 'Yes : now read it , do . ' ' '' The author of 'Metres by E. ' '' ' Christopher began , ' '' a book of which so much has been said and conjectured , and one , in fact , that has been the chief talk for several weeks past of the literary circles to which I belong , is a young lady who was a widow before she reached the age of eighteen , and is now not far beyond her fourth lustrum . I was additionally informed by a friend whom I met yesterday on his way to the House of Lords , that her name is Mrs. Petherwin -- Christian name Ethelberta ; and that she resides with her mother-in-law at their house in Exonbury Crescent . She is , moreover , the daughter of the late Bishop of Silchester ( if report may be believed ) , whose active benevolence , as your readers know , left his family in comparatively straitened circumstances at his death . The marriage was a secret one , and much against the wish of her husband 's friends , who are wealthy people on all sides . The death of the bridegroom two or three weeks after the wedding led to a reconciliation ; and the young poetess was taken to the home which she still occupies , devoted to the composition of such brilliant effusions as those the world has lately been favoured with from her pen . '' ' 'If you want to send her your music , you can do so now , ' said Faith . ' I might have sent it before , but I wanted to deliver it personally . However , it is all the same now , I suppose , whether I send it or not . I always knew that our destinies would lie apart , though she was once temporarily under a cloud . Her momentary inspiration to write that '' Cancelled Words '' was the worst possible omen for me . It showed that , thinking me no longer useful as a practical chance , she would make me ornamental as a poetical regret . But I 'll send the manuscript of the song . ' 'In the way of business , as a composer only ; and you must say to yourself , `` Ethelberta , as thou art but woman , I dare ; but as widow I fear thee . '' ' Notwithstanding Christopher 's affected carelessness , that evening saw a great deal of nicety bestowed upon the operation of wrapping up and sending off the song . He dropped it into the box and heard it fall , and with the curious power which he possessed of setting his wisdom to watch any particular folly in himself that it could not hinder , speculated as he walked on the result of this first tangible step of return to his old position as Ethelberta 's lover . 9 . A LADY 'S DRAWING-ROOMS -- ETHELBERTA 'S DRESSING-ROOM It was a house on the north side of Hyde Park , between ten and eleven in the evening , and several intelligent and courteous people had assembled there to enjoy themselves as far as it was possible to do so in a neutral way -- all carefully keeping every variety of feeling in a state of solution , in spite of any attempt such feelings made from time to time to crystallize on interesting subjects in hand . 'Neigh , who is that charming woman with her head built up in a novel way even for hair architecture -- the one with her back towards us ? ' said a man whose coat fitted doubtfully to a friend whose coat fitted well . 'Just going to ask for the same information , ' said Mr. Neigh , determining the very longest hair in his beard to an infinitesimal nicety by drawing its lower portion through his fingers . ' I have quite forgotten -- can not keep people 's names in my head at all ; nor could my father either -- nor any of my family -- a very odd thing . But my old friend Mrs. Napper knows for certain . ' And he turned to one of a small group of middle-aged persons near , who , instead of skimming the surface of things in general , like the rest of the company , were going into the very depths of them . ' O -- that is the celebrated Mrs. Petherwin , the woman who makes rhymes and prints 'em , ' said Mrs. Napper , in a detached sentence , and then continued talking again to those on the other side of her . The two loungers went on with their observations of Ethelberta's headdress , which , though not extraordinary or eccentric , did certainly convey an idea of indefinable novelty . Observers were sometimes half inclined to think that her cuts and modes were acquired by some secret communication with the mysterious clique which orders the livery of the fashionable world , for -- and it affords a parallel to cases in which clever thinkers in other spheres arrive independently at one and the same conclusion -- Ethelberta 's fashion often turned out to be the coming one . ' O , is that the woman at last ? ' said Neigh , diminishing his broad general gaze at the room to a close criticism of Ethelberta . ' '' The rhymes , '' as Mrs. Napper calls them , are not to be despised , ' said his companion . 'They are not quite virginibus puerisque , and the writer 's opinions of life and society differ very materially from mine , but I can not help admiring her in the more reflective pieces ; the songs I do n't care for . The method in which she handles curious subjects , and at the same time impresses us with a full conviction of her modesty , is very adroit , and somewhat blinds us to the fact that no such poems were demanded of her at all . ' ' I have not read them , ' said Neigh , secretly wrestling with his jaw , to prevent a yawn ; 'but I suppose I must . The truth is , that I never care much for reading what one ought to read ; I wish I did , but I can not help it . And , no doubt , you admire the lady immensely for writing them : I do n't . Everybody is so talented now-a-days that the only people I care to honour as deserving real distinction are those who remain in obscurity . I am myself hoping for a corner in some biographical dictionary when the time comes for those works only to contain lists of the exceptional individuals of whom nothing is known but that they lived and died . ' 'Ah -- listen . They are going to sing one of her songs , ' said his friend , looking towards a bustling movement in the neighbourhood of the piano . ' I believe that song , `` When tapers tall , '' has been set to music by three or four composers already . ' 'Men of any note ? ' said Neigh , at last beaten by his yawn , which courtesy nevertheless confined within his person to such an extent that only a few unimportant symptoms , such as reduced eyes and a certain rectangular manner of mouth in speaking , were visible . 'Scarcely , ' replied the other man . 'Established writers of music do not expend their energies upon new verse until they find that such verse is likely to endure ; for should the poet be soon forgotten , their labour is in some degree lost . ' 'Artful dogs -- who would have thought it ? ' said Neigh , just as an exercise in words ; and they drew nearer to the piano , less to become listeners to the singing than to be spectators of the scene in that quarter . But among some others the interest in the songs seemed to be very great ; and it was unanimously wished that the young lady who had practised the different pieces of music privately would sing some of them now in the order of their composers ' reputations . The musical persons in the room unconsciously resolved themselves into a committee of taste . One and another had been tried , when , at the end of the third , a lady spoke to Ethelberta . 'Now , Mrs. Petherwin , ' she said , gracefully throwing back her face , 'your opinion is by far the most valuable . In which of the cases do you consider the marriage of verse and tune to have been most successful ? ' Ethelberta , finding these and other unexpected calls made upon herself , came to the front without flinching . 'The sweetest and the best that I like by far , ' she said , 'is none of these . It is one which reached me by post only this morning from a place in Wessex , and is written by an unheard-of man who lives somewhere down there -- a man who will be , nevertheless , heard a great deal of some day , I hope -- think . I have only practised it this afternoon ; but , if one 's own judgment is worth anything , it is the best . ' 'Let us have your favourite , by all means , ' said another friend of Ethelberta 's who was present -- Mrs. Doncastle . ' I am so sorry that I can not oblige you , since you wish to hear it , ' replied the poetess regretfully ; 'but the music is at home . I had not received it when I lent the others to Miss Belmaine , and it is only in manuscript like the rest . ' 'Could it not be sent for ? ' suggested an enthusiast who knew that Ethelberta lived only in the next street , appealing by a look to her , and then to the mistress of the house . 'Certainly , let us send for it , ' said that lady . A footman was at once quietly despatched with precise directions as to where Christopher's sweet production might be found . 'What -- is there going to be something interesting ? ' asked a young married friend of Mrs. Napper , who had returned to her original spot . 'Yes -- the best song she has written is to be sung in the best manner to the best air that has been composed for it . I should not wonder if she were going to sing it herself . ' 'Did you know anything of Mrs. Petherwin until her name leaked out in connection with these ballads ? ' 'No ; but I think I recollect seeing her once before . She is one of those people who are known , as one may say , by subscription : everybody knows a little , till she is astonishingly well known altogether ; but nobody knows her entirely . She was the orphan child of some clergyman , I believe . Lady Petherwin , her mother-in-law , has been taking her about a great deal latterly . ' 'She has apparently a very good prospect . ' 'Yes ; and it is through her being of that curious undefined character which interprets itself to each admirer as whatever he would like to have it . Old men like her because she is so girlish ; youths because she is womanly ; wicked men because she is good in their eyes ; good men because she is wicked in theirs . ' 'She must be a very anomalous sort of woman , at that rate . ' 'Yes . Like the British Constitution , she owes her success in practice to her inconsistencies in principle . ' 'These poems must have set her up . She appears to be quite the correct spectacle . Happy Mrs . Petherwin ! ' The subject of their dialogue was engaged in a conversation with Mrs. Belmaine upon the management of households -- a theme provoked by a discussion that was in progress in the pages of some periodical of the time . Mrs. Belmaine was very full of the argument , and went on from point to point till she came to servants . The face of Ethelberta showed caution at once . ' I consider that Lady Plamby pets her servants by far too much , ' said Mrs. Belmaine . ' O , you do not know her ? Well , she is a woman with theories ; and she lends her maids and men books of the wrong kind for their station , and sends them to picture exhibitions which they do n't in the least understand -- all for the improvement of their taste , and morals , and nobody knows what besides . It only makes them dissatisfied . ' The face of Ethelberta showed venturesomeness . 'Yes , and dreadfully ambitious ! ' she said . 'Yes , indeed . What a turn the times have taken ! People of that sort push on , and get into business , and get great warehouses , until at last , without ancestors , or family , or name , or estate -- ' 'Or the merest scrap of heirloom or family jewel . ' 'Or heirlooms , or family jewels , they are thought as much of as if their forefathers had glided unobtrusively through the peerage -- ' 'Ever since the first edition . ' 'Yes . ' Mrs. Belmaine , who really sprang from a good old family , had been going to say , 'for the last seven hundred years , ' but fancying from Ethelberta 's addendum that she might not date back more than a trifling century or so , adopted the suggestion with her usual well-known courtesy , and blushed down to her locket at the thought of the mistake that she might have made . This sensitiveness was a trait in her character which gave great gratification to her husband , and , indeed , to all who knew her . 'And have you any theory on the vexed question of servant-government ? ' continued Mrs. Belmaine , smiling . 'But no -- the subject is of far too practical a nature for one of your bent , of course . ' ' O no -- it is not at all too practical . I have thought of the matter often , ' said Ethelberta . ' I think the best plan would be for somebody to write a pamphlet , `` The Shortest Way with the Servants , '' just as there was once written a terribly stinging one , `` The Shortest Way with the Dissenters , '' which had a great effect . ' ' I have always understood that that was written by a dissenter as a satire upon the Church ? ' 'Ah -- so it was : but the example will do to illustrate my meaning . ' 'Quite so -- I understand -- so it will , ' said Mrs. Belmaine , with clouded faculties . Meanwhile Christopher 's music had arrived . An accomplished gentleman who had every musical talent except that of creation , scanned the notes carefully from top to bottom , and sat down to accompany the singer . There was no lady present of sufficient confidence or skill to venture into a song she had never seen before , and the only one who had seen it was Ethelberta herself ; she did not deny having practised it the greater part of the afternoon , and was very willing to sing it now if anybody would derive pleasure from the performance . Then she began , and the sweetness of her singing was such that even the most unsympathetic honoured her by looking as if they would be willing to listen to every note the song contained if it were not quite so much trouble to do so . Some were so interested that , instead of continuing their conversation , they remained in silent consideration of how they would continue it when she had finished ; while the particularly civil people arranged their countenances into every attentive form that the mind could devise . One emotional gentleman looked at the corner of a chair as if , till that moment , such an object had never crossed his vision before ; the movement of his finger to the imagined tune was , for a deaf old clergyman , a perfect mine of interest ; whilst a young man from the country was powerless to put an end to an enchanted gaze at nothing at all in the exact middle of the room before him . Neigh , and the general phalanx of cool men and celebrated club yawners , were so much affected that they raised their chronic look of great objection to things , to an expression of scarcely any objection at all . 'What makes it so interesting , ' said Mrs. Doncastle to Ethelberta , when the song was over and she had retired from the focus of the company , 'is , that it is played from the composer 's own copy , which has never met the public eye , or any other than his own before to-day . And I see that he has actually sketched in the lines by hand , instead of having ruled paper -- just as the great old composers used to do . You must have been as pleased to get it fresh from the stocks like that as he probably was pleased to get your thanks . ' Ethelberta became reflective . She had not thanked Christopher ; moreover , she had decided , after some consideration , that she ought not to thank him . What new thoughts were suggested by that remark of Mrs. Doncastle 's , and what new inclination resulted from the public presentation of his tune and her words as parts of one organic whole , are best explained by describing her doings at a later hour , when , having left her friends somewhat early , she had reached home and retired from public view for that evening . Ethelberta went to her room , sent away the maid who did double duty for herself and Lady Petherwin , walked in circles about the carpet till the fire had grown haggard and cavernous , sighed , took a sheet of paper and wrote : -- 'DEAR MR. JULIAN , -- I have said I would not write : I have said it twice ; but discretion , under some circumstances , is only another name for unkindness . Before thanking you for your sweet gift , let me tell you in a few words of something which may materially change an aspect of affairs under which I appear to you to deserve it . 'With regard to my history and origin you are altogether mistaken ; and how can I tell whether your bitterness at my previous silence on those points may not cause you to withdraw your act of courtesy now ? But the gratification of having at last been honest with you may compensate even for the loss of your respect . 'The matter is a small one to tell , after all . What will you say on learning that I am not the trodden-down `` lady by birth '' that you have supposed me ? That my father is not dead , as you probably imagine ; that he is working for his living as one among a peculiarly stigmatized and ridiculed multitude ? 'Had he been a brawny cottager , carpenter , mason , blacksmith , well- digger , navvy , tree-feller -- any effective and manly trade , in short , a worker in which can stand up in the face of the noblest and daintiest , and bare his gnarled arms and say , with a consciousness of superior power , `` Look at a real man ! '' I should have been able to show you antecedents which , if not intensely romantic , are not altogether antagonistic to romance . But the present fashion of associating with one particular class everything that is ludicrous and bombastic overpowers me when I think of it in relation to myself and your known sensitiveness . When the well-born poetess of good report melts into . . . ' Having got thus far , a faint-hearted look , which had begun to show itself several sentences earlier , became pronounced . She threw the writing into the dull fire , poked and stirred it till a red inflammation crept over the sheet , and then started anew : -- 'DEAR MR. JULIAN , -- Not knowing your present rank as composer -- whether on the very brink of fame , or as yet a long way off -- I can not decide what form of expression my earnest acknowledgments",The Hand Of Ethelberta
Arthur Conan Doyle,"? ' said he . 'If you can give no reason against it . ' 'The only reason that I can think of , ' said the Bart , 'is that I should instantly cut your head off if you were to attempt it . ' 'Two can play at that game , my dear Bart , ' said I . 'Then we 'll see who can play at it best , ' he cried , pulling out his sword . I had drawn mine also , but I was quite determined not to hurt this admirable young man who had been my benefactor . 'Consider , ' said I , 'you say that I am your prisoner . I might with equal reason say that you are mine . We are alone here , and though I have no doubt that you are an excellent swordsman , you can hardly hope to hold your own against the best blade in the six light cavalry brigades . ' His answer was a cut at my head . I parried and shore off half of his white plume . He thrust at my breast . I turned his point and cut away the other half of his cockade . 'Curse your monkey-tricks ! ' he cried , as I wheeled my horse away from him . 'Why should you strike at me ? ' said I . 'You see that I will not strike back . ' 'That 's all very well , ' said he ; 'but you 've got to come along with me to the camp . ' ' I shall never see the camp , ' said I . ' I 'll lay you nine to four you do , ' he cried , as he made at me , sword in hand . But those words of his put something new into my head . Could we not decide the matter in some better way than fighting ? The Bart was placing me in such a position that I should have to hurt him , or he would certainly hurt me . I avoided his rush , though his sword-point was within an inch of my neck . ' I have a proposal , ' I cried . 'We shall throw dice as to which is the prisoner of the other . ' He smiled at this . It appealed to his love of sport . 'Where are your dice ? ' he cried . ' I have none . ' 'Nor I . But I have cards . ' 'Cards let it be , ' said I . 'And the game ? ' ' I leave it to you . ' 'Écarté , then -- the best of three . ' I could not help smiling as I agreed , for I do not suppose that there were three men in France who were my masters at the game . I told the Bart as much as we dismounted . He smiled also as he listened . ' I was counted the best player at Watier 's , ' said he . 'With even luck you deserve to get off if you beat me . ' So we tethered our two horses and sat down one on either side of a great flat rock . The Bart took a pack of cards out of his tunic , and I had only to see him shuffle to convince me that I had no novice to deal with . We cut , and the deal fell to him . My faith , it was a stake worth playing for . He wished to add a hundred gold pieces a game , but what was money when the fate of Colonel Etienne Gerard hung upon the cards ? I felt as though all those who had reason to be interested in the game -- my mother , my hussars , the Sixth Corps d'Armée , Ney , Massena , even the Emperor himself -- were forming a ring round us in that desolate valley . Heavens , what a blow to one and all of them should the cards go against me ! But I was confident , for my écarté play was as famous as my swordsmanship , and save old Bouvet of the Hussars of Bercheny , who won seventy-six out of one hundred and fifty games off me , I have always had the best of a series . The first game I won right off , though I must confess that the cards were with me , and that my adversary could have done no more . In the second , I never played better and saved a trick by a finesse , but the Bart voled me once , marked the king , and ran out in the second hand . My faith , we were so excited that he laid his helmet down beside him and I my busby . ' I 'll lay my roan mare against your black horse , ' said he . 'Done ! ' said I . 'Sword against sword . ' 'Done ! ' said I . 'Saddle , bridle , and stirrups ! ' he cried . 'Done ! ' I shouted . I had caught this spirit of sport from him . I would have laid my hussars against his dragoons had they been ours to pledge . And then began the game of games . Oh , he played , this Englishman -- he played in a way that was worthy of such a stake . But I , my friends , I was superb ! Of the five which I had to make to win , I gained three on the first hand . The Bart bit his moustache and drummed his hands , while I already felt myself at the head of my dear little rascals . On the second , I turned the king , but lost two tricks -- and my score was four to his two . When I saw my next hand I could not but give a cry of delight . 'If I can not gain my freedom on this , ' thought I , ' I deserve to remain for ever in chains . ' Give me the cards , landlord , and I will lay them out on the table for you . Here was my hand : knave and ace of clubs , queen and knave of diamonds , and king of hearts . Clubs were trumps , mark you , and I had but one point between me and freedom . He knew it was the crisis , and he undid his tunic . I threw my dolman on the ground . He led the ten of spades . I took it with my ace of trumps . One point in my favour . The correct play was to clear the trumps , and I led the knave . Down came the queen upon it , and the game was equal . He led the eight of spades , and I could only discard my queen of diamonds . Then came the seven of spades , and the hair stood straight up on my head . We each threw down a king at the final . He had won two points , and my beautiful hand had been mastered by his inferior one . I could have rolled on the ground as I thought of it . They used to play very good écarté at Watier 's in the year '10 . I say it -- I , Brigadier Gerard . The last game was now four all . This next hand must settle it one way or the other . He undid his sash , and I put away my sword-belt . He was cool , this Englishman , and I tried to be so also , but the perspiration would trickle into my eyes . The deal lay with him , and I may confess to you , my friends , that my hands shook so that I could hardly pick my cards from the rock . But when I raised them , what was the first thing that my eyes rested upon ? It was the king , the king , the glorious king of trumps ! My mouth was open to declare it when the words were frozen upon my lips by the appearance of my comrade . He held his cards in his hand , but his jaw had fallen , and his eyes were staring over my shoulder with the most dreadful expression of consternation and surprise . I whisked round , and I was myself amazed at what I saw . Three men were standing quite close to us -- fifteen mètres at the farthest . The middle one was of a good height , and yet not too tall -- about the same height , in fact , that I am myself . He was clad in a dark uniform with a small cocked hat , and some sort of white plume upon the side . But I had little thought of his dress . It was his face , his gaunt cheeks , his beak-like nose , his masterful blue eyes , his thin , firm slit of a mouth which made one feel that this was a wonderful man , a man of a million . His brows were tied into a knot , and he cast such a glance at my poor Bart from under them that one by one the cards came fluttering down from his nerveless fingers . Of the two other men , one , who had a face as brown and hard as though it had been carved out of old oak , wore a bright red coat , while the other , a fine portly man with bushy side-whiskers , was in a blue jacket with gold facings . Some little distance behind , three orderlies were holding as many horses , and an escort of dragoons was waiting in the rear . 'Heh , Crauford , what the deuce is this ? ' asked the thin man . 'D'you hear , sir ? ' cried the man with the red coat . 'Lord Wellington wants to know what this means . ' My poor Bart broke into an account of all that had occurred , but that rock-face never softened for an instant . 'Pretty fine , 'pon my word , General Crauford , ' he broke in . 'The discipline of this force must be maintained , sir . Report yourself at headquarters as a prisoner . ' It was dreadful to me to see the Bart mount his horse and ride off with hanging head . I could not endure it . I threw myself before this English General . I pleaded with him for my friend . I told him how I , Colonel Gerard , would witness what a dashing young officer he was . Ah , my eloquence might have melted the hardest heart ; I brought tears to my own eyes , but none to his . My voice broke , and I could say no more . 'What weight do you put on your mules , sir , in the French service ? ' he asked . Yes , that was all this phlegmatic Englishman had to answer to these burning words of mine . That was his reply to what would have made a Frenchman weep upon my shoulder . 'What weight on a mule ? ' asked the man with the red coat . 'Two hundred and ten pounds , ' said I . 'Then you load them deucedly badly , ' said Lord Wellington . 'Remove the prisoner to the rear . ' His dragoons closed in upon me , and I -- I was driven mad , as I thought that the game had been in my hands , and that I ought at that moment to be a free man . I held the cards up in front of the General . 'See , my lord ! ' I cried ; ' I played for my freedom and I won , for , as you perceive , I hold the king . ' For the first time a slight smile softened his gaunt face . 'On the contrary , ' said he , as he mounted his horse , 'it is I who won , for , as you perceive , my King holds you . ' 4 . HOW THE KING HELD THE BRIGADIER Murat was undoubtedly an excellent cavalry officer , but he had too much swagger , which spoils many a good soldier . Lasalle , too , was a very dashing leader , but he ruined himself with wine and folly . Now I , Etienne Gerard , was always totally devoid of swagger , and at the same time I was very abstemious , except , maybe , at the end of a campaign , or when I met an old comrade-in-arms . For these reasons I might , perhaps , had it not been for a certain diffidence , have claimed to be the most valuable officer in my own branch of the Service . It is true that I never rose to be more than a chief of brigade , but then , as everyone knows , no one had a chance of rising to the top unless he had the good fortune to be with the Emperor in his early campaigns . Except Lasalle , and Labau , and Drouet , I can hardly remember any one of the generals who had not already made his name before the Egyptian business . Even I , with all my brilliant qualities , could only attain the head of my brigade , and also the special medal of honour , which I received from the Emperor himself , and which I keep at home in a leathern pouch . But though I never rose higher than this , my qualities were very well known to those who had served with me , and also to the English . After they had captured me in the way which I described to you the other night , they kept a very good guard over me at Oporto , and I promise you that they did not give such a formidable opponent a chance of slipping through their fingers . It was on the 10th of August that I was escorted on board the transport which was to take us to England , and behold me before the end of the month in the great prison which had been built for us at Dartmoor ! ' L'hôtel Français , et Pension , ' we used to call it , for you understand that we were all brave men there , and that we did not lose our spirits because we were in adversity . It was only those officers who refused to give their parole who were confined at Dartmoor , and most of the prisoners were seamen , or from the ranks . You ask me , perhaps , why it was that I did not give this parole , and so enjoy the same good treatment as most of my brother officers . Well , I had two reasons , and both of them were sufficiently strong . In the first place , I had so much confidence in myself , that I was quite convinced that I could escape . In the second , my family , though of good repute , has never been wealthy , and I could not bring myself to take anything from the small income of my mother . On the other hand , it would never do for a man like me to be outshone by the bourgeois society of an English country town , or to be without the means of showing courtesies and attentions to those ladies whom I should attract . It was for these reasons that I preferred to be buried in the dreadful prison of Dartmoor . I wish now to tell you of my adventures in England , and how far Milor Wellington 's words were true when he said that his King would hold me . And first of all I may say that if it were not that I have set off to tell you about what befell myself , I could keep you here until morning with my stories about Dartmoor itself , and about the singular things which occurred there . It was one of the very strangest places in the whole world , for there , in the middle of that great desolate waste , were herded together seven or eight thousand men -- warriors , you understand , men of experience and courage . Around there were a double wall and a ditch , and warders and soldiers ; but , my faith ! you could not coop men like that up like rabbits in a hutch ! They would escape by twos and tens and twenties , and then the cannon would boom , and the search parties run , and we , who were left behind , would laugh and dance and shout 'Vive l'Empereur ' until the warders would turn their muskets upon us in their passion . And then we would have our little mutinies , too , and up would come the infantry and the guns from Plymouth , and that would set us yelling 'Vive l'Empereur ' once more , as though we wished them to hear us in Paris . We had lively moments at Dartmoor , and we contrived that those who were about us should be lively also . You must know that the prisoners there had their own Courts of Justice , in which they tried their own cases , and inflicted their own punishments . Stealing and quarrelling were punished -- but most of all treachery . When I came there first there was a man , Meunier , from Rheims , who had given information of some plot to escape . Well , that night , owing to some form or other which had to be gone through , they did not take him out from among the other prisoners , and though he wept and screamed , and grovelled upon the ground , they left him there amongst the comrades whom he had betrayed . That night there was a trial with a whispered accusation and a whispered defence , a gagged prisoner , and a judge whom none could see . In the morning , when they came for their man with papers for his release , there was not as much of him left as you could put upon your thumb-nail . They were ingenious people , these prisoners , and they had their own way of managing . We officers , however , lived in a separate wing , and a very singular group of people we were . They had left us our uniforms , so that there was hardly a corps which had served under Victor , or Massena , or Ney , which was not represented there , and some had been there from the time when Junot was beaten at Vimiera . We had chasseurs in their green tunics , and hussars , like myself , and blue-coated dragoons , and white-fronted lancers , and voltigeurs , and grenadiers , and the men of the artillery and engineers . But the greater part were naval officers , for the English had had the better of us upon the seas . I could never understand this until I journeyed myself from Oporto to Plymouth , when I lay for seven days upon my back , and could not have stirred had I seen the eagle of the regiment carried off before my eyes . It was in perfidious weather like this that Nelson took advantage of us . I had no sooner got into Dartmoor than I began to plan to get out again , and you can readily believe that , with wits sharpened by twelve years of warfare , it was not very long before I saw my way . You must know , in the first place , that I had a very great advantage in having some knowledge of the English language . I learned it during the months that I spent before Danzig , from Adjutant Obriant , of the Regiment Irlandais , who was sprung from the ancient kings of the country . I was quickly able to speak it with some facility , for I do not take long to master anything to which I set my mind . In three months I could not only express my meaning , but I could use the idioms of the people . It was Obriant who taught me to say 'Be jabers , ' just as we might say 'Ma foi ' ; and also 'The curse of Crummle ! ' which means 'Ventre bleu ! ' Many a time I have seen the English smile with pleasure when they have heard me speak so much like one of themselves . We officers were put two in a cell , which was very little to my taste , for my room-mate was a tall , silent man named Beaumont , of the Flying Artillery , who had been taken by the English cavalry at Astorga . It is seldom I meet a man of whom I can not make a friend , for my disposition and manners are -- as you know them . But this fellow had never a smile for my jests , nor an ear for my sorrows , but would sit looking at me with his sullen eyes , until sometimes I thought that his two years of captivity had driven him crazy . Ah , how I longed that old Bouvet , or any of my comrades of the hussars , was there , instead of this mummy of a man . But such as he was I had to make the best of him , and it was very evident that no escape could be made unless he were my partner in it , for what could I possibly do without him observing me ? I hinted at it , therefore , and then by degrees I spoke more plainly , until it seemed to me that I had prevailed upon him to share my lot . I tried the walls , and I tried the floor , and I tried the ceiling , but though I tapped and probed , they all appeared to be very thick and solid . The door was of iron , shutting with a spring lock , and provided with a small grating , through which a warder looked twice in every night . Within there were two beds , two stools , two washstands -- nothing more . It was enough for my wants , for when had I had as much during those twelve years spent in camps ? But how was I to get out ? Night after night I thought of my five hundred hussars , and had dreadful nightmares , in which I fancied that the whole regiment needed shoeing , or that my horses were all bloated with green fodder , or that they were foundered from bogland , or that six squadrons were clubbed in the presence of the Emperor . Then I would awake in a cold sweat , and set to work picking and tapping at the walls once more ; for I knew very well that there is no difficulty which can not be overcome by a ready brain and a pair of cunning hands . There was a single window in our cell , which was too small to admit a child . It was further defended by a thick iron bar in the centre . It was not a very promising point of escape , as you will allow , but I became more and more convinced that our efforts must be directed towards it . To make matters worse , it only led out into the exercise yard , which was surrounded by two high walls . Still , as I said to my sullen comrade , it is time to talk of the Vistula when you are over the Rhine . I got a small piece of iron , therefore , from the fittings of my bed , and I set to work to loosen the plaster at the top and the bottom of the bar . Three hours I would work , and then leap into my bed upon the sound of the warder 's step . Then another three hours , and then very often another yet , for I found that Beaumont was so slow and clumsy at it that it was on myself only that I could rely . I pictured to myself my Third of Hussars waiting just outside that window , with kettle-drums and standards and leopard-skin schabraques all complete . Then I would work like a madman , until my iron was crusted with blood , as if with rust . And so , night by night , I loosened that stony plaster , and hid it away in the stuffing of my pillow , until the hour came when the iron shook ; and then with one good wrench it came off in my hand , and my first step had been made towards freedom . You will ask me what better off I was , since , as I have said , a child could not have fitted through the opening . I will tell you . I had gained two things -- a tool and a weapon . With the one I might loosen the stone which flanked the window . With the other I might defend myself when I had scrambled through . So now I turned my attention to that stone , and I picked and picked with the sharpened end of my bar until I had worked out the mortar all round . You understand , of course , that during the day I replaced everything in its position , and that the warder was never permitted to see a speck upon the floor . At the end of three weeks I had separated the stone , and had the rapture of drawing it through , and seeing a hole left with ten stars shining through it , where there had been but four before . All was ready for us now , and I had replaced the stone , smearing the edges of it round with a little fat and soot , so as to hide the cracks where the mortar should have been . In three nights the moon would be gone , and that seemed the best time for our attempt . I had now no doubt at all about getting into the yards , but I had very considerable misgivings as to how I was to get out again . It would be too humiliating , after trying here , and trying there , to have to go back to my hole again in despair , or to be arrested by the guards outside , and thrown into those damp underground cells which are reserved for prisoners who are caught in escaping . I set to work , therefore , to plan what I should do . I have never , as you know , had the chance of showing what I could do as a general . Sometimes , after a glass or two of wine , I have found myself capable of thinking out surprising combinations , and have felt that if Napoleon had intrusted me with an army corps , things might have gone differently with him . But however that may be , there is no doubt that in the small stratagems of war , and in that quickness of invention which is so necessary for an officer of light cavalry , I could hold my own against anyone . It was now that I had need of it , and I felt sure that it would not fail me . The inner wall which I had to scale was built of bricks , 12ft . high , with a row of iron spikes , 3in . apart upon the top . The outer I had only caught a glimpse of once or twice , when the gate of the exercise yard was open . It appeared to be about the same height , and was also spiked at the top . The space between the walls was over twenty feet , and I had reason to believe that there were no sentries there , except at the gates . On the other hand , I knew that there was a line of soldiers outside . Behold the little nut , my friends , which I had to open with no crackers , save these two hands . One thing upon which I relied was the height of my comrade Beaumont . I have already said that he was a very tall man , six feet at least , and it seemed to me that if I could mount upon his shoulders , and get my hands upon the spikes , I could easily scale the wall . Could I pull my big companion up after me ? That was the question , for when I set forth with a comrade , even though it be one for whom I bear no affection , nothing on earth would make me abandon him . If I climbed the wall and he could not follow me , I should be compelled to return to him . He did not seem to concern himself much about it , however , so I hoped that he had confidence in his own activity . Then another very important matter was the choice of the sentry who should be on duty in front of my window at the time of our attempt . They were changed every two hours to insure their vigilance , but I , who watched them closely each night out of my window , knew that there was a great difference between them . There were some who were so keen that a rat could not cross the yard unseen , while others thought only of their own ease , and could sleep as soundly leaning upon a musket as if they were at home upon a feather bed . There was one especially , a fat , heavy man , who would retire into the shadow of the wall and doze so comfortably during his two hours , that I have dropped pieces of plaster from my window at his very feet , without his observing it . By good luck , this fellow 's watch was due from twelve to two upon the night which we had fixed upon for our enterprise . As the last day passed , I was so filled with nervous agitation that I could not control myself , but ran ceaselessly about my cell , like a mouse in a cage . Every moment I thought that the warder would detect the looseness of the bar , or that the sentry would observe the unmortared stone , which I could not conceal outside , as I did within . As for my companion , he sat brooding upon the end of his bed , looking at me in a sidelong fashion from time to time , and biting his nails like one who is deep in thought . 'Courage , my friend ! ' I cried , slapping him upon the shoulder . 'You will see your guns before another month be past . ' 'That is very well , ' said he . 'But whither will you fly when you get free ? ' 'To the coast , ' I answered . 'All comes right for a brave man , and I shall make straight for my regiment . ' 'You are more likely to make straight for the underground cells , or for the Portsmouth hulks , ' said he . ' A soldier takes his chances , ' I remarked . 'It is only the poltroon who reckons always upon the worst . ' I raised a flush in each of his sallow cheeks at that , and I was glad of it , for it was the first sign of spirit which I had ever observed in him . For a moment he put his hand out towards his water-jug , as though he would have hurled it at me , but then he shrugged his shoulders and sat in silence once more , biting his nails , and scowling down at the floor . I could not but think , as I looked at him , that perhaps I was doing the Flying Artillery a very bad service by bringing him back to them . I never in my life have known an evening pass as slowly as that one . Towards nightfall a wind sprang up , and as the darkness deepened it blew harder and harder , until a terrible gale was whistling over the moor . As I looked out of my window I could not catch a glimpse of a star , and the black clouds were flying low across the heavens . The rain was pouring down , and what with its hissing and splashing , and the howling and screaming of the wind , it was impossible for me to hear the steps of the sentinels . 'If I can not hear them , ' thought I , 'then it is unlikely that they can hear me ' ; and I waited with the utmost impatience until the time when the inspector should have come round for his nightly peep through our grating . Then having peered through the darkness , and seen nothing of the sentry , who was doubtless crouching in some corner out of the rain , I felt that the moment was come . I removed the bar , pulled out the stone , and motioned to my companion to pass through . 'After you , Colonel , ' said he . 'Will you not go first ? ' I asked . ' I had rather you showed me the way . ' 'Come after me , then , but come silently , as you value your life . ' In the darkness I could hear the fellow 's teeth chattering , and I wondered whether a man ever had such a partner in a desperate enterprise . I seized the bar , however , and mounting upon my stool , I thrust my head and shoulders into the hole . I had wriggled through as far as my waist , when my companion seized me suddenly by the knees , and yelled at the top of his voice : 'Help ! Help ! A prisoner is escaping ! ' Ah , my friends , what did I not feel at that moment ! Of course , I saw in an instant the game of this vile creature . Why should he risk his skin in climbing walls when he might be sure of a free pardon from the English for having prevented the escape of one so much more distinguished than himself ? I had recognized him as a poltroon and a sneak , but I had not understood the depth of baseness to which he could descend . One who has spent his life among gentlemen and men of honour does not think of such things until they happen . The blockhead did not seem to understand that he was lost more certainly than I. I writhed back in the darkness , and seizing him by the throat , I struck him twice with my iron bar . At the first blow he yelped as a little cur does when you tread upon its paw . At the second , down he fell with a groan upon the floor . Then I seated myself upon my bed , and waited resignedly for whatever punishment my gaolers might inflict upon me . But a minute passed and yet another , with no sound save the heavy , snoring breathing of the senseless wretch upon the floor . Was it possible , then , that amid the fury of the storm his warning cries had passed unheeded ? At first it was but a tiny hope , another minute and it was probable , another and it was certain . There was no sound in the corridor , none in the courtyard . I wiped the cold sweat from my brow , and asked myself what I should do next . One thing seemed certain . The man on the floor must die . If I left him I could not tell how short a time it might be before he gave the alarm . I dare not strike a light , so I felt about in the darkness until my hand came upon something wet , which I knew to be his head . I raised my iron bar , but there was something , my friends , which prevented me from bringing it down . In the heat of fight I have slain many men -- men of honour , too , who had done me no injury . Yet here was this wretch , a creature too foul to live , who had tried to work me so great a mischief , and yet I could not bring myself to crush his skull in . Such deeds are very well for a Spanish partida -- or for that matter a sansculotte of the Faubourg St Antoine -- but not for a soldier and a gentleman like me . However , the heavy breathing of the fellow made me hope that it might be a very long time before he recovered his senses . I gagged him , therefore , and bound him with strips of blanket to the bed , so that in his weakened condition there was good reason to think that , in any case , he might not get free before the next visit of the warder . But now again I was faced with new difficulties , for you will remember that I had relied upon his height to help me over the walls . I could have sat down and shed tears of despair had not the thought of my mother and of the Emperor come to sustain me . 'Courage ! ' said I . 'If it were anyone but Etienne Gerard he would be in a bad fix now ; that is a young man who is not so easily caught . ' I set to work therefore upon Beaumont 's sheet as well as my own , and by tearing them into strips and then plaiting them together , I made a very excellent rope . This I tied securely to the centre of my iron bar , which was a little over a foot in length . Then I slipped out into the yard , where the rain was pouring and the wind screaming louder than ever . I kept in the shadow of the prison wall , but it was as black as the ace of spades , and I could not see my own hand in front of me . Unless I walked into the sentinel I felt that I had nothing to fear from him . When I had come under the wall I threw up my bar , and to my joy it stuck the very first time between the spikes at the top . I climbed up my rope , pulled it after me , and dropped down on the other side . Then I scaled the second wall , and was sitting astride among the spikes upon the top , when I saw something twinkle in the darkness beneath me . It was the bayonet of the sentinel below , and so close was it ( the second wall being rather lower than the first ) that I could easily , by leaning over , have unscrewed it from its socket . There he was , humming a tune to himself , and cuddling up against the wall to keep himself warm , little thinking that a desperate man within a few feet of him was within an ace of stabbing him to the heart with his own weapon . I was already bracing myself for the spring when the fellow , with an oath , shouldered his musket , and I heard his steps squelching through the mud as he resumed his beat . I slipped down my rope , and , leaving it hanging , I ran at the top of my speed across the moor . Heavens , how I ran ! The wind buffeted my face and buzzed in my nostrils . The rain pringled upon my skin and hissed past my ears . I stumbled into holes . I tripped over bushes . I fell among brambles . I was torn and breathless and bleeding . My tongue was like leather , my feet like lead , and my heart beating like a kettle-drum . Still I ran , and I ran , and I ran . But I had not lost my head , my friends . Everything was done with a purpose . Our fugitives always made for the coast . I was determined to go inland , and the more so as I had told Beaumont the opposite . I would fly to the north , and they would seek me in the south . Perhaps you will ask me how I could tell which was which on such a night . I answer that it was by the wind . I had observed in the prison that it came from the north , and so , as long as I kept my face to it , I was going in the right direction . Well , I was rushing along in this fashion when , suddenly , I saw two yellow lights shining out of the darkness in front of me . I paused for a moment , uncertain what I should do . I was still in my hussar uniform , you understand , and it seemed to me that the very first thing that I should aim at was to get some dress which should not betray me . If these lights came from a cottage , it was probable enough that I might find what I wanted there . I approached , therefore , feeling very sorry that I had left my iron bar behind ; for I was determined to fight to the death before I should be retaken . But very soon I found that there was no cottage there . The lights were two lamps hung upon each side of a carriage , and by their glare I saw that a broad road lay in front of me . Crouching among the bushes , I observed that there were two horses to the equipage , that a small post-boy was standing at their heads , and that one of the wheels was lying in the road beside him . I can see them now , my friends : the steaming creatures , the stunted lad with his hands to their bits , and the big , black coach , all shining with the rain , and balanced upon its three wheels . As I looked , the window was lowered , and a pretty little face under a bonnet peeped out from it . 'What shall I do ? ' the lady cried to the post-boy , in a voice of despair . 'Sir Charles is certainly lost , and I shall have to spend the night upon the moor . ' 'Perhaps I can be of some assistance to madame , ' said I , scrambling out from among the bushes into the glare of the lamps . A woman in distress is a sacred thing to me , and this one was beautiful . You must not forget that , although I was a colonel , I was only eight-and-twenty years of age . My word , how she screamed , and how the post-boy stared ! You will understand that after that long race in the darkness , with my shako broken in , my face smeared with dirt , and my uniform all stained and torn with brambles , I was not entirely the sort of gentleman whom one would choose to meet in the middle of a lonely moor . Still , after the first surprise , she soon understood that I was her very humble servant , and I could even read in her pretty eyes that my manner and bearing had not failed to produce an impression upon her . ' I am sorry to have startled you , madame , ' said I . ' I chanced to overhear your remark , and I could not refrain from offering you my assistance . ' I bowed as I spoke . You know my bow , and can realize what its effect was upon the lady . ' I am much indebted to you , sir , ' said she . 'We have had a terrible journey since we left Tavistock . Finally , one of our wheels came off , and here we are helpless in the middle of the moor . My husband , Sir Charles , has gone on to get help , and I much fear that he must have lost his way . ' I was about to attempt some consolation , when I saw beside the lady a black travelling coat , faced with astrakhan , which her companion must have left behind him . It was exactly what I needed to conceal my uniform . It is true that I felt very much like a highway robber , but then , what would you have ? Necessity has no law , and I was in an enemy's country . ' I presume , madame , that this is your husband 's coat , ' I remarked . 'You will , I am sure , forgive me , if I am compelled to -- ' I pulled it through the window as I spoke . I could not bear to see the look of surprise and fear and disgust which came over her face . 'Oh , I have been mistaken in you ! ' she cried . 'You came to rob me , then , and not to help me . You have the bearing of a gentleman , and yet you steal my husband 's coat . ' 'Madame , ' said I , ' I beg that you will not condemn me until you know everything . It is quite necessary that I should take this coat , but if you will have the goodness to tell me who it is who is fortunate enough to be your husband , I shall see that the coat is sent back to him . ' Her face softened a little , though she still tried to look severe . 'My husband , ' she answered , 'is Sir Charles Meredith , and he is travelling to Dartmoor Prison , upon important Government business . I only ask you , sir , to go upon your way , and to take nothing which belongs to him . ' 'There is only one thing which belongs to him that I covet , ' said I . 'And you have taken it from the carriage , ' she cried . 'No , ' I answered . 'It still remains there . ' She laughed in her frank English way . 'If , instead of paying me compliments , you were to return my husband's coat -- ' she began . 'Madame , ' I answered , 'what you ask is quite impossible . If you will allow me to come into the carriage , I will explain to you how necessary this coat is to me . ' Heaven knows into what foolishness I might have plunged myself had we not , at this instant , heard a faint halloa in the distance , which was answered by a shout from the little post-boy . In the rain and the darkness , I saw a lantern some distance from us , but approaching rapidly . ' I am sorry , madame , that I am forced to leave you , ' said I . 'You can assure your husband that I shall take every care of his coat . ' Hurried as I was , I ventured to pause a moment to salute the lady 's hand , which she snatched through the window with an admirable pretence of being offended at my presumption . Then , as the lantern was quite close to me , and the post-boy seemed inclined to interfere with my flight , I tucked my precious overcoat under my arm , and dashed off into the darkness . And now I set myself to the task of putting as broad a stretch of moor between the prison and myself as the remaining hours of darkness would allow . Setting my face to the wind once more , I ran until I fell from exhaustion . Then , after five minutes of panting among the heather , I made another start , until again my knees gave way beneath me . I was young and hard , with muscles of steel , and a frame which had been toughened by twelve years of camp and field . Thus I was able to keep up this wild flight for another three hours , during which I still guided myself , you understand , by keeping the wind in my face . At the end of that time I calculated that I had put nearly twenty miles between the prison and myself . Day was about to break , so I crouched down among the heather upon the top of one of those small hills which abound in that country , with the intention of hiding myself until nightfall . It was no new thing for me to sleep in the wind and the rain , so , wrapping myself up in my thick warm cloak , I soon sank into a doze . But it was not a refreshing slumber . I tossed and tumbled amid a series of vile dreams , in which everything seemed to go wrong with me . At last , I remember , I was charging an unshaken square of Hungarian Grenadiers , with a single squadron upon spent horses , just as I did at Elchingen . I stood in my stirrups to shout 'Vive l'Empereur ! ' and as I did so , there came the answering roar from my hussars , 'Vive l'Empereur ! ' I sprang from my rough bed , with the words still ringing in my ears , and then , as I rubbed my eyes , and wondered if I were mad , the same cry came again , five thousand voices in one long-drawn yell . I looked out from my screen of brambles , and saw in the clear light of morning the very last thing that I should either have expected or chosen . It was Dartmoor Prison ! There it stretched , grim and hideous , within a furlong of me . Had I run on for a few more minutes in the dark , I should have butted my shako against the wall . I was so taken aback at the sight , that I could scarcely realize what had happened . Then it all became clear to me , and I struck my head with my hands in my despair . The wind had veered from north to south during the night , and I , keeping my face always towards it , had run ten miles out and ten miles in , winding up where I had started . When I thought of my hurry , my falls , my mad rushing and jumping , all ending in this , it seemed so absurd , that my grief changed suddenly to amusement , and I fell among the brambles , and laughed , and laughed , until my sides were sore . Then I rolled myself up in my cloak and considered seriously what I should do . One lesson which I have learned in my roaming life , my friends , is never to call anything a misfortune until you have seen the end of it . Is not every hour a fresh point of view ? In this case I soon perceived that accident had done for me as much as the most profound cunning . My guards naturally commenced their search from the place where I had taken Sir Charles Meredith 's coat , and from my hiding-place I could see them hurrying along the road to that point . Not one of them ever dreamed that I could have doubled back from there , and I lay quite undisturbed in the little bush-covered cup at the summit of my knoll . The prisoners had , of course , learned of my escape , and all day exultant yells , like that which had aroused me in the morning , resounded over the moor , bearing a welcome message of sympathy and companionship to my ears . How little did they dream that on the top of that very mound , which they could see from their windows , was lying the comrade whose escape they were celebrating ? As for me -- I could look down upon this poor herd of idle warriors , as they paced about the great exercise yard , or gathered in little groups , gesticulating joyfully over my success . Once I heard a howl of execration , and I saw Beaumont , his head all covered with bandages , being led across the yard by two of the warders . I can not tell you the pleasure which this sight gave me , for it proved that I had not killed him , and also that the others knew the true story of what had passed . They had all known me too well to think that I could have abandoned him . All that long day I lay behind my screen of bushes , listening to the bells which struck the hours below . My pockets were filled with bread which I had saved out of my allowance , and on searching my borrowed overcoat I came upon a silver flask , full of excellent brandy and water , so that I was able to get through the day without hardship . The only other things in the pockets were a red silk handkerchief , a tortoise-shell snuff-box , and a blue envelope , with a red seal , addressed to the Governor of Dartmoor Prison . As to the first two , I determined to send them back when I should return the coat itself . The letter caused me more perplexity , for the Governor had always shown me every courtesy , and it offended my sense of honour that I should interfere with his correspondence . I had almost made up my mind to leave it under a stone upon the roadway within musket-shot of the gate . This would guide them in their search for me , however , and so , on the whole , I saw no better way than just to carry the letter with me in the hope that I might find some means of sending it back to him . Meanwhile I packed it safely away in my inner-most pocket . There was a warm sun to dry my clothes , and when night fell I was ready for my journey . I promise you that there were no mistakes this time . I took the stars for my guides , as every hussar should be taught to do , and I put eight good leagues between myself and the prison . My plan now was to obtain a complete suit of clothes from the first person whom I could waylay , and I should then find my way to the north coast , where there were many smugglers and fishermen who would be ready to earn the reward which was paid by the Emperor to those who brought escaping prisoners across the Channel . I had taken the panache from my shako so that it might escape notice , but even with my fine overcoat I feared that sooner or later my uniform would betray me . My first care must be to provide myself with a complete disguise . When day broke , I saw a river upon my right and a small town upon my left -- the blue smoke reeking up above the moor . I should have liked well to have entered it , because it would have interested me to see something of the customs of the English , which differ very much from those of other nations . Much as I should have wished , however , to have seen them eat their raw meat and sell their wives , it would have been dangerous until I had got rid of my uniform . My cap , my moustache , and my speech would all help to betray me . I continued to travel towards the north therefore , looking about me continually , but never catching a glimpse of my pursuers . About midday I came to where , in a secluded valley , there stood a single small cottage without any other building in sight . It was a neat little house , with a rustic porch and a small garden in front of it , with a swarm of cocks and hens . I lay down among the ferns and watched it , for it seemed to be exactly the kind of place where I might obtain what I wanted . My bread was finished , and I was exceedingly hungry after my long journey ; I determined , therefore , to make a short reconnaissance , and then to march up to this cottage , summon it to surrender , and help myself to all that I needed . It could at least provide me with a chicken and with an omelette . My mouth watered at the thought . As I lay there , wondering who could live in this lonely place , a brisk little fellow came out through the porch , accompanied by another older man , who carried two large clubs in his hands . These he handed to his young companion , who swung them up and down , and round and round , with extraordinary swiftness . The other , standing beside him , appeared to watch him with great attention , and occasionally to advise him . Finally he took a rope , and began skipping like a girl , the other still gravely observing him . As you may think , I was utterly puzzled as to what these people could be , and could only surmise that the one was a doctor , and the other a patient who had submitted himself to some singular method of treatment . Well , as I lay watching and wondering , the older man brought out a great-coat , and held it while the other put it on and buttoned it to his chin . The day was a warmish one , so that this proceeding amazed me even more than the other . 'At least , ' thought I , 'it is evident that his exercise is over ' ; but , far from this being so , the man began to run , in spite of his heavy coat , and as it chanced , he came right over the moor in my direction . His companion had re-entered the house , so that this arrangement suited me admirably . I would take the small man 's clothing , and hurry on to some village where I could buy provisions . The chickens were certainly tempting , but still there were at least two men in the house , so perhaps it would be wiser for me , since I had no arms , to keep away from it . I lay quietly then among the ferns . Presently I heard the steps of the runner , and there he was quite close to me , with his huge coat , and the perspiration running down his face . He seemed to be a very solid man -- but small -- so small that I feared that his clothes might be of little use to me . When I jumped out upon him he stopped running , and looked at me in the greatest astonishment . 'Blow my dickey , ' said he , 'give it a name , guv'nor ! Is it a circus , or what ? ' That was how he talked , though I can not pretend to tell you what he meant by it . 'You will excuse me , sir , ' said I , 'but I am under the necessity of asking you to give me your clothes . ' 'Give you what ? ' he cried . 'Your clothes . ' 'Well , if this do n't lick cock-fighting ! ' said he . 'What am I to give you my clothes for ? ' 'Because I need them . ' 'And suppose I wo n't ? ' 'Be jabers , ' said I , ' I shall have no choice but to take them . ' He stood with his hands in the pockets of his great-coat , and a most amused smile upon his square-jawed , clean-shaven face . 'You 'll take them , will you ? ' said he . 'You 're a very leery cove , by the look of you , but I can tell you that you 've got the wrong sow by the ear this time . I know who you are . You 're a runaway Frenchy , from the prison yonder , as anyone could tell with half an eye . But you do n't know who I am , else you would n't try such a plant as that . Why , man , I 'm the Bristol Bustler , nine stone champion , and them 's my training quarters down yonder . ' He stared at me as if this announcement of his would have crushed me to the earth , but I smiled at him in my turn , and looked him up and down , with a twirl of my moustache . 'You may be a very brave man , sir , ' said I , 'but when I tell you that you are opposed to Colonel Etienne Gerard , of the Hussars of Conflans , you will see the necessity of giving up your clothes without further parley . ' 'Look here , mounseer , drop it ! ' he cried ; 'this 'll end by your getting pepper . ' 'Your clothes , sir , this instant ! ' I shouted , advancing fiercely upon him . For answer he threw off his heavy great-coat , and stood in a singular attitude , with one arm out , and the other across his chest , looking at me with a curious smile . For myself , I knew nothing of the methods of fighting which these people have , but on horse or on foot , with arms or without them , I am always ready to take my own part . You understand that a soldier can not always choose his own methods , and that it is time to howl when you are living among wolves . I rushed at him , therefore , with a warlike shout , and kicked him with both my feet . At the same moment my heels flew into the air , I saw as many flashes as at Austerlitz , and the back of my head came down with a crash upon a stone . After that I can remember nothing more . When I came to myself I was lying upon a truckle-bed , in a bare , half-furnished room . My head was ringing like a bell , and when I put up my hand , there was a lump like a walnut over one of my eyes . My nose was full of a pungent smell , and I soon found that a strip of paper soaked in vinegar was fastened across my brow . At the other end of the room this terrible little man was sitting with his knee bare , and his elderly companion was rubbing it with some liniment . The latter seemed to be in the worst of tempers , and he kept up a continual scolding , which the other listened to with a gloomy face . 'Never heard tell of such a thing in my life , ' he was saying . 'In training for a month with all the weight of it on my shoulders , and then when I get you as fit as a trout , and within two days of fighting the likeliest man on the list , you let yourself into a by-battle with a foreigner . ' 'There , there ! Stow your gab ! ' said the other , sulkily . 'You 're a very good trainer , Jim , but you 'd be better with less jaw . ' ' I should think it was time to jaw , ' the elderly man answered . 'If this knee do n't get well before next Wednesday , they 'll have it that you fought a cross , and a pretty job you 'll have next time you look for a backer . ' 'Fought a cross ! ' growled the other . ' I 've won nineteen battles , and no man ever so much as dared to say the word `` cross '' in my hearin ' . How the deuce was I to get out of it when the cove wanted the very clothes off my back ? ' 'Tut , man ; you knew that the beak and the guards were within a mile of you . You could have set them on to him as well then as now . You 'd have got your clothes back again all right . ' 'Well , strike me ! ' said the Bustler . ' I do n't often break my trainin ' , but when it comes to givin ' up my clothes to a Frenchy who could n't hit a dint in a pat o ' butter , why , it 's more than I can swaller . ' 'Pooh , man , what are the clothes worth ? D'you know that Lord Rufton alone has five thousand pounds on you ? When you jump the ropes on Wednesday , you 'll carry every penny of fifty thousand into the ring . A pretty thing to turn up with a swollen knee and a story about a Frenchman ! ' ' I never thought he 'd ha ' kicked , ' said the Bustler . ' I suppose you expected he 'd fight Broughton 's rules , and strict P.R. ? Why , you silly , they do n't know what fighting is in France . ' 'My friends , ' said I , sitting up on my bed , ' I do not understand very much of what you say , but when you speak like that it is foolishness . We know so much about fighting in France , that we have paid our little visit to nearly every capital in Europe , and very soon we are coming to London . But we fight like soldiers , you understand , and not like gamins in the gutter . You strike me on the head . I kick you on the knee . It is child 's play . But if you will give me a sword , and take another one , I will show you how we fight over the water . ' They both stared at me in their solid , English way . 'Well , I 'm glad you 're not dead , mounseer , ' said the elder one at last . 'There was n't much sign of life in you when the Bustler and me carried you down . That head of yours ai n't thick enough to stop the crook of the hardest hitter in Bristol . ' 'He 's a game cove , too , and he came for me like a bantam , ' said the other , still rubbing his knee . ' I got my old left-right in , and he went over as if he had been pole-axed . It was n't my fault , mounseer . I told you you 'd get pepper if you went on . ' 'Well , it 's something to say all your life , that you 've been handled by the finest light-weight in England , ' said the older man , looking at me with an expression of congratulation upon his face . 'You 've had him at his best , too -- in the pink of condition , and trained by Jim Hunter . ' ' I am used to hard knocks , ' said I , unbuttoning my tunic , and showing my two musket wounds . Then I bared my ankle also , and showed the place in my eye where the guerilla had stabbed me . 'He can take his gruel , ' said the Bustler . 'What a glutton he 'd have made for the middle-weights , ' remarked the trainer ; 'with six months ' coaching he 'd astonish the fancy . It 's a pity he 's got to go back to prison . ' I did not like that last remark at all . I buttoned up my coat and rose from the bed . ' I must ask you to let me continue my journey , ' said I . 'There 's no help for it , mounseer , ' the trainer answered . 'It 's a hard thing to send such a man as you back to such a place , but business is business , and there 's a twenty pound reward . They were here this morning , looking for you , and I expect they 'll be round again . ' His words turned my heart to lead . 'Surely , you would not betray me ! ' I cried . ' I will send you twice twenty pounds on the day that I set foot upon France . I swear it upon the honour of a French gentleman . ' But I only got head-shakes for a reply . I pleaded , I argued , I spoke of the English hospitality and the fellowship of brave men , but I might as well have been addressing the two great wooden clubs which stood balanced upon the floor in front of me . There was no sign of sympathy upon their bull-faces . 'Business is business , mounseer , ' the old trainer repeated . 'Besides , how am I to put the Bustler into the ring on Wednesday if he 's jugged by the beak for aidin ' and abettin ' a prisoner of war ? I 've got to look after the Bustler , and I take no risks . ' This , then , was the end of all my struggles and strivings . I was to be led back again like a poor silly sheep who has broken through the hurdles . They little knew me who could fancy that I should submit to such a fate . I had heard enough to tell me where the weak point of these two men was , and I showed , as I have often showed before , that Etienne Gerard is never so terrible as when all hope seems to have deserted him . With a single spring I seized one of the clubs and swung it over the head of the Bustler . 'Come what may , ' I cried , '_you_ shall be spoiled for Wednesday . ' The fellow growled out an oath , and would have sprung at me , but the other flung his arms round him and pinned him to the chair . 'Not if I know it , Bustler , ' he screamed . 'None of your games while I am by . Get away out of this , Frenchy . We only want to see your back . Run away , run away , or he 'll get loose ! ' It was good advice , I thought , and I ran to the door , but as I came out into the open air my head swam round and I had to lean against the porch to save myself from falling . Consider all that I had been through , the anxiety of my escape , the long , useless flight in the storm , the day spent amid wet ferns , with only bread for food , the second journey by night , and now the injuries which I had received in attempting to deprive the little man of his clothes . Was it wonderful that even I should reach the limits of my endurance ? I stood there in my heavy coat and my poor battered shako , my chin upon my chest , and my eyelids over my eyes . I had done my best , and I could do no more . It was the sound of horses ' hoofs which made me at last raise my head , and there was the grey-moustached Governor of Dartmoor Prison not ten paces in front of me , with six mounted warders behind him ! 'So , Colonel , ' said he , with a bitter smile , 'we have found you once more . ' When a brave man has done his utmost , and has failed , he shows his breeding by the manner in which he accepts his defeat . For me , I took the letter which I had in my pocket , and stepping forward , I handed it with such grace of manner as I could summon to the Governor . 'It has been my misfortune , sir , to detain one of your letters , ' said I . He looked at me in amazement , and beckoned to the warders to arrest me . Then he broke the seal of the letter . I saw a curious expression come over his face as he read it . 'This must be the letter which Sir Charles Meredith lost , ' said he . 'It was in the pocket of his coat . ' 'You have carried it for two days ? ' 'Since the night before last . ' 'And never looked at the contents ? ' I showed him by my manner that he had committed an indiscretion in asking a question which one gentleman should not have put to another . To my surprise he burst out into a roar of laughter . 'Colonel , ' said he , wiping the tears from his eyes , 'you have really given both yourself and us a great deal of unnecessary trouble . Allow me to read the letter which you carried with you in your flight . ' And this was what I heard : -- 'On receipt of this you are directed to release Colonel Etienne Gerard , of the 3rd Hussars , who has been exchanged against Colonel Mason , of the Horse Artillery , now in Verdun . ' And as he read it , he laughed again , and the warders laughed , and the two men from the cottage laughed , and then , as I heard this universal merriment , and thought of all my hopes and fears , and my struggles and dangers , what could a debonair soldier do but lean against the porch once more , and laugh as heartily as any of them ? And of them all was it not I who had the best reason to laugh , since in front of me I could see my dear France , and my mother , and the Emperor , and my horsemen ; while behind lay the gloomy prison , and the heavy hand of the English King ? 5 . HOW THE BRIGADIER TOOK THE FIELD AGAINST THE MARSHAL MILLEFLEURS Massena was a thin , sour little fellow , and after his hunting accident he had only one eye , but when it looked out from under his cocked hat there was not much upon a field of battle which escaped it . He could stand in front of a battalion , and with a single sweep tell you if a buckle or a gaiter button were out of place . Neither the officers nor the men were very fond of him , for he was , as you know , a miser , and soldiers love that their leaders should be free-handed . At the same time , when it came to work they had a very high respect for him , and they would rather fight under him than under anyone except the Emperor himself , and Lannes , when he was alive . After all , if he had a tight grasp upon his money-bags , there was a day also , you must remember , when that same grip was upon Zurich and Genoa . He clutched on to his positions as he did to his strong box , and it took a very clever man to loosen him from either . When I received his summons I went gladly to his headquarters , for I was always a great favourite of his , and there was no officer of whom he thought more highly . That was the best of serving with those good old generals , that they knew enough to be able to pick out a fine soldier when they saw one . He was seated alone in his tent , with his chin upon his hand , and his brow as wrinkled as if he had been asked for a subscription . He smiled , however , when he saw me before him . 'Good day , Colonel Gerard . ' 'Good day , Marshal . ' 'How is the Third of Hussars ? ' 'Seven hundred incomparable men upon seven hundred excellent horses . ' 'And your wounds -- are they healed ? ' 'My wounds never heal , Marshal , ' I answered . 'And why ? ' 'Because I have always new ones . ' 'General Rapp must look to his laurels , ' said he , his face all breaking into wrinkles as he laughed . 'He has had twenty-one from the enemy's bullets , and as many from Larrey 's knives and probes . Knowing that you were hurt , Colonel , I have spared you of late . ' 'Which hurt me most of all . ' 'Tut , tut ! Since the English got behind these accursed lines of Torres Vedras , there has been little for us to do . You did not miss much during your imprisonment at Dartmoor . But now we are on the eve of action . ' 'We advance ? ' 'No , retire . ' My face must have shown my dismay . What , retire before this sacred dog of a Wellington -- he who had listened unmoved to my words , and had sent me to his land of fogs ? I could have sobbed as I thought of it . 'What would you have ? ' cried Massena impatiently . 'When one is in check , it is necessary to move the king . ' 'Forwards , ' I suggested . He shook his grizzled head . 'The lines are not to be forced , ' said he . ' I have already lost General St. Croix and more men than I can replace . On the other hand , we have been here at Santarem for nearly six months . There is not a pound of flour nor a jug of wine on the countryside . We must retire . ' 'There are flour and wine in Lisbon , ' I persisted . 'Tut , you speak as if an army could charge in and charge out again like your regiment of hussars . If Soult were here with thirty thousand men -- but he will not come . I sent for you , however , Colonel Gerard , to say that I have a very singular and important expedition which I intend to place under your direction . ' I pricked up my ears , as you can imagine . The Marshal unrolled a great map of the country and spread it upon the table . He flattened it out with his little , hairy hands . 'This is Santarem , ' he said pointing . I nodded . 'And here , twenty-five miles to the east , is Almeixal , celebrated for its vintages and for its enormous Abbey . ' Again I nodded ; I could not think what was coming . 'Have you heard of the Marshal Millefleurs ? ' asked Massena . ' I have served with all the Marshals , ' said I , 'but there is none of that name . ' 'It is but the nickname which the soldiers have given him , ' said Massena . 'If you had not been away from us for some months , it would not be necessary for me to tell you about him . He is an Englishman , and a man of good breeding . It is on account of his manners that they have given him his title . I wish you to go to this polite Englishman at Almeixal . ' 'Yes , Marshal . ' 'And to hang him to the nearest tree . ' 'Certainly , Marshal . ' I turned briskly upon my heels , but Massena recalled me before I could reach the opening of his tent . 'One moment , Colonel , ' said he ; 'you had best learn how matters stand before you start . You must know , then , that this Marshal Millefleurs , whose real name is Alexis Morgan , is a man of very great ingenuity and bravery . He was an officer in the English Guards , but having been broken for cheating at cards , he left the army . In some manner he gathered a number of English deserters round him and took to the mountains . French stragglers and Portuguese brigands joined him , and he found himself at the head of five hundred men . With these he took possession of the Abbey of Almeixal , sent the monks about their business , fortified the place , and gathered in the plunder of all the country round . ' 'For which it is high time he was hanged , ' said I , making once more for the door . 'One instant ! ' cried the Marshal , smiling at my impatience . 'The worst remains behind . Only last week the Dowager Countess of La Ronda , the richest woman in Spain , was taken by these ruffians in the passes as she was journeying from King Joseph 's Court to visit her grandson . She is now a prisoner in the Abbey , and is only protected by her -- -- ' 'Grandmotherhood , ' I suggested . 'Her power of paying a ransom , ' said Massena . 'You have three missions , then : To rescue this unfortunate lady ; to punish this villain ; and , if possible , to break up this nest of brigands . It will be a proof of the confidence which I have in you when I say that I can only spare you half a squadron with which to accomplish all this . ' My word , I could hardly believe my ears ! I thought that I should have had my regiment at the least . ' I would give you more , ' said he , 'but I commence my retreat today , and Wellington is so strong in horse that every trooper becomes of importance . I can not spare you another man . You will see what you can do , and you will report yourself to me at Abrantes not later than tomorrow night . ' It was very complimentary that he should rate my powers so high , but it was also a little embarrassing . I was to rescue an old lady , to hang an Englishman , and to break up a band of five hundred assassins -- all with fifty men . But after all , the fifty men were Hussars of Conflans , and they had an Etienne Gerard to lead them . As I came out into the warm Portuguese sunshine my confidence had returned to me , and I had already begun to wonder whether the medal which I had so often deserved might not be waiting for me at Almeixal . You may be sure that I did not take my fifty men at hap-hazard . They were all old soldiers of the German wars , some of them with three stripes , and most of them with two . Oudet and Papilette , two of the best sub-officers in the regiment , were at their head . When I had them formed up in fours , all in silver grey and upon chestnut horses , with their leopard skin shabracks and their little red panaches , my heart beat high at the sight . I could not look at their weather-stained faces , with the great moustaches which bristled over their chin-straps , without feeling a glow of confidence , and , between ourselves , I have no doubt that that was exactly how they felt when they saw their young Colonel on his great black war-horse riding at their head . Well , when we got free of the camp and over the Tagus , I threw out my advance and my flankers , keeping my own place at the head of the main body . Looking back from the hills above Santarem , we could see the dark lines of Massena 's army , with the flash and twinkle of the sabres and bayonets as he moved his regiments into position for their retreat . To the south lay the scattered red patches of the English outposts , and behind the grey smoke-cloud which rose from Wellington 's camp -- thick , oily smoke , which seemed to our poor starving fellows to bear with it the rich smell of seething camp-kettles . Away to the west lay a curve of blue sea flecked with the white sails of the English ships . You will understand that as we were riding to the east , our road lay away from both armies . Our own marauders , however , and the scouting parties of the English , covered the country , and it was necessary with my small troop that I should take every precaution . During the whole day we rode over desolate hill-sides , the lower portions covered by the budding vines , but the upper turning from green to grey , and jagged along the skyline like the back of a starved horse . Mountain streams crossed our path , running west to the Tagus , and once we came to a deep , strong river , which might have checked us had I not found the ford by observing where houses had been built opposite each other upon either bank . Between them , as every scout should know , you will find your ford . There was none to give us information , for neither man nor beast , nor any living thing except great clouds of crows , was to be seen during our journey . The sun was beginning to sink when we came to a valley clear in the centre , but shrouded by huge oak trees upon either side . We could not be more than a few miles from Almeixal , so it seemed to me to be best to keep among the groves , for the spring had been an early one and the leaves were already thick enough to conceal us . We were riding then in open order among the great trunks , when one of my flankers came galloping up . 'There are English across the valley , Colonel , ' he cried , as he saluted . 'Cavalry or infantry ? ' 'Dragoons , Colonel , ' said he ; ' I saw the gleam of their helmets , and heard the neigh of a horse . ' Halting my men I hastened to the edge of the wood . There could be no doubt about it . A party of English cavalry was travelling in a line with us , and in the same direction . I caught a glimpse of their red coats and of their flashing arms glowing and twinkling among the tree-trunks . Once , as they passed through a small clearing , I could see their whole force , and I judged that they were of about the same strength as my own -- a half squadron at the most . You who have heard some of my little adventures will give me credit for being quick in my decisions , and prompt in carrying them out . But here I must confess that I was in two minds . On the one hand there was the chance of a fine cavalry skirmish with the English . On the other hand , there was my mission at the Abbey of Almeixal , which seemed already to be so much above my power . If I were to lose any of my men , it was certain that I should be unable to carry out my orders . I was sitting my horse , with my chin in my gauntlet , looking across at the rippling gleams of light from the further wood , when suddenly one of these red-coated Englishmen rode out from the cover , pointing at me and breaking into a shrill whoop and halloa as if I had been a fox . Three others joined him , and one who was a bugler sounded a call , which brought the whole of them into the open . They were , as I had thought , a half squadron , and they formed a double line with a front of twenty-five , their officer -- the one who had whooped at me -- at their head . For my own part , I had instantly brought my own troopers into the same formation , so that there we were , hussars and dragoons , with only two hundred yards of grassy sward between us . They carried themselves well , those red-coated troopers , with their silver helmets , their high white plumes , and their long , gleaming swords ; while , on the other hand , I am sure that they would acknowledge that they had never looked upon finer light horsemen than the fifty hussars of Conflans who were facing them . They were heavier , it is true , and they may have seemed the smarter , for Wellington used to make them burnish their metal work , which was not usual among us . On the other hand , it is well known that the English tunics were too tight for the sword-arm , which gave our men an advantage . As to bravery , foolish , inexperienced people of every nation always think that their own soldiers are braver than any others . There is no nation in the world which does not entertain this idea . But when one has seen as much as I have done , one understands that there is no very marked difference , and that although nations differ very much in discipline , they are all equally brave -- except that the French have rather more courage than the rest . Well , the cork was drawn and the glasses ready , when suddenly the English officer raised his sword to me as if in a challenge , and cantered his horse across the grassland . My word , there is no finer sight upon earth than that of a gallant man upon a gallant steed ! I could have halted there just to watch him as he came with such careless grace , his sabre down by his horse 's shoulder , his head thrown back , his white plume tossing -- youth and strength and courage , with the violet evening sky above and the oak trees behind . But it was not for me to stand and stare . Etienne Gerard may have his faults , but , my faith , he was never accused of being backward in taking his own part . The old horse , Rataplan , knew me so well that he had started off before ever I gave the first shake to the bridle . There are two things in this world that I am very slow to forget : the face of a pretty woman , and the legs of a fine horse . Well , as we drew together , I kept on saying , 'Where have I seen those great roan shoulders ? Where have I seen that dainty fetlock ? ' Then suddenly I remembered , and as I looked up at the reckless eyes and the challenging smile , whom should I recognize but the man who had saved me from the brigands and played me for my freedom -- he whose correct title was Milor the Hon . Sir Russell Bart ! 'Bart ! ' I shouted . He had his arm raised for a cut , and three parts of his body open to my point , for he did not know very much about the use of the sword . As I brought my hilt to the salute he dropped his hand and stared at me . 'Halloa ! ' said he . 'It 's Gerard ! ' You would have thought by his manner that I had met him by appointment . For my own part , I would have embraced him had he but come an inch of the way to meet me . ' I thought we were in for some sport , ' said he . ' I never dreamed that it was you . ' I found this tone of disappointment somewhat irritating . Instead of being glad at having met a friend , he was sorry at having missed an enemy . ' I should have been happy to join in your sport , my dear Bart , ' said I . 'But I really can not turn my sword upon a man who saved my life . ' 'Tut , never mind about that . ' 'No , it is impossible . I should never forgive myself . ' 'You make too much of a trifle . ' 'My mother 's one desire is to embrace you . If ever you should be in Gascony -- -- ' 'Lord Wellington is coming there with 60,000 men . ' 'Then one of them will have a chance of surviving , ' said I , laughing . 'In the meantime , put your sword in your sheath ! ' Our horses were standing head to tail , and the Bart put out his hand and patted me on the thigh . 'You 're a good chap , Gerard , ' said he . ' I only wish you had been born on the right side of the Channel . ' ' I was , ' said I . 'Poor devil ! ' he cried , with such an earnestness of pity that he set me laughing again . 'But look here , Gerard , ' he continued ; 'this is all very well , but it is not business , you know . I do n't know what Massena would say to it , but our Chief would jump out of his riding-boots if he saw us . We were n't sent out here for a picnic -- either of us . ' 'What would you have ? ' 'Well , we had a little argument about our hussars and dragoons , if you remember . I 've got fifty of the Sixteenth all chewing their carbine bullets behind me . You 've got as many fine-looking boys over yonder , who seem to be fidgeting in their saddles . If you and I took the right flanks we should not spoil each other 's beauty -- though a little blood-letting is a friendly thing in this climate . ' There seemed to me to be a good deal of sense in what he said . For the moment Mr Alexis Morgan and the Countess of La Ronda and the Abbey of Almeixal went right out of my head , and I could only think of the fine level turf and of the beautiful skirmish which we might have . 'Very good , Bart , ' said I . 'We have seen the front of your dragoons . We shall now have a look at their backs . ' 'Any betting ? ' he asked . 'The stake , ' said I , 'is nothing less than the honour of the Hussars of Conflans . ' 'Well , come on ! ' he answered . 'If we break you , well and good -- if you break us , it will be all the better for Marshal Millefleurs . ' When he said that I could only stare at him in astonishment . 'Why for Marshal Millefleurs ? ' I asked . 'It is the name of a rascal who lives out this way . My dragoons have been sent by Lord Wellington to see him safely hanged . ' 'Name of a name ! ' I cried . 'Why , my hussars have been sent by Massena for that very object . ' We burst out laughing at that , and sheathed our swords . There was a whirr of steel from behind us as our troopers followed our example . 'We are allies ! ' he cried . 'For a day . ' 'We must join forces . ' 'There is no doubt of it . ' And so , instead of fighting , we wheeled our half squadrons round and moved in two little columns down the valley , the shakos and the helmets turned inwards , and the men looking their neighbours up and down , like old fighting dogs with tattered ears who have learned to respect each other 's teeth . The most were on the broad grin , but there were some on either side who looked black and challenging , especially the English sergeant and my own sub-officer Papilette . They were men of habit , you see , who could not change all their ways of thinking in a moment . Besides , Papilette had lost his only brother at Busaco . As for the Bart and me , we rode together at the head and chatted about all that had occurred to us since that famous game of écarté of which I have told you . For my own part , I spoke to him of my adventures in England . They are a very singular people , these English . Although he knew that I had been engaged in twelve campaigns , yet I am sure that the Bart thought more highly of me because I had had an affair with the Bristol Bustler . He told me , too , that the Colonel who presided over his court-martial for playing cards with a prisoner acquitted him of neglect of duty , but nearly broke him because he thought that he had not cleared his trumps before leading his suit . Yes , indeed , they are a singular people . At the end of the valley the road curved over some rising ground before winding down into another wider valley beyond . We called a halt when we came to the top ; for there , right in front of us , at the distance of about three miles , was a scattered , grey town , with a single enormous building upon the flank of the mountain which overlooked it . We could not doubt that we were at last in sight of the Abbey that held the gang of rascals whom we had come to disperse . It was only now , I think , that we fully understood what a task lay in front of us , for the place was a veritable fortress , and it was evident that cavalry should never have been sent out upon such an errand . 'That 's got nothing to do with us , ' said the Bart ; Wellington and Massena can settle that between them . ' 'Courage ! ' I answered . 'Piré took Leipzig with fifty hussars . ' 'Had they been dragoons , ' said the Bart , laughing , 'he would have had Berlin . But you are senior officer ; give us a lead , and we 'll see who will be the first to flinch . ' 'Well , ' said I , 'whatever we do must be done at once , for my orders are to be on my way to Abrantes by tomorrow night . But we must have some information first , and here is someone who should be able to give it to us . ' There was a square , whitewashed house standing by the roadside , which appeared , from the bush hanging over the door , to be one of those wayside tabernas which are provided for the muleteers . A lantern was hung in the porch , and by its light we saw two men , the one in the brown habit of a Capuchin monk , and the other girt with an apron , which showed him to be the landlord . They were conversing together so earnestly that we were upon them before they were aware of us . The innkeeper turned to fly , but one of the Englishmen seized him by the hair , and held him tight . 'For mercy 's sake , spare me , ' he yelled . 'My house has been gutted by the French and harried by the English , and my feet have been burned by the brigands . I swear by the Virgin that I have neither money nor food in my inn , and the good Father Abbot , who is starving upon my doorstep , will be witness to it . ' 'Indeed , sir , ' said the Capuchin , in excellent French , 'what this worthy man says is very true . He is one of the many victims to these cruel wars , although his loss is but a feather-weight compared to mine . Let him go , ' he added , in English , to the trooper , 'he is too weak to fly , even if he desired to . ' In the light of the lantern I saw that this monk was a magnificent man , dark and bearded , with the eyes of a hawk , and so tall that his cowl came up to Rataplan 's ears . He wore the look of one who had been through much suffering , but he carried himself like a king , and we could form some opinion of his learning when we each heard him talk our own language as fluently as if he were born to it . 'You have nothing to fear , ' said I , to the trembling innkeeper . 'As to you , father , you are , if I am not mistaken , the very man who can give us the information which we require . ' 'All that I have is at your service , my son . But , ' he added , with a wan smile , 'my Lenten fare is always somewhat meagre , and this year it has been such that I must ask you for a crust of bread if I am to have the strength to answer your questions . ' We bore two days ' rations in our haversacks , so that he soon had the little he asked for . It was dreadful to see the wolfish way in which he seized the piece of dried goat 's flesh which I was able to offer him . 'Time presses , and we must come to the point , ' said I . 'We want your advice as to the weak points of yonder Abbey , and concerning the habits of the rascals who infest it . ' He cried out something which I took to be Latin , with his hands clasped and his eyes upturned . 'The prayer of the just availeth much , ' said he , 'and yet I had not dared to hope that mine would have been so speedily answered . In me you see the unfortunate Abbot of Almeixal , who has been cast out by this rabble of three armies with their heretical leader . Oh ! to think of what I have lost ! ' his voice broke , and the tears hung upon his lashes . 'Cheer up , sir , ' said the Bart . ' I 'll lay nine to four that we have you back again by tomorrow night . ' It is not of my own welfare that I think , ' said he , 'nor even of that of my poor , scattered flock . But it is of the holy relics which are left in the sacrilegious hands of these robbers . ' 'It 's even betting whether they would ever bother their heads about them , ' said the Bart . 'But show us the way inside the gates , and we'll soon clear the place out for you . ' In a few short words the good Abbot gave us the very points that we wished to know . But all that he said only made our task more formidable . The walls of the Abbey were forty feet high . The lower windows were barricaded , and the whole building loopholed for musketry fire . The gang preserved military discipline , and their sentries were too numerous for us to hope to take them by surprise . It was more than ever evident that a battalion of grenadiers and a couple of breaching pieces were what was needed . I raised my eyebrows , and the Bart began to whistle . 'We must have a shot at it , come what may , ' said he . The men had already dismounted , and , having watered their horses , were eating their suppers . For my own part I went into the sitting-room of the inn with the Abbot and the Bart , that we might talk about our plans . I had a little cognac in my _sauve vie_ , and I divided it among us -- just enough to wet our moustaches . 'It is unlikely , ' said I , 'that those rascals know anything about our coming . I have seen no signs of scouts along the road . My own plan is that we should conceal ourselves in some neighbouring wood , and then , when they open their gates , charge down upon them and take them by surprise . ' The Bart was of opinion that this was the best that we could do , but , when we came to talk it over , the Abbot made us see that there were difficulties in the way . 'Save on the side of the town , there is no place within a mile of the Abbey where you could shelter man or horse , ' said he . 'As to the townsfolk , they are not to be trusted . I fear , my son , that your excellent plan would have little chance of success in the face of the vigilant guard which these men keep . ' ' I see no other way , ' answered I . 'Hussars of Conflans are not so plentiful that I can afford to run half a squadron of them against a forty-foot wall with five hundred infantry behind it . ' ' I am a man of peace , ' said the Abbot , 'and yet I may , perhaps , give a word of counsel . I know these villains and their ways . Who should do so better , seeing that I have stayed for a month in this lonely spot , looking down in weariness of heart at the Abbey which was my own ? I will tell you now what I should myself do if I were in your place . ' 'Pray tell us , father , ' we cried , both together . 'You must know that bodies of deserters , both French and English , are continually coming in to them , carrying their weapons with them . Now , what is there to prevent you and your men from pretending to be such a body , and so making your way into the Abbey ? ' I was amazed at the simplicity of the thing , and I embraced the good Abbot . The Bart , however , had some objections to offer . 'That is all very well , ' said he , 'but if these fellows are as sharp as you say , it is not very likely that they are going to let a hundred armed strangers into their crib . From all I have heard of Mr Morgan , or Marshal Millefleurs , or whatever the rascal 's name is , I give him credit for more sense than that . ' 'Well , then , ' I cried , 'let us send fifty in , and let them at daybreak throw open the gates to the other fifty , who will be waiting outside . ' We discussed the question at great length and with much foresight and discretion . If it had been Massena and Wellington instead of two young officers of light cavalry , we could not have weighed it all with more judgment . At last we agreed , the Bart and I , that one of us should indeed go with fifty men , under pretence of being deserters , and that in the early morning he should gain command of the gate and admit the others . The Abbot , it is true , was still of opinion that it was dangerous to divide our force , but finding that we were both of the same mind , he shrugged his shoulders and gave in . 'There is only one thing that I would ask , ' said he . 'If you lay hands upon this Marshal Millefleurs -- this dog of a brigand -- what will you do with him ? ' 'Hang him , ' I answered . 'It is too easy a death , ' cried the Capuchin , with a vindictive glow in his dark eyes . 'Had I my way with him -- but , oh , what thoughts are these for a servant of God to harbour ! ' He clapped his hands to his forehead like one who is half demented by his troubles , and rushed out of the room . There was an important point which we had still to settle , and that was whether the French or the English party should have the honour of entering the Abbey first . My faith , it was asking a great deal of Etienne Gerard that he should give place to any man at such a time ! But the poor Bart pleaded so hard , urging the few skirmishes which he had seen against my four-and-seventy engagements , that at last I consented that he should go . We had just clasped hands over the matter when there broke out such a shouting and cursing and yelling from the front of the inn , that out we rushed with our drawn sabres in our hands , convinced that the brigands were upon us . You may imagine our feelings when , by the light of the lantern which hung from the porch , we saw a score of our hussars and dragoons all mixed in one wild heap , red coats and blue , helmets and busbies , pommelling each other to their hearts ' content . We flung ourselves upon them , imploring , threatening , tugging at a lace collar , or at a spurred heel , until , at last , we had dragged them all apart . There they stood , flushed and bleeding , glaring at each other , and all panting together like a line of troop horses after a ten-mile chase . It was only with our drawn swords that we could keep them from each other 's throats . The poor Capuchin stood in the porch in his long brown habit , wringing his hands and calling upon all the saints for mercy . He was , indeed , as I found upon inquiry , the innocent cause of all the turmoil , for , not understanding how soldiers look upon such things , he had made some remark to the English sergeant that it was a pity that his squadron was not as good as the French . The words were not out of his mouth before a dragoon knocked down the nearest hussar , and then , in a moment , they all flew at each other like tigers . We would trust them no more after that , but the Bart moved his men to the front of the inn , and I mine to the back , the English all scowling and silent , and our fellows shaking their fists and chattering , each after the fashion of their own people . Well , as our plans were made , we thought it best to carry them out at once , lest some fresh cause of quarrel should break out between our followers . The Bart and his men rode off , therefore , he having first torn the lace from his sleeves , and the gorget and sash from his uniform , so that he might pass as a simple trooper . He explained to his men what it was that was expected of them , and though they did not raise a cry or wave their weapons as mine might have done , there was an expression upon their stolid and clean-shaven faces which filled me with confidence . Their tunics were left unbuttoned , their scabbards and helmets stained with dirt , and their harness badly fastened , so that they might look the part of deserters , without order or discipline . At six o'clock next morning they were to gain command of the main gate of the Abbey , while at that same hour my hussars were to gallop up to it from outside . The Bart and I pledged our words to it before he trotted off with his detachment . My sergeant , Papilette , with two troopers , followed the English at a distance , and returned in half an hour to say that , after some parley , and the flashing of lanterns upon them from the grille , they had been admitted into the Abbey . So far , then , all had gone well . It was a cloudy night with a sprinkling of rain , which was in our favour , as there was the less chance of our presence being discovered . My vedettes I placed two hundred yards in every direction , to guard against a surprise , and also to prevent any peasant who might stumble upon us from carrying the news to the Abbey . Oudin and Papilette were to take turns of duty , while the others with their horses had snug quarters in a great wooden granary . Having walked round and seen that all was as it should be , I flung myself upon the bed which the innkeeper had set apart for me , and fell into a dreamless sleep . No doubt you have heard my name mentioned as being the beau-ideal of a soldier , and that not only by friends and admirers like our fellow-townsfolk , but also by old officers of the great wars who have shared the fortunes of those famous campaigns with me . Truth and modesty compel me to say , however , that this is not so . There are some gifts which I lack -- very few , no doubt -- but , still , amid the vast armies of the Emperor there may have been some who were free from those blemishes which stood between me and perfection . Of bravery I say nothing . Those who have seen me in the field are best fitted to speak about that . I have often heard the soldiers discussing round the camp-fires as to who was the bravest man in the Grand Army . Some said Murat , and some said Lasalle , and some Ney ; but for my own part , when they asked me , I merely shrugged my shoulders and smiled . It would have seemed mere conceit if I had answered that there was no man braver than Brigadier Gerard . At the same time , facts are facts , and a man knows best what his own feelings are . But there are other gifts besides bravery which are necessary for a soldier , and one of them is that he should be a light sleeper . Now , from my boyhood onwards , I have been hard to wake , and it was this which brought me to ruin upon that night . It may have been about two o'clock in the morning that I was suddenly conscious of a feeling of suffocation . I tried to call out , but there was something which prevented me from uttering a sound . I struggled to rise , but I could only flounder like a hamstrung horse . I was strapped at the ankles , strapped at the knees , and strapped again at the wrists . Only my eyes were free to move , and there at the foot of my couch , by the light of a Portuguese lamp , whom should I see but the Abbot and the innkeeper ! The latter 's heavy , white face had appeared to me when I looked upon it the evening before to express nothing but stupidity and terror . Now , on the contrary , every feature bespoke brutality and ferocity . Never have I seen a more dreadful-looking villain . In his hand he held a long , dull-coloured knife . The Abbot , on the other hand , was as polished and as dignified as ever . His Capuchin gown had been thrown open , however , and I saw beneath it a black , frogged coat , such as I have seen among the English officers . As our eyes met he leaned over the wooden end of the bed and laughed silently until it creaked again . 'You will , I am sure , excuse my mirth , my dear Colonel Gerard , ' said he . 'The fact is , that the expression upon your face when you grasped the situation was just a little funny . I have no doubt that you are an excellent soldier , but I hardly think that you are fit to measure wits with the Marshal Millefleurs , as your fellows have been good enough to call me . You appear to have given me credit for singularly little intelligence , which argues , if I may be allowed to say so , a want of acuteness upon your own part . Indeed , with the single exception of my thick-headed compatriot , the British dragoon , I have never met anyone who was less competent to carry out such a mission . ' You can imagine how I felt and how I looked , as I listened to this insolent harangue , which was all delivered in that flowery and condescending manner which had gained this rascal his nickname . I could say nothing , but they must have read my threat in my eyes , for the fellow who had played the part of the innkeeper whispered something to his companion . 'No , no , my dear Chenier , he will be infinitely more valuable alive , ' said he . 'By the way , Colonel , it is just as well that you are a sound sleeper , for my friend here , who is a little rough in his ways , would certainly have cut your throat if you had raised any alarm . I should recommend you to keep in his good graces , for Sergeant Chenier , late of the 7th Imperial Light Infantry , is a much more dangerous person than Captain Alexis Morgan , of His Majesty 's foot-guards . ' Chenier grinned and shook his knife at me , while I tried to look the loathing which I felt at the thought that a soldier of the Emperor could fall so low . 'It may amuse you to know , ' said the Marshal , in that soft , suave voice of his , 'that both your expeditions were watched from the time that you left your respective camps . I think that you will allow that Chenier and I played our parts with some subtlety . We had made every arrangement for your reception at the Abbey , though we had hoped to receive the whole squadron instead of half . When the gates are secured behind them , our visitors will find themselves in a very charming little mediaeval quadrangle , with no possible exit , commanded by musketry fire from a hundred windows . They may choose to be shot down ; or they may choose to surrender . Between ourselves , I have not the slightest doubt that they have been wise enough to do the latter . But since you are naturally interested in the matter , we thought that you would care to come with us and to see for yourself . I think I can promise you that you will find your titled friend waiting for you at the Abbey with a face as long as your own . ' The two villains began whispering together , debating , as far as I could hear , which was the best way of avoiding my vedettes . ' I will make sure that it is all clear upon the other side of the barn , ' said the Marshal at last . 'You will stay here , my good Chenier , and if the prisoner gives any trouble you will know what to do . ' So we were left together , this murderous renegade and I -- he sitting at the end of the bed , sharpening his knife upon his boot in the light of the single smoky little oil-lamp . As to me , I only wonder now , as I look back upon it , that I did not go mad with vexation and self-reproach as I lay helplessly upon the couch , unable to utter a word or move a finger , with the knowledge that my fifty gallant lads were so close to me , and yet with no means of letting them know the straits to which I was reduced . It was no new thing for me to be a prisoner ; but to be taken by these renegades , and to be led into their Abbey in the midst of their jeers , befooled and out-witted by their insolent leaders -- that was indeed more than I could endure . The knife of the butcher beside me would cut less deeply than that . I twitched softly at my wrists , and then at my ankles , but whichever of the two had secured me was no bungler at his work . I could not move either of them an inch . Then I tried to work the handkerchief down over my mouth , but the ruffian beside me raised his knife with such a threatening snarl that I had to desist . I was lying still looking at his bull neck , and wondering whether it would ever be my good fortune to fit it for a cravat , when I heard returning steps coming down the inn passage and up the stair . What word would the villain bring back ? If he found it impossible to kidnap me , he would probably murder me where I lay . For my own part , I was indifferent which it might be , and I looked at the doorway with the contempt and defiance which I longed to put into words . But you can imagine my feelings , my dear friends , when , instead of the tall figure and dark , sneering face of the Capuchin , my eyes fell upon the grey pelisse and huge moustaches of my good little sub-officer , Papilette ! The French soldier of those days had seen too much to be ever taken by surprise . His eyes had hardly rested upon my bound figure and the sinister face beside me before he had seen how the matter lay . 'Sacred name of a dog ! ' he growled , and out flashed his great sabre . Chenier sprang forward at him with his knife , and then , thinking better of it , he darted back and stabbed frantically at my heart . For my own part , I had hurled myself off the bed on the side opposite to him , and the blade grazed my side before ripping its way through blanket and sheet . An instant later I heard the thud of a heavy fall , and then almost simultaneously a second object struck the floor -- something lighter but harder , which rolled under the bed . I will not horrify you with details , my friends . Suffice it that Papilette was one of the strongest swordsmen in the regiment , and that his sabre was heavy and sharp . It left a red blotch upon my wrists and my ankles , as it cut the thongs which bound me . When I had thrown off my gag , the first use which I made of my lips was to kiss the sergeant 's scarred cheeks . The next was to ask him if all was well with the command . Yes , they had had no alarms . Oudin had just relieved him , and he had come to report . Had he seen the Abbot ? No , he had seen nothing of him . Then we must form a cordon and prevent his escape . I was hurrying out to give the orders , when I heard a slow and measured step enter the door below , and come creaking up the stairs . Papilette understood it all in an instant . 'You are not to kill him , ' I whispered , and thrust him into the shadow on one side of the door ; I crouched on the other . Up he came , up and up , and every footfall seemed to be upon my heart . The brown skirt of his gown was not over the threshold before we were both on him , like two wolves on a buck . Down we crashed , the three of us , he fighting like a tiger , and with such amazing strength that he might have broken away from the two of us . Thrice he got to his feet , and thrice we had him over again , until Papilette made him feel that there was a point to his sabre . He had sense enough then to know that the game was up , and to lie still while I lashed him with the very cords which had been round my own limbs . 'There has been a fresh deal , my fine fellow , ' said I , 'and you will find that I have some of the trumps in _my_ hand this time . ' 'Luck always comes to the aid of a fool , ' he answered . 'Perhaps it is as well , otherwise the world would fall too completely into the power of the astute . So , you have killed Chenier , I see . He was an insubordinate dog , and always smelt abominably of garlic . Might I trouble you to lay me upon the bed ? The floor of these Portuguese tabernas is hardly a fitting couch for anyone who has prejudices in favour of cleanliness . ' I could not but admire the coolness of the man , and the way in which he preserved the same insolent air of condescension in spite of this sudden turning of the tables . I dispatched Papilette to summon a guard , whilst I stood over our prisoner with my drawn sword , never taking my eyes off him for an instant , for I must confess that I had conceived a great respect for his audacity and resource . ' I trust , ' said he , 'that your men will treat me in a becoming manner . ' 'You will get your deserts -- you may depend upon that . ' ' I ask nothing more . You may not be aware of my exalted birth , but I am so placed that I can not name my father without treason , nor my mother without a scandal . I can not _claim_ Royal honours , but these things are so much more graceful when they are conceded without a claim . The thongs are cutting my skin . Might I beg you to loosen them ? ' 'You do not give me credit for much intelligence , ' I remarked , repeating his own words . '_Touché_ , ' he cried , like a pinked fencer . 'But here come your men , so it matters little whether you loosen them or not . ' I ordered the gown to be stripped from him and placed him under a strong guard . Then , as morning was already breaking , I had to consider what my next step was to be . The poor Bart and his Englishmen had fallen victims to the deep scheme which might , had we adopted all the crafty suggestions of our adviser , have ended in the capture of the whole instead of the half of our force . I must extricate them if it were still possible . Then there was the old lady , the Countess of La Ronda , to be thought of . As to the Abbey , since its garrison was on the alert it was hopeless to think of capturing that . All turned now upon the value which they placed upon their leader . The game depended upon my playing that one card . I will tell you how boldly and how skilfully I played it . It was hardly light before my bugler blew the assembly , and out we trotted on to the plain . My prisoner was placed on horseback in the very centre of the troops . It chanced that there was a large tree just out of musket-shot from the main gate of the Abbey , and under this we halted . Had they opened the great doors in order to attack us , I should have charged home upon them ; but , as I had expected , they stood upon the defensive , lining the long wall and pouring down a torrent of hootings and taunts and derisive laughter upon us . A few fired their muskets , but finding that we were out of reach they soon ceased to waste their powder . It was the strangest sight to see that mixture of uniforms , French , English , and Portuguese , cavalry , infantry , and artillery , all wagging their heads and shaking their fists at us . My word , their hubbub soon died away when we opened our ranks , and showed whom we had got in the midst of us ! There was silence for a few seconds , and then such a howl of rage and grief ! I could see some of them dancing like mad-men upon the wall . He must have been a singular person , this prisoner of ours , to have gained the affection of such a gang . I had brought a rope from the inn , and we slung it over the lower bough of the tree . 'You will permit me , monsieur , to undo your collar , ' said Papilette , with mock politeness . 'If your hands are perfectly clean , ' answered our prisoner , and set the whole half-squadron laughing . There was another yell from the wall , followed by a profound hush as the noose was tightened round Marshal Millefleurs ' neck . Then came a shriek from a bugle , the Abbey gates flew open , and three men rushed out waving white cloths in their hands . Ah , how my heart bounded with joy at the sight of them . And yet I would not advance an inch to meet them , so that all the eagerness might seem to be upon their side . I allowed my trumpeter , however , to wave a handkerchief in reply , upon which the three envoys came running towards us . The Marshal , still pinioned , and with the rope round his neck , sat his horse with a half smile , as one who is slightly bored and yet strives out of courtesy not to show it . If I were in such a situation I could not wish to carry myself better , and surely I can say no more than that . They were a singular trio , these ambassadors . The one was a Portuguese caçadore in his dark uniform , the second a French chasseur in the lightest green , and the third a big English artilleryman in blue and gold . They saluted , all three , and the Frenchman did the talking . 'We have thirty-seven English dragoons in our hands , ' said he . 'We give you our most solemn oath that they shall all hang from the Abbey wall within five minutes of the death of our Marshal . ' 'Thirty-seven ! ' I cried . 'You have fifty-one . ' 'Fourteen were cut down before they could be secured . ' 'And the officer ? ' 'He would not surrender his sword save with his life . It was not our fault . We would have saved him if we could . ' Alas for my poor Bart ! I had met him but twice , and yet he was a man very much after my heart . I have always had a regard for the English for the sake of that one friend . A braver man and a worse swordsman I have never met . I did not , as you may think , take these rascals ' word for anything . Papilette was dispatched with one of them , and returned to say that it was too true . I had now to think of the living . 'You will release the thirty-seven dragoons if I free your leader ? ' 'We will give you ten of them . ' 'Up with him ! ' I cried . 'Twenty , ' shouted the chasseur . 'No more words , ' said I . 'Pull on the rope ! ' 'All of them , ' cried the envoy , as the cord tightened round the Marshal 's neck . 'With horses and arms ? ' They could see that I was not a man to jest with . 'All complete , ' said the chasseur , sulkily . 'And the Countess of La Ronda as well ? ' said I . But here I met with firmer opposition . No threats of mine could induce them to give up the Countess . We tightened the cord . We moved the horse . We did all but leave the Marshal suspended . If once I broke his neck the dragoons were dead men . It was as precious to me as to them . 'Allow me to remark , ' said the Marshal , blandly , 'that you are exposing me to a risk of a quinsy . Do you not think , since there is a difference of opinion upon this point , that it would be an excellent idea to consult the lady herself ? We would neither of us , I am sure , wish to override her own inclinations . ' Nothing could be more satisfactory . You can imagine how quickly I grasped at so simple a solution . In ten minutes she was before us , a most stately dame , with her grey curls peeping out from under her mantilla . Her face was as yellow as though it reflected the countless doubloons of her treasury . 'This gentleman , ' said the Marshal , 'is exceedingly anxious to convey you to a place where you will never see us more . It is for you to decide whether you would wish to go with him , or whether you prefer to remain with me . ' She was at his horse 's side in an instant . 'My own Alexis , ' she cried , 'nothing can ever part us . ' He looked at me with a sneer upon his handsome face . 'By the way , you made a small slip of the tongue , my dear Colonel , ' said he . 'Except by courtesy , no such person exists as the Dowager Countess of La Ronda . The lady whom I have the honour to present to you is my very dear wife , Mrs Alexis Morgan -- or shall I say Madame la Marèchale Millefleurs ? ' It was at this moment that I came to the conclusion that I was dealing with the cleverest , and also the most unscrupulous , man whom I had ever met . As I looked upon this unfortunate old woman my soul was filled with wonder and disgust . As for her , her eyes were raised to his face with such a look as a young recruit might give to the Emperor . 'So be it , ' said I at last ; 'give me the dragoons and let me go . ' They were brought out with their horses and weapons , and the rope was taken from the Marshal 's neck . 'Good-bye , my dear Colonel , ' said he . ' I am afraid that you will have rather a lame account to give of your mission , when you find your way back to Massena , though , from all I hear , he will probably be too busy to think of you . I am free to confess that you have extricated yourself from your difficulties with greater ability than I had given you credit for . I presume that there is nothing which I can do for you before you go ? ' 'There is one thing . ' 'And that is ? ' 'To give fitting burial to this young officer and his men . ' ' I pledge my word to it . ' 'And there is one other . ' 'Name it . ' 'To give me five minutes in the open with a sword in your hand and a horse between your legs . ' 'Tut , tut ! ' said he . ' I should either have to cut short your promising career , or else to bid adieu to my own bonny bride . It is unreasonable to ask such a request of a man in the first joys of matrimony . ' I gathered my horsemen together and wheeled them into column . 'Au revoir , ' I cried , shaking my sword at him . 'The next time you may not escape so easily . ' 'Au revoir , ' he answered . 'When you are weary of the Emperor , you will always find a commission waiting for you in the service of the Marshal Millefleurs . ' 6 . HOW THE BRIGADIER PLAYED FOR A KINGDOM It has sometimes struck me that some of you , when you have heard me tell these little adventures of mine , may have gone away with the impression that I was conceited . There could not be a greater mistake than this , for I have always observed that really fine soldiers are free from this failing . It is true that I have had to depict myself sometimes as brave , sometimes as full of resource , always as interesting ; but , then , it really was so , and I had to take the facts as I found them . It would be an unworthy affectation if I were to pretend that my career has been anything but a fine one . The incident which I will tell you tonight , however , is one which you will understand that only a modest man would describe . After all , when one has attained such a position as mine , one can afford to speak of what an ordinary man might be tempted to conceal . You must know , then , that after the Russian campaign the remains of our poor army were quartered along the western bank of the Elbe , where they might thaw their frozen blood and try , with the help of the good German beer , to put a little between their skin and their bones . There were some things which we could not hope to regain , for I daresay that three large commissariat fourgons would not have sufficed to carry the fingers and the toes which the army had shed during that retreat . Still , lean and crippled as we were , we had much to be thankful for when we thought of our poor comrades whom we had left behind , and of the snowfields -- the horrible , horrible snowfields . To this day , my friends , I do not care to see red and white together . Even my red cap thrown down upon my white counterpane has given me dreams in which I have seen those monstrous plains , the reeling , tortured army , and the crimson smears which glared upon the snow behind them . You will coax no story out of me about that business , for the thought of it is enough to turn my wine to vinegar and my tobacco to straw . Of the half-million who crossed the Elbe in the autumn of the year '12 about forty thousand infantry were left in the spring of '13 . But they were terrible men , these forty thousand : men of iron , eaters of horses , and sleepers in the snow ; filled , too , with rage and bitterness against the Russians . They would hold the Elbe until the great army of conscripts , which the Emperor was raising in France , should be ready to help them to cross it once more . But the cavalry was in a deplorable condition . My own hussars were at Borna , and when I paraded them first , I burst into tears at the sight of them . My fine men and my beautiful horses -- it broke my heart to see the state to which they were reduced . 'But , courage , ' I thought , 'they have lost much , but their Colonel is still left to them . ' I set to work , therefore , to repair their disasters , and had already constructed two good squadrons , when an order came that all colonels of cavalry should repair instantly to the depôts of the regiments in France to organize the recruits and the remounts for the coming campaign . You will think , doubtless , that I was over-joyed at this chance of visiting home once more . I will not deny that it was a pleasure to me to know that I should see my mother again , and there were a few girls who would be very glad at the news ; but there were others in the army who had a stronger claim . I would have given my place to any who had wives and children whom they might not see again . However , there is no arguing when the blue paper with the little red seal arrives , so within an hour I was off upon my great ride from the Elbe to the Vosges . At last I was to have a period of quiet . War lay behind my mare 's tail and peace in front of her nostrils . So I thought , as the sound of the bugles died in the distance , and the long , white road curled away in front of me through plain and forest and mountain , with France somewhere beyond the blue haze which lay upon the horizon . It is interesting , but it is also fatiguing , to ride in the rear of an army . In the harvest time our soldiers could do without supplies , for they had been trained to pluck the grain in the fields as they passed , and to grind it for themselves in their bivouacs . It was at that time of year , therefore , that those swift marches were performed which were the wonder and the despair of Europe . But now the starving men had to be made robust once more , and I was forced to draw into the ditch continually as the Coburg sheep and the Bavarian bullocks came streaming past with waggon loads of Berlin beer and good French cognac . Sometimes , too , I would hear the dry rattle of the drums and the shrill whistle of the fifes , and long columns of our good little infantry men would swing past me with the white dust lying thick upon their blue tunics . These were old soldiers drawn from the garrisons of our German fortresses , for it was not until May that the new conscripts began to arrive from France . Well , I was rather tired of this eternal stopping and dodging , so that I was not sorry when I came to Altenburg to find that the road divided , and that I could take the southern and quieter branch . There were few wayfarers between there and Greiz , and the road wound through groves of oaks and beeches , which shot their branches across the path . You will think it strange that a Colonel of hussars should again and again pull up his horse in order to admire the beauty of the feathery branches and the little , green , new-budded leaves , but if you had spent six months among the fir trees of Russia you would be able to understand me . There was something , however , which pleased me very much less than the beauty of the forests , and that was the words and looks of the folk who lived in the woodland villages . We had always been excellent friends with the Germans , and during the last six years they had never seemed to bear us any malice for having made a little free with their country . We had shown kindnesses to the men and received them from the women , so that good , comfortable Germany was a second home to all of us . But now there was something which I could not understand in the behaviour of the people . The travellers made no answer to my salute ; the foresters turned their heads away to avoid seeing me ; and in the villages the folk would gather into knots in the roadway and would scowl at me as I passed . Even women would do this , and it was something new for me in those days to see anything but a smile in a woman 's eyes when they were turned upon me . It was in the hamlet of Schmolin , just ten miles out of Altenburg , that the thing became most marked . I had stopped at the little inn there just to damp my moustache and to wash the dust out of poor Violette 's throat . It was my way to give some little compliment , or possibly a kiss , to the maid who served me ; but this one would have neither the one nor the other , but darted a glance at me like a bayonet-thrust . Then when I raised my glass to the folk who drank their beer by the door they turned their backs on me , save only one fellow , who cried , 'Here 's a toast for you , boys ! Here 's to the letter T ! ' At that they all emptied their beer mugs and laughed ; but it was not a laugh that had good-fellowship in it . I was turning this over in my head and wondering what their boorish conduct could mean , when I saw , as I rode from the village , a great T new carved upon a tree . I had already seen more than one in my morning's ride , but I had given no thought to them until the words of the beer-drinker gave them an importance . It chanced that a respectable-looking person was riding past me at the moment , so I turned to him for information . 'Can you tell me , sir , ' said I , 'what this letter T is ? ' He looked at it and then at me in the most singular fashion . 'Young man , ' said he , 'it is not the letter N. ' Then before I could ask further he clapped his spurs into his horses ribs and rode , stomach to earth , upon his way . At first his words had no particular significance in my mind , but as I trotted onwards Violette chanced to half turn her dainty head , and my eyes were caught by the gleam of the brazen N 's at the end of the bridle-chain . It was the Emperor 's mark . And those T 's meant something which was opposite to it . Things had been happening in Germany , then , during our absence , and the giant sleeper had begun to stir . I thought of the mutinous faces that I had seen , and I felt that if I could only have looked into the hearts of these people I might have had some strange news to bring into France with me . It made me the more eager to get my remounts , and to see ten strong squadrons behind my kettle-drums once more . While these thoughts were passing through my head I had been alternately walking and trotting , as a man should who has a long journey before , and a willing horse beneath , him . The woods were very open at this point , and beside the road there lay a great heap of fagots . As I passed there came a sharp sound from among them , and , glancing round , I saw a face looking out at me -- a hot , red face , like that of a man who is beside himself with excitement and anxiety . A second glance told me that it was the very person with whom I had talked an hour before in the village . 'Come nearer ! ' he hissed . 'Nearer still ! Now dismount and pretend to be mending the stirrup leather . Spies may be watching us , and it means death to me if I am seen helping you . ' 'Death ! ' I whispered . 'From whom ? ' 'From the Tugendbund . From Lutzow 's night-riders . You Frenchmen are living on a powder magazine , and the match has been struck that will fire it . ' 'But this is all strange to me , ' said I , still fumbling at the leathers of my horse . 'What is this Tugendbund ? ' 'It is the secret society which has planned the great rising which is to drive you out of Germany , just as you have been driven out of Russia . ' 'And these T 's stand for it ? ' 'They are the signal . I should have told you all this in the village , but I dared not be seen speaking with you . I galloped through the woods to cut you off , and concealed both my horse and myself . ' ' I am very much indebted to you , ' said I , 'and the more so as you are the only German that I have met today from whom I have had common civility . ' 'All that I possess I have gained through contracting for the French armies , ' said he . 'Your Emperor has been a good friend to me . But I beg that you will ride on now , for we have talked long enough . Beware only of Lutzow 's night-riders ! ' 'Banditti ? ' I asked . 'All that is best in Germany , ' said he . 'But for God 's sake ride forwards , for I have risked my life and exposed my good name in order to carry you this warning . ' Well , if I had been heavy with thought before , you can think how I felt after my strange talk with the man among the fagots . What came home to me even more than his words was his shivering , broken voice , his twitching face , and his eyes glancing swiftly to right and left , and opening in horror whenever a branch cracked upon a tree . It was clear that he was in the last extremity of terror , and it is possible that he had cause , for shortly after I had left him I heard a distant gunshot and a shouting from somewhere behind me . It may have been some sportsman halloaing to his dogs , but I never again heard of or saw the man who had given me my warning . I kept a good look-out after this , riding swiftly where the country was open , and slowly where there might be an ambuscade . It was serious for me , since 500 good miles of German soil lay in front of me ; but somehow I did not take it very much to heart , for the Germans had always seemed to me to be a kindly , gentle people , whose hands closed more readily round a pipe-stem than a sword-hilt -- not out of want of valour , you understand , but because they are genial , open souls , who would rather be on good terms with all men . I did not know then that beneath that homely surface there lurks a devilry as fierce as , and far more persistent than , that of the Castilian or the Italian . And it was not long before I had shown to me that there was something more serious abroad than rough words and hard looks . I had come to a spot where the road runs upwards through a wild tract of heath-land and vanishes into an oak wood . I may have been half-way up the hill when , looking forward , I saw something gleaming under the shadow of the tree-trunks , and a man came out with a coat which was so slashed and spangled with gold that he blazed like a fire in the sunlight . He appeared to be very drunk , for he reeled and staggered as he came towards me . One of his hands was held up to his ear and clutched a great red handkerchief , which was fixed to his neck . I had reined up the mare and was looking at him with some disgust , for it seemed strange to me that one who wore so gorgeous a uniform should show himself in such a state in broad daylight . For his part , he looked hard in my direction and came slowly onwards , stopping from time to time and swaying about as he gazed at me . Suddenly , as I again advanced , he screamed out his thanks to Christ , and , lurching forwards , he fell with a crash upon the dusty road . His hands flew forward with the fall , and I saw that what I had taken for a red cloth was a monstrous wound , which had left a great gap in his neck , from which a dark blood-clot hung , like an epaulette upon his shoulder . 'My God ! ' I cried , as I sprang to his aid . 'And I thought that you were drunk ! ' 'Not drunk , but dying , ' said he . 'But thank Heaven that I have seen a French officer while I have still strength to speak . ' I laid him among the heather and poured some brandy down his throat . All round us was the vast countryside , green and peaceful , with nothing living in sight save only the mutilated man beside me . 'Who has done this ? ' I asked , 'and what are you ? You are French , and yet the uniform is strange to me . ' 'It is that of the Emperor 's new guard of honour . I am the Marquis of Château St Arnaud , and I am the ninth of my blood who has died in the service of France . I have been pursued and wounded by the night-riders of Lutzow , but I hid among the brushwood yonder , and waited in the hope that a Frenchman might pass . I could not be sure at first if you were friend or foe , but I felt that death was very near , and that I must take the chance . ' 'Keep your heart up , comrade , ' said I ; ' I have seen a man with a worse wound who has lived to boast of it . ' 'No , no , ' he whispered ; ' I am going fast . ' He laid his hand upon mine as he spoke , and I saw that his finger-nails were already blue . 'But I have papers here in my tunic which you must carry at once to the Prince of Saxe-Felstein , at his Castle of Hof . He is still true to us , but the Princess is our deadly enemy . She is striving to make him declare against us . If he does so , it will determine all those who are wavering , for the King of Prussia is his uncle and the King of Bavaria his cousin . These papers will hold him to us if they can only reach him before he takes the last step . Place them in his hands tonight , and , perhaps , you will have saved all Germany for the Emperor . Had my horse not been shot , I might , wounded as I am -- -- ' He choked , and the cold hand tightened into a grip , which left mine as bloodless as itself . Then , with a groan , his head jerked back , and it was all over with him . Here was a fine start for my journey home . I was left with a commission of which I knew little , which would lead me to delay the pressing needs of my hussars , and which at the same time was of such importance that it was impossible for me to avoid it . I opened the Marquis 's tunic , the brilliance of which had been devised by the Emperor in order to attract those young aristocrats from whom he hoped to raise these new regiments of his Guard . It was a small packet of papers which I drew out , tied up with silk , and addressed to the Prince of Saxe-Felstein . In the corner , in a sprawling , untidy hand , which I knew to be the Emperor 's own , was written : 'Pressing and most important . ' It was an order to me , those four words -- an order as clear as if it had come straight from the firm lips with the cold grey eyes looking into mine . My troopers might wait for their horses , the dead Marquis might lie where I had laid him amongst the heather , but if the mare and her rider had a breath left in them the papers should reach the Prince that night . I should not have feared to ride by the road through the wood , for I have learned in Spain that the safest time to pass through a guerilla country is after an outrage , and that the moment of danger is when all is peaceful . When I came to look upon my map , however , I saw that Hof lay further to the south of me , and that I might reach it more directly by keeping to the moors . Off I set , therefore , and had not gone fifty yards before two carbine shots rang out of the brushwood and a bullet hummed past me like a bee . It was clear that the night-riders were bolder in their ways than the brigands of Spain , and that my mission would have ended where it had begun if I had kept to the road . It was a mad ride , that -- a ride with a loose rein , girth-deep in heather and in gorse , plunging through bushes , flying down hill-sides , with my neck at the mercy of my dear little Violette . But she -- she never slipped , she never faltered , as swift and as surefooted as if she knew that her rider carried the fate of all Germany beneath the buttons of his pelisse . And I -- I had long borne the name of being the best horseman in the six brigades of light cavalry , but I never rode as I rode then . My friend the Bart had told me of how they hunt the fox in England , but the swiftest fox would have been captured by me that day . The wild pigeons which flew overhead did not take a straighter course than Violette and I below . As an officer , I have always been ready to sacrifice myself for my men , though the Emperor would not have thanked me for it , for he had many men , but only one -- well , cavalry leaders of the first class are rare . But here I had an object which was indeed worth a sacrifice , and I thought no more of my life than of the clods of earth that flew from my darling 's heels . We struck the road once more as the light was failing , and galloped into the little village of Lobenstein . But we had hardly got upon the cobblestones when off came one of the mare 's shoes , and I had to lead her to the village smithy . His fire was low , and his day 's work done , so that it would be an hour at the least before I could hope to push on to Hof . Cursing at the delay , I strode into the village inn and ordered a cold chicken and some wine to be served for my dinner . It was but a few miles to Hof , and I had every hope that I might deliver my papers to the Prince on that very night , and be on my way for France next morning with despatches for the Emperor in my bosom . I will tell you now what befell me in the inn of Lobenstein . The chicken had been served and the wine drawn , and I had turned upon both as a man may who has ridden such a ride , when I was aware of a murmur and a scuffling in the hall outside my door . At first I thought that it was some brawl between peasants in their cups , and I left them to settle their own affairs . But of a sudden there broke from among the low , sullen growl of the voices such a sound as would send Etienne Gerard leaping from his death-bed . It was the whimpering cry of a woman in pain . Down clattered my knife and my fork , and in an instant I was in the thick of the crowd which had gathered outside my door . The heavy-cheeked landlord was there and his flaxen-haired wife , the two men from the stables , a chambermaid , and two or three villagers . All of them , women and men , were flushed and angry , while there in the centre of them , with pale cheeks and terror in her eyes , stood the loveliest woman that ever a soldier would wish to look upon . With her queenly head thrown back , and a touch of defiance mingled with her fear , she looked as she gazed round her like a creature of a different race from the vile , coarse-featured crew who surrounded her . I had not taken two steps from my door before she sprang to meet me , her hand resting upon my arm and her blue eyes sparkling with joy and triumph . ' A French soldier and gentleman ! ' she cried . 'Now at last I am safe . ' 'Yes , madam , you are safe , ' said I , and I could not resist taking her hand in mine in order that I might reassure her . 'You have only to command me , ' I added , kissing the hand as a sign that I meant what I was saying . ' I am Polish , ' she cried ; 'the Countess Palotta is my name . They abuse me because I love the French . I do not know what they might have done to me had Heaven not sent you to my help . ' I kissed her hand again lest she should doubt my intentions . Then I turned upon the crew with such an expression as I know how to assume . In an instant the hall was empty . 'Countess , ' said I , 'you are now under my protection . You are faint , and a glass of wine is necessary to restore you . ' I offered her my arm and escorted her into my room , where she sat by my side at the table and took the refreshment which I offered her . How she blossomed out in my presence , this woman , like a flower before the sun ! She lit up the room with her beauty . She must have read my admiration in my eyes , and it seemed to me that I also could see something of the sort in her own . Ah ! my friends , I was no ordinary-looking man when I was in my thirtieth year . In the whole light cavalry it would have been hard to find a finer pair of whiskers . Murat 's may have been a shade longer , but the best judges are agreed that Murat 's were a shade too long . And then I had a manner . Some women are to be approached in one way and some in another , just as a siege is an affair of fascines and gabions in hard weather and of trenches in soft . But the man who can mix daring with timidity , who can be outrageous with an air of humility , and presumptuous with a tone of deference , that is the man whom mothers have to fear . For myself , I felt that I was the guardian of this lonely lady , and knowing what a dangerous man I had to deal with , I kept strict watch upon myself . Still , even a guardian has his privileges , and I did not neglect them . But her talk was as charming as her face . In a few words she explained that she was travelling to Poland , and that her brother who had been her escort had fallen ill upon the way . She had more than once met with ill-treatment from the country folk because she could not conceal her good-will towards the French . Then turning from her own affairs she questioned me about the army , and so came round to myself and my own exploits . They were familiar to her , she said , for she knew several of Poniatowski 's officers , and they had spoken of my doings . Yet she would be glad to hear them from my own lips . Never have I had so delightful a conversation . Most women make the mistake of talking rather too much about their own affairs , but this one listened to my tales just as you are listening now , ever asking for more and more and more . The hours slipped rapidly by , and it was with horror that I heard the village clock strike eleven , and so learned that for four hours I had forgotten the Emperor 's business . 'Pardon me , my dear lady , ' I cried , springing to my feet , 'but I must go on instantly to Hof . ' She rose also , and looked at me with a pale , reproachful face . 'And me ? ' she said . 'What is to become of me ? ' 'It is the Emperor 's affair . I have already stayed far too long . My duty calls me , and I must go . ' 'You must go ? And I must be abandoned alone to these savages ? Oh , why did I ever meet you ? Why did you ever teach me to rely upon your strength ? ' Her eyes glazed over , and in an instant she was sobbing upon my bosom . Here was a trying moment for a guardian ! Here was a time when he had to keep a watch upon a forward young officer . But I was equal to it . I smoothed her rich brown hair and whispered such consolations as I could think of in her ear , with one arm round her , it is true , but that was to hold her lest she should faint . She turned her tear-stained face to mine . 'Water , ' she whispered . 'For God 's sake , water ! ' I saw that in another moment she would be senseless . I laid the drooping head upon the sofa , and then rushed furiously from the room , hunting from chamber to chamber for a carafe . It was some minutes before I could get one and hurry back with it . You can imagine my feelings to find the room empty and the lady gone . Not only was she gone , but her cap and silver-mounted riding switch which had lain upon the table were gone also . I rushed out and roared for the landlord . He knew nothing of the matter , had never seen the woman before , and did not care if he never saw her again . Had the peasants at the door seen anyone ride away ? No , they had seen nobody . I searched here and searched there , until at last I chanced to find myself in front of a mirror , where I stood with my eyes staring and my jaw as far dropped as the chin-strap of my shako would allow . Four buttons of my pelisse were open , and it did not need me to put my hand up to know that my precious papers were gone . Oh ! the depth of cunning that lurks in a woman 's heart . She had robbed me , this creature , robbed me as she clung to my breast . Even while I smoothed her hair , and whispered kind words into her ear , her hands had been at work beneath my dolman . And here I was , at the very last step of my journey , without the power of carrying out this mission which had already deprived one good man of his life , and was likely to rob another one of his credit . What would the Emperor say when he heard that I had lost his despatches ? Would the army believe it of Etienne Gerard ? And when they heard that a woman 's hand had coaxed them from me , what laughter there would be at mess-table and at camp-fire ! I could have rolled upon the ground in my despair . But one thing was certain -- all this affair of the fracas in the hall and the persecution of the so-called Countess was a piece of acting from the beginning . This villainous innkeeper must be in the plot . From him I might learn who she was and where my papers had gone . I snatched my sabre from the table and rushed out in search of him . But the scoundrel had guessed what I would do , and had made his preparations for me . It was in the corner of the yard that I found him , a blunderbuss in his hands and a mastiff held upon a leash by his son . The two stable-hands , with pitchforks , stood upon either side , and the wife held a great lantern behind him , so as to guide his aim . 'Ride away , sir , ride away ! ' he cried , with a crackling voice . 'Your horse is at the door , and no one will meddle with you if you go your way ; but if you come against us , you are alone against three brave men . ' I had only the dog to fear , for the two forks and the blunderbuss were shaking about like branches in a wind . Still , I considered that , though I might force an answer with my sword-point at the throat of this fat rascal , still I should have no means of knowing whether that answer was the truth . It would be a struggle , then , with much to lose and nothing certain to gain . I looked them up and down , therefore , in a way that set their foolish weapons shaking worse than ever Produced by Jonathan Ingram , Garrett Alley , and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team .

HOW THE BRIGADIER CAME TO THE CASTLE OF GLOOM [ A ] You do very well , my friends , to treat me with some little reverence , for in honouring me you are honouring both France and yourselves . It is not merely an old , grey-moustached officer whom you see eating his omelette or draining his glass , but it is a fragment of history . In me you see one of the last of those wonderful men , the men who were veterans when they were yet boys , who learned to use a sword earlier than a razor , and who during a hundred battles had never once let the enemy see the colour of their knapsacks . For twenty years we were teaching Europe how to fight , and even when they had learned their lesson it was only the thermometer , and never the bayonet , which could break the Grand Army down . Berlin , Naples , Vienna , Madrid , Lisbon , Moscow -- we stabled our horses in them all . Yes , my friends , I say again that you do well to send your children to me with flowers , for these ears have heard the trumpet calls of France , and these eyes have seen her standards in lands where they may never be seen again . Even now , when I doze in my arm-chair , I can see those great warriors stream before me -- the green-jacketed chasseurs , the giant cuirassiers , Poniatowsky 's lancers , the white-mantled dragoons , the nodding bearskins of the horse grenadiers . And then there comes the thick , low rattle of the drums , and through wreaths of dust and smoke I see the line of high bonnets , the row of brown faces , the swing and toss of the long , red plumes amid the sloping lines of steel . And there rides Ney with his red head , and Lefebvre with his bulldog jaw , and Lannes with his Gascon swagger ; and then amidst the gleam of brass and the flaunting feathers I catch a glimpse of _him_ , the man with the pale smile , the rounded shoulders , and the far-off eyes . There is an end of my sleep , my friends , for up I spring from my chair , with a cracked voice calling and a silly hand outstretched , so that Madame Titaux has one more laugh at the old fellow who lives among the shadows . Although I was a full Chief of Brigade when the wars came to an end , and had every hope of soon being made a General of Division , it is still rather to my earlier days that I turn when I wish to talk of the glories and the trials of a soldier 's life . For you will understand that when an officer has so many men and horses under him , he has his mind full of recruits and remounts , fodder and farriers , and quarters , so that even when he is not in the face of the enemy , life is a very serious matter for him . But when he is only a lieutenant or a captain he has nothing heavier than his epaulettes upon his shoulders , so that he can clink his spurs and swing his dolman , drain his glass and kiss his girl , thinking of nothing save of enjoying a gallant life . That is the time when he is likely to have adventures , and it is often to that time that I shall turn in the stories which I may have for you . So it will be tonight when I tell you of my visit to the Castle of Gloom ; of the strange mission of Sub-Lieutenant Duroc , and of the horrible affair of the man who was once known as Jean Carabin , and afterwards as the Baron Straubenthal . You must know , then , that in the February of 1807 , immediately after the taking of Danzig , Major Legendre and I were commissioned to bring four hundred remounts from Prussia into Eastern Poland . The hard weather , and especially the great battle at Eylau , had killed so many of the horses that there was some danger of our beautiful Tenth of Hussars becoming a battalion of light infantry . We knew , therefore , both the Major and I , that we should be very welcome at the front . We did not advance very rapidly , however , for the snow was deep , the roads detestable , and we had but twenty returning invalids to assist us . Besides , it is impossible , when you have a daily change of forage , and sometimes none at all , to move horses faster than a walk . I am aware that in the story-books the cavalry whirls past at the maddest of gallops ; but for my own part , after twelve campaigns , I should be very satisfied to know that my brigade could always walk upon the march and trot in the presence of the enemy . This I say of the hussars and chasseurs , mark you , so that it is far more the case with cuirassiers or dragoons . For myself I am fond of horses , and to have four hundred of them , of every age and shade and character , all under my own hands , was a very great pleasure to me . They were from Pomerania for the most part , though some were from Normandy and some from Alsace , and it amused us to notice that they differed in character as much as the people of those provinces . We observed also , what I have often proved since , that the nature of a horse can be told by his colour , from the coquettish light bay , full of fancies and nerves , to the hardy chestnut , and from the docile roan to the pig-headed rusty-black . All this has nothing in the world to do with my story , but how is an officer of cavalry to get on with his tale when he finds four hundred horses waiting for him at the outset ? It is my habit , you see , to talk of that which interests myself and so I hope that I may interest you . We crossed the Vistula opposite Marienwerder , and had got as far as Riesenberg , when Major Legendre came into my room in the post-house with an open paper in his hand . 'You are to leave me , ' said he , with despair upon his face . It was no very great grief to me to do that , for he was , if I may say so , hardly worthy to have such a subaltern . I saluted , however , in silence . 'It is an order from General Lasalle , ' he continued ; 'you are to proceed to Rossel instantly , and to report yourself at the headquarters of the regiment . ' No message could have pleased me better . I was already very well thought of by my superior officers . It was evident to me , therefore , that this sudden order meant that the regiment was about to see service once more , and that Lasalle understood how incomplete my squadron would be without me . It is true that it came at an inconvenient moment , for the keeper of the post-house had a daughter -- one of those ivory-skinned , black-haired Polish girls -- with whom I had hoped to have some further talk . Still , it is not for the pawn to argue when the fingers of the player move him from the square ; so down I went , saddled my big black charger , Rataplan , and set off instantly upon my lonely journey . My word , it was a treat for those poor Poles and Jews , who have so little to brighten their dull lives , to see such a picture as that before their doors ! The frosty morning air made Rataplan 's great black limbs and the beautiful curves of his back and sides gleam and shimmer with every gambade . As for me , the rattle of hoofs upon a road , and the jingle of bridle chains which comes with every toss of a saucy head , would even now set my blood dancing through my veins . You may think , then , how I carried myself in my five-and-twentieth year -- I , Etienne Gerard , the picked horseman and surest blade in the ten regiments of hussars . Blue was our colour in the Tenth -- a sky-blue dolman and pelisse with a scarlet front -- and it was said of us in the army that we could set a whole population running , the women towards us , and the men away . There were bright eyes in the Riesenberg windows that morning which seemed to beg me to tarry ; but what can a soldier do , save to kiss his hand and shake his bridle as he rides upon his way ? It was a bleak season to ride through the poorest and ugliest country in Europe , but there was a cloudless sky above , and a bright , cold sun , which shimmered on the huge snowfields . My breath reeked into the frosty air , and Rataplan sent up two feathers of steam from his nostrils , while the icicles drooped from the side-irons of his bit . I let him trot to warm his limbs , while for my own part I had too much to think of to give much heed to the cold . To north and south stretched the great plains , mottled over with dark clumps of fir and lighter patches of larch . A few cottages peeped out here and there , but it was only three months since the Grand Army had passed that way , and you know what that meant to a country . The Poles were our friends , it was true , but out of a hundred thousand men , only the Guard had waggons , and the rest had to live as best they might . It did not surprise me , therefore , to see no signs of cattle and no smoke from the silent houses . A weal had been left across the country where the great host had passed , and it was said that even the rats were starved wherever the Emperor had led his men . By midday I had got as far as the village of Saalfeldt , but as I was on the direct road for Osterode , where the Emperor was wintering , and also for the main camp of the seven divisions of infantry , the highway was choked with carriages and carts . What with artillery caissons and waggons and couriers , and the ever-thickening stream of recruits and stragglers , it seemed to me that it would be a very long time before I should join my comrades . The plains , however , were five feet deep in snow , so there was nothing for it but to plod upon our way . It was with joy , therefore , that I found a second road which branched away from the other , trending through a fir-wood towards the north . There was a small auberge at the cross-roads , and a patrol of the Third Hussars of Conflans -- the very regiment of which I was afterwards colonel -- were mounting their horses at the door . On the steps stood their officer , a slight , pale young man , who looked more like a young priest from a seminary than a leader of the devil-may-care rascals before him . 'Good-day , sir , ' said he , seeing that I pulled up my horse . 'Good-day , ' I answered . ' I am Lieutenant Etienne Gerard , of the Tenth . ' I could see by his face that he had heard of me . Everybody had heard of me since my duel with the six fencing masters . My manner , however , served to put him at his ease with me . ' I am Sub-Lieutenant Duroc , of the Third , ' said he . 'Newly joined ? ' I asked . 'Last week . ' I had thought as much , from his white face and from the way in which he let his men lounge upon their horses . It was not so long , however , since I had learned myself what it was like when a schoolboy has to give orders to veteran troopers . It made me blush , I remember , to shout abrupt commands to men who had seen more battles than I had years , and it would have come more natural for me to say , 'With your permission , we shall now wheel into line , ' or , 'If you think it best , we shall trot . ' I did not think the less of the lad , therefore , when I observed that his men were somewhat out of hand , but I gave them a glance which stiffened them in their saddles . 'May I ask , monsieur , whether you are going by this northern road ? ' I asked . 'My orders are to patrol it as far as Arensdorf , ' said he . 'Then I will , with your permission , ride so far with you , ' said I . 'It is very clear that the longer way will be the faster . ' So it proved , for this road led away from the army into a country which was given over to Cossacks and marauders , and it was as bare as the other was crowded . Duroc and I rode in front , with our six troopers clattering in the rear . He was a good boy , this Duroc , with his head full of the nonsense that they teach at St Cyr , knowing more about Alexander and Pompey than how to mix a horse 's fodder or care for a horse 's feet . Still , he was , as I have said , a good boy , unspoiled as yet by the camp . It pleased me to hear him prattle away about his sister Marie and about his mother in Amiens . Presently we found ourselves at the village of Hayenau . Duroc rode up to the post-house and asked to see the master . 'Can you tell me , ' said he , 'whether the man who calls himself the Baron Straubenthal lives in these parts ? ' The postmaster shook his head , and we rode upon our way . I took no notice of this , but when , at the next village , my comrade repeated the same question , with the same result , I could not help asking him who this Baron Straubenthal might be . 'He is a man , ' said Duroc , with a sudden flush upon his boyish face , 'to whom I have a very important message to convey . ' Well , this was not satisfactory , but there was something in my companion 's manner which told me that any further questioning would be distasteful to him . I said nothing more , therefore , but Duroc would still ask every peasant whom we met whether he could give him any news of the Baron Straubenthal . For my own part I was endeavouring , as an officer of light cavalry should , to form an idea of the lay of the country , to note the course of the streams , and to mark the places where there should be fords . Every step was taking us farther from the camp round the flanks of which we were travelling . Far to the south a few plumes of grey smoke in the frosty air marked the position of some of our outposts . To the north , however , there was nothing between ourselves and the Russian winter quarters . Twice on the extreme horizon I caught a glimpse of the glitter of steel , and pointed it out to my companion . It was too distant for us to tell whence it came , but we had little doubt that it was from the lance-heads of marauding Cossacks . The sun was just setting when we rode over a low hill and saw a small village upon our right , and on our left a high black castle , which jutted out from amongst the pine-woods . A farmer with his cart was approaching us -- a matted-haired , downcast fellow , in a sheepskin jacket . 'What village is this ? ' asked Duroc . 'It is Arensdorf , ' he answered , in his barbarous German dialect . 'Then here I am to stay the night , ' said my young companion . Then , turning to the farmer , he asked his eternal question , 'Can you tell me where the Baron Straubenthal lives ? ' 'Why , it is he who owns the Castle of Gloom , ' said the farmer , pointing to the dark turrets over the distant fir forest . Duroc gave a shout like the sportsman who sees his game rising in front of him . The lad seemed to have gone off his head -- his eyes shining , his face deathly white , and such a grim set about his mouth as made the farmer shrink away from him . I can see him now , leaning forward on his brown horse , with his eager gaze fixed upon the great black tower . 'Why do you call it the Castle of Gloom ? ' I asked . 'Well , it 's the name it bears upon the countryside , ' said the farmer . 'By all accounts there have been some black doings up yonder . It 's not for nothing that the wickedest man in Poland has been living there these fourteen years past . ' ' A Polish nobleman ? ' I asked . 'Nay , we breed no such men in Poland , ' he answered . ' A Frenchman , then ? ' cried Duroc . 'They say that he came from France . ' 'And with red hair ? ' 'As red as a fox . ' 'Yes , yes , it is my man , ' cried my companion , quivering all over in his excitement . 'It is the hand of Providence which has led me here . Who can say that there is not justice in this world ? Come , Monsieur Gerard , for I must see the men safely quartered before I can attend to this private matter . ' He spurred on his horse , and ten minutes later we were at the door of the inn of Arensdorf , where his men were to find their quarters for the night . Well , all this was no affair of mine , and I could not imagine what the meaning of it might be . Rossel was still far off , but I determined to ride on for a few hours and take my chance of some wayside barn in which I could find shelter for Rataplan and myself . I had mounted my horse , therefore , after tossing off a cup of wine , when young Duroc came running out of the door and laid his hand upon my knee . 'Monsieur Gerard , ' he panted , ' I beg of you not to abandon me like this ! ' 'My good sir , ' said I , 'if you would tell me what is the matter and what you would wish me to do , I should be better able to tell you if I could be of any assistance to you . ' 'You can be of the very greatest , ' he cried . 'Indeed , from all that I have heard of you , Monsieur Gerard , you are the one man whom I should wish to have by my side tonight . ' 'You forget that I am riding to join my regiment . ' 'You can not , in any case , reach it tonight . Tomorrow will bring you to Rossel . By staying with me you will confer the very greatest kindness upon me , and you will aid me in a matter which concerns my own honour and the honour of my family . I am compelled , however , to confess to you that some personal danger may possibly be involved . ' It was a crafty thing for him to say . Of course , I sprang from Rataplan 's back and ordered the groom to lead him back into the stables . 'Come into the inn , ' said I , 'and let me know exactly what it is that you wish me to do . ' He led the way into a sitting-room , and fastened the door lest we should be interrupted . He was a well-grown lad , and as he stood in the glare of the lamp , with the light beating upon his earnest face and upon his uniform of silver grey , which suited him to a marvel , I felt my heart warm towards him . Without going so far as to say that he carried himself as I had done at his age , there was at least similarity enough to make me feel in sympathy with him . ' I can explain it all in a few words , ' said he . 'If I have not already satisfied your very natural curiosity , it is because the subject is so painful a one to me that I can hardly bring myself to allude to it . I can not , however , ask for your assistance without explaining to you exactly how the matter lies . 'You must know , then , that my father was the well-known banker , Christophe Duroc , who was murdered by the people during the September massacres . As you are aware , the mob took possession of the prisons , chose three so-called judges to pass sentence upon the unhappy aristocrats , and then tore them to pieces when they were passed out into the street . My father had been a benefactor of the poor all his life . There were many to plead for him . He had the fever , too , and was carried in , half-dead , upon a blanket . Two of the judges were in favour of acquitting him ; the third , a young Jacobin , whose huge body and brutal mind had made him a leader among these wretches , dragged him , with his own hands , from the litter , kicked him again and again with his heavy boots , and hurled him out of the door , where in an instant he was torn limb from limb under circumstances which are too horrible for me to describe . This , as you perceive , was murder , even under their own unlawful laws , for two of their own judges had pronounced in my father's favour . 'Well , when the days of order came back again , my elder brother began to make inquiries about this man . I was only a child then , but it was a family matter , and it was discussed in my presence . The fellow 's name was Carabin . He was one of Sansterre 's Guard , and a noted duellist . A foreign lady named the Baroness Straubenthal having been dragged before the Jacobins , he had gained her liberty for her on the promise that she with her money and estates should be his . He had married her , taken her name and title , and escaped out of France at the time of the fall of Robespierre . What had become of him we had no means of learning . 'You will think , doubtless , that it would be easy for us to find him , since we had both his name and his title . You must remember , however , that the Revolution left us without money , and that without money such a search is very difficult . Then came the Empire , and it became more difficult still , for , as you are aware , the Emperor considered that the 18th Brumaire brought all accounts to a settlement , and that on that day a veil had been drawn across the past . None the less , we kept our own family story and our own family plans . 'My brother joined the army , and passed with it through all Southern Europe , asking everywhere for the Baron Straubenthal . Last October he was killed at Jena , with his mission still unfulfilled . Then it became my turn , and I have the good fortune to hear of the very man of whom I am in search at one of the first Polish villages which I have to visit , and within a fortnight of joining my regiment . And then , to make the matter even better , I find myself in the company of one whose name is never mentioned throughout the army save in connection with some daring and generous deed . ' This was all very well , and I listened to it with the greatest interest , but I was none the clearer as to what young Duroc wished me to do . 'How can I be of service to you ? ' I asked . 'By coming up with me . ' 'To the Castle ? ' 'Precisely . ' 'When ? ' 'At once . ' 'But what do you intend to do ? ' ' I shall know what to do . But I wish you to be with me , all the same . ' Well , it was never in my nature to refuse an adventure , and , besides , I had every sympathy with the lad 's feelings . It is very well to forgive one 's enemies , but one wishes to give them something to forgive also . I held out my hand to him , therefore . ' I must be on my way for Rossel tomorrow morning , but tonight I am yours , ' said I . We left our troopers in snug quarters , and , as it was but a mile to the Castle , we did not disturb our horses . To tell the truth , I hate to see a cavalry man walk , and I hold that just as he is the most gallant thing upon earth when he has his saddle-flaps between his knees , so he is the most clumsy when he has to loop up his sabre and his sabre-tasche in one hand and turn in his toes for fear of catching the rowels of his spurs . Still , Duroc and I were of the age when one can carry things off , and I dare swear that no woman at least would have quarrelled with the appearance of the two young hussars , one in blue and one in grey , who set out that night from the Arensdorf post-house . We both carried our swords , and for my own part I slipped a pistol from my holster into the inside of my pelisse , for it seemed to me that there might be some wild work before us . The track which led to the Castle wound through a pitch-black fir-wood , where we could see nothing save the ragged patch of stars above our heads . Presently , however , it opened up , and there was the Castle right in front of us , about as far as a carbine would carry . It was a huge , uncouth place , and bore every mark of being exceedingly old , with turrets at every corner , and a square keep on the side which was nearest to us . In all its great shadow there was no sign of light save from a single window , and no sound came from it . To me there was something awful in its size and its silence , which corresponded so well with its sinister",The Exploits Of Brigadier Gerard
Charles Darwin,"could Nature , but far more easily , from having incomparably longer time at her disposal . Nor do I believe that any great physical change , as of climate , or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration , is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants . For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces , extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others ; and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage . No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live , that none of them could anyhow be improved ; for in all countries , the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions , that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land . And as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives , we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage , so as to have better resisted such intruders . As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection , what may not nature effect ? Man can act only on external and visible characters : nature cares nothing for appearances , except in so far as they may be useful to any being . She can act on every internal organ , on every shade of constitutional difference , on the whole machinery of life . Man selects only for his own good ; Nature only for that of the being which she tends . Every selected character is fully exercised by her ; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life . Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country ; he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner ; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food ; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner ; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate . He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females . He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals , but protects during each varying season , as far as lies in his power , all his productions . He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form ; or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye , or to be plainly useful to him . Under nature , the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life , and so be preserved . How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man ! how short his time ! and consequently how poor will his products be , compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods . Can we wonder , then , that nature ’ s productions should be far “ truer ” in character than man ’ s productions ; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life , and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship ? It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising , throughout the world , every variation , even the slightest ; rejecting that which is bad , preserving and adding up all that is good ; silently and insensibly working , whenever and wherever opportunity offers , at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life . We see nothing of these slow changes in progress , until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages , and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages , that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were . Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being , yet characters and structures , which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance , may thus be acted on . When we see leaf-eating insects green , and bark-feeders mottled-grey ; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter , the red-grouse the colour of heather , and the black-grouse that of peaty earth , we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger . Grouse , if not destroyed at some period of their lives , would increase in countless numbers ; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey ; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey , —so much so , that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons , as being the most liable to destruction . Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse , and in keeping that colour , when once acquired , true and constant . Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect : we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black . In plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance : yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist , Downing , that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle , a curculio , than those with down ; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums ; whereas another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh . If , with all the aids of art , these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties , assuredly , in a state of nature , where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies , such differences would effectually settle which variety , whether a smooth or downy , a yellow or purple fleshed fruit , should succeed . In looking at many small points of difference between species , which , as far as our ignorance permits us to judge , seem to be quite unimportant , we must not forget that climate , food , etc. , probably produce some slight and direct effect . It is , however , far more necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth , which , when one part of the organisation is modified through variation , and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the being , will cause other modifications , often of the most unexpected nature . As we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any particular period of life , tend to reappear in the offspring at the same period ; —for instance , in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants ; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm ; in the eggs of poultry , and in the colour of the down of their chickens ; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult ; —so in a state of nature , natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age , by the accumulation of profitable variations at that age , and by their inheritance at a corresponding age . If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind , I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection , than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees . Natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies , wholly different from those which concern the mature insect . These modifications will no doubt affect , through the laws of correlation , the structure of the adult ; and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours , and which never feed , a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvæ . So , conversely , modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva ; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life , shall not be in the least degree injurious : for if they became so , they would cause the extinction of the species . Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent , and of the parent in relation to the young . In social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community ; if each in consequence profits by the selected change . What natural selection can not do , is to modify the structure of one species , without giving it any advantage , for the good of another species ; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history , I can not find one case which will bear investigation . A structure used only once in an animal ’ s whole life , if of high importance to it , might be modified to any extent by natural selection ; for instance , the great jaws possessed by certain insects , and used exclusively for opening the cocoon—or the hard tip to the beak of nestling birds , used for breaking the egg . It has been asserted , that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it ; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching . Now , if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird ’ s own advantage , the process of modification would be very slow , and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds within the egg , which had the most powerful and hardest beaks , for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish : or , more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected , the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure . _Sexual Selection_.—Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex , the same fact probably occurs under nature , and if so , natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex , or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes , as is sometimes the case with insects . And this leads me to say a few words on what I call Sexual Selection . This depends , not on a struggle for existence , but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females ; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor , but few or no offspring . Sexual selection is , therefore , less rigorous than natural selection . Generally , the most vigorous males , those which are best fitted for their places in nature , will leave most progeny . But in many cases , victory will depend not on general vigour , but on having special weapons , confined to the male sex . A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring . Sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage , length to the spur , and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg , as well as the brutal cock-fighter , who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks . How low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends , I know not ; male alligators have been described as fighting , bellowing , and whirling round , like Indians in a war-dance , for the possession of the females ; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long ; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males . The war is , perhaps , severest between the males of polygamous animals , and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons . The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed ; though to them and to others , special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection , as the mane to the lion , the shoulder-pad to the boar , and the hooked jaw to the male salmon ; for the shield may be as important for victory , as the sword or spear . Amongst birds , the contest is often of a more peaceful character . All those who have attended to the subject , believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females . The rock-thrush of Guiana , birds of Paradise , and some others , congregate ; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females , which standing by as spectators , at last choose the most attractive partner . Those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes : thus Sir R. Heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds . It may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means : I can not here enter on the details necessary to support this view ; but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams , according to his standard of beauty , I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds , by selecting , during thousands of generations , the most melodious or beautiful males , according to their standard of beauty , might produce a marked effect . I strongly suspect that some well-known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds , in comparison with the plumage of the young , can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection , acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season ; the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons , either by the males alone , or by the males and females ; but I have not space here to enter on this subject . Thus it is , as I believe , that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life , but differ in structure , colour , or ornament , such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection ; that is , individual males have had , in successive generations , some slight advantage over other males , in their weapons , means of defence , or charms ; and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring . Yet , I would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency : for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals ( as the wattle in male carriers , horn-like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls , etc . ) , which we can not believe to be either useful to the males in battle , or attractive to the females . We see analogous cases under nature , for instance , the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock , which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird ; —indeed , had the tuft appeared under domestication , it would have been called a monstrosity . _Illustrations of the action of Natural Selection_.—In order to make it clear how , as I believe , natural selection acts , I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations . Let us take the case of a wolf , which preys on various animals , securing some by craft , some by strength , and some by fleetness ; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey , a deer for instance , had from any change in the country increased in numbers , or that other prey had decreased in numbers , during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food . I can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving , and so be preserved or selected , —provided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year , when they might be compelled to prey on other animals . I can see no more reason to doubt this , than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection , or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed . Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed , a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey . Nor can this be thought very improbable ; for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals ; one cat , for instance , taking to catch rats , another mice ; one cat , according to Mr. St. John , bringing home winged game , another hares or rabbits , and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes . The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited . Now , if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf , it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring . Some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure , and by the repetition of this process , a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf . Or , again , the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district , and those frequenting the lowlands , would naturally be forced to hunt different prey ; and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites , two varieties might slowly be formed . These varieties would cross and blend where they met ; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return . I may add , that , according to Mr. Pierce , there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United States , one with a light greyhound-like form , which pursues deer , and the other more bulky , with shorter legs , which more frequently attacks the shepherd ’ s flocks . Let us now take a more complex case . Certain plants excrete a sweet juice , apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap : this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminosæ , and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel . This juice , though small in quantity , is greedily sought by insects . Let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower . In this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen , and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower . The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed ; and the act of crossing , we have good reason to believe ( as will hereafter be more fully alluded to ) , would produce very vigorous seedlings , which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving . Some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectar-excreting power . Those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries , and which excreted most nectar , would be oftenest visited by insects , and would be oftenest crossed ; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand . Those flowers , also , which had their stamens and pistils placed , in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them , so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower , would likewise be favoured or selected . We might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar ; and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation , its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant ; yet if a little pollen were carried , at first occasionally and then habitually , by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower , and a cross thus effected , although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed , it might still be a great gain to the plant ; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen , and had larger and larger anthers , would be selected . When our plant , by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers , had been rendered highly attractive to insects , they would , unintentionally on their part , regularly carry pollen from flower to flower ; and that they can most effectually do this , I could easily show by many striking instances . I will give only one—not as a very striking case , but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants , presently to be alluded to . Some holly-trees bear only male flowers , which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen , and a rudimentary pistil ; other holly-trees bear only female flowers ; these have a full-sized pistil , and four stamens with shrivelled anthers , in which not a grain of pollen can be detected . Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree , I put the stigmas of twenty flowers , taken from different branches , under the microscope , and on all , without exception , there were pollen-grains , and on some a profusion of pollen . As the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree , the pollen could not thus have been carried . The weather had been cold and boisterous , and therefore not favourable to bees , nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees , accidentally dusted with pollen , having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar . But to return to our imaginary case : as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower , another process might commence . No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the “ physiological division of labour ; ” hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant , and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant . In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life , sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent ; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature , then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower , and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour , individuals with this tendency more and more increased , would be continually favoured or selected , until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected . Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case : we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection , to be a common plant ; and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food . I could give many facts , showing how anxious bees are to save time ; for instance , their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers , which they can , with a very little more trouble , enter by the mouth . Bearing such facts in mind , I can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body , or in the curvature and length of the proboscis , etc. , far too slight to be appreciated by us , might profit a bee or other insect , so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly , and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants . Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure . The tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers ( Trifolium pratense and incarnatum ) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length ; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover , but not out of the common red clover , which is visited by humble-bees alone ; so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee . Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis . On the other hand , I have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla , so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface . Hence , again , if humble-bees were to become rare in any country , it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla , so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers . Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become , either simultaneously or one after the other , modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other , by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure . Natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications , each profitable to the preserved being ; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave , so will natural selection , if it be a true principle , banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings , or of any great and sudden modification in their structure . _On the Intercrossing of Individuals_.—I must here introduce a short digression . In the case of animals and plants with separated sexes , it is of course obvious that two individuals must always unite for each birth ; but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious . Nevertheless I am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals , either occasionally or habitually , concur for the reproduction of their kind . This view , I may add , was first suggested by Andrew Knight . We shall presently see its importance ; but I must here treat the subject with extreme brevity , though I have the materials prepared for an ample discussion . All vertebrate animals , all insects , and some other large groups of animals , pair for each birth . Modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites , and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair ; that is , two individuals regularly unite for reproduction , which is all that concerns us . But still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair , and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites . What reason , it may be asked , is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction ? As it is impossible here to enter on details , I must trust to some general considerations alone . In the first place , I have collected so large a body of facts , showing , in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders , that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties , or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain , gives vigour and fertility to the offspring ; and on the other hand , that _close_ interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility ; that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature ( utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law ) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations ; but that a cross with another individual is occasionally—perhaps at very long intervals—indispensable . On the belief that this is a law of nature , we can , I think , understand several large classes of facts , such as the following , which on any other view are inexplicable . Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower , yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather ! but if an occasional cross be indispensable , the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure , more especially as the plant ’ s own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that self-fertilisation seems almost inevitable . Many flowers , on the other hand , have their organs of fructification closely enclosed , as in the great papilionaceous or pea-family ; but in several , perhaps in all , such flowers , there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar ; for , in doing this , they either push the flower ’ s own pollen on the stigma , or bring pollen from another flower . So necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers , that I have found , by experiments published elsewhere , that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented . Now , it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower , and not carry pollen from one to the other , to the great good , as I believe , of the plant . Bees will act like a camel-hair pencil , and it is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation ; but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species ; for if you bring on the same brush a plant ’ s own pollen and pollen from another species , the former will have such a prepotent effect , that it will invariably and completely destroy , as has been shown by Gärtner , any influence from the foreign pollen . When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil , or slowly move one after the other towards it , the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation ; and no doubt it is useful for this end : but , the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward , as Kölreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry ; and curiously in this very genus , which seems to have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation , it is well known that if very closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other , it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings , so largely do they naturally cross . In many other cases , far from there being any aids for self-fertilisation , there are special contrivances , as I could show from the writings of C. C. Sprengel and from my own observations , which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower : for instance , in Lobelia fulgens , there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower , before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them ; and as this flower is never visited , at least in my garden , by insects , it never sets a seed , though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another , I raised plenty of seedlings ; and whilst another species of Lobelia growing close by , which is visited by bees , seeds freely . In very many other cases , though there be no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen , yet , as C. C. Sprengel has shown , and as I can confirm , either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation , or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready , so that these plants have in fact separated sexes , and must habitually be crossed . How strange are these facts ! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower , though placed so close together , as if for the very purpose of self-fertilisation , should in so many cases be mutually useless to each other ! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable ! If several varieties of the cabbage , radish , onion , and of some other plants , be allowed to seed near each other , a large majority , as I have found , of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels : for instance , I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other , and of these only 78 were true to their kind , and some even of these were not perfectly true . Yet the pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens , but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant . How , then , comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized ? I suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct _variety_ having a prepotent effect over a flower ’ s own pollen ; and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species . When distinct _species_ are crossed the case is directly the reverse , for a plant ’ s own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen ; but to this subject we shall return in a future chapter . In the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers , it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree , and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree , and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense . I believe this objection to be valid , but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes . When the sexes are separated , although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree , we can see that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower ; and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree . That trees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants , I find to be the case in this country ; and at my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand , and Dr. Asa Gray those of the United States , and the result was as I anticipated . On the other hand , Dr. Hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold in Australia ; and I have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject . Turning for a very brief space to animals : on the land there are some hermaphrodites , as land-mollusca and earth-worms ; but these all pair . As yet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises itself . We can understand this remarkable fact , which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants , on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable , by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live , and the nature of the fertilising element ; for we know of no means , analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants , by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals . Of aquatic animals , there are many self-fertilising hermaphrodites ; but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross . And , as in the case of flowers , I have as yet failed , after consultation with one of the highest authorities , namely , Professor Huxley , to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body , that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible . Cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this point of view ; but I have been enabled , by a fortunate chance , elsewhere to prove that two individuals , though both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites , do sometimes cross . It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that , in the case of both animals and plants , species of the same family and even of the same genus , though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole organisation , yet are not rarely , some of them hermaphrodites , and some of them unisexual . But if , in fact , all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals , the difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species , as far as function is concerned , becomes very small . From these several considerations and from the many special facts which I have collected , but which I am not here able to give , I am strongly inclined to suspect that , both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms , an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature . I am well aware that there are , on this view , many cases of difficulty , some of which I am trying to investigate . Finally then , we may conclude that in many organic beings , a cross between two individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth ; in many others it occurs perhaps only at long intervals ; but in none , as I suspect , can self-fertilisation go on for perpetuity . _Circumstances favourable to Natural Selection_.—This is an extremely intricate subject . A large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable , but I believe mere individual differences suffice for the work . A large number of individuals , by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations , will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual , and is , I believe , an extremely important element of success . Though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection , she does not grant an indefinite period ; for as all organic beings are striving , it may be said , to seize on each place in the economy of nature , if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors , it will soon be exterminated . In man ’ s methodical selection , a breeder selects for some definite object , and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work . But when many men , without intending to alter the breed , have a nearly common standard of perfection , and all try to get and breed from the best animals , much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection , notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals . Thus it will be in nature ; for within a confined area , with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be , natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction , though in different degrees , so as better to fill up the unoccupied place . But if the area be large , its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life ; and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts , there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each . And in this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each ; for in a continuous area , the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another . The intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth , which wander much , and which do not breed at a very quick rate . Hence in animals of this nature , for instance in birds , varieties will generally be confined to separated countries ; and this I believe to be the case . In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally , and likewise in animals which unite for each birth , but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate , a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot , and might there maintain itself in a body , so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety . A local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts . On the above principle , nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety , as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened . Even in the case of slow-breeding animals , which unite for each birth , we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural selection ; for I can bring a considerable catalogue of facts , showing that within the same area , varieties of the same animal can long remain distinct , from haunting different stations , from breeding at slightly different seasons , or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together . Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species , or of the same variety , true and uniform in character . It will obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth ; but I have already attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants . Even if these take place only at long intervals , I am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation , that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind ; and thus , in the long run , the influence of intercrosses , even at rare intervals , will be great . If there exist organic beings which never intercross , uniformity of character can be retained amongst them , as long as their conditions of life remain the same , only through the principle of inheritance , and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type ; but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification , uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring , solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations . Isolation , also , is an important element in the process of natural selection . In a confined or isolated area , if not very large , the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree uniform ; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to the same conditions . Intercrosses , also , with the individuals of the same species , which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts , will be prevented . But isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better adapted organisms , after any physical change , such as of climate or elevation of the land , etc . ; and thus new places in the natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for , and become adapted to , through modifications in their structure and constitution . Lastly , isolation , by checking immigration and consequently competition , will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved ; and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species . If , however , an isolated area be very small , either from being surrounded by barriers , or from having very peculiar physical conditions , the total number of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small ; and fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new species through natural selection , by decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations . If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks , and look at any small isolated area , such as an oceanic island , although the total number of the species inhabiting it , will be found to be small , as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution ; yet of these species a very large proportion are endemic , —that is , have been produced there , and nowhere else . Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species . But we may thus greatly deceive ourselves , for to ascertain whether a small isolated area , or a large open area like a continent , has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms , we ought to make the comparison within equal times ; and this we are incapable of doing . Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species , on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more importance , more especially in the production of species , which will prove capable of enduring for a long period , and of spreading widely . Throughout a great and open area , not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported , but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species ; and if some of these many species become modified and improved , others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated . Each new form , also , as soon as it has been much improved , will be able to spread over the open and continuous area , and will thus come into competition with many others . Hence more new places will be formed , and the competition to fill them will be more severe , on a large than on a small and isolated area . Moreover , great areas , though now continuous , owing to oscillations of level , will often have recently existed in a broken condition , so that the good effects of isolation will generally , to a certain extent , have concurred . Finally , I conclude that , although small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species , yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas ; and what is more important , that the new forms produced on large areas , which already have been victorious over many competitors , will be those that will spread most widely , will give rise to most new varieties and species , and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world . We can , perhaps , on these views , understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution ; for instance , that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly yielded , and apparently are now yielding , before those of the larger Europæo-Asiatic area . Thus , also , it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands . On a small island , the race for life will have been less severe , and there will have been less modification and less extermination . Hence , perhaps , it comes that the flora of Madeira , according to Oswald Heer , resembles the extinct tertiary flora of Europe . All fresh-water basins , taken together , make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land ; and , consequently , the competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere ; new forms will have been more slowly formed , and old forms more slowly exterminated . And it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes , remnants of a once preponderant order : and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world , as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren , which , like fossils , connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale . These anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils ; they have endured to the present day , from having inhabited a confined area , and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition . To sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection , as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits . I conclude , looking to the future , that for terrestrial productions a large continental area , which will probably undergo many oscillations of level , and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition , will be the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life , likely to endure long and to spread widely . For the area will first have existed as a continent , and the inhabitants , at this period numerous in individuals and kinds , will have been subjected to very severe competition . When converted by subsidence into large separate islands , there will still exist many individuals of the same species on each island : intercrossing on the confines of the range of each species will thus be checked : after physical changes of any kind , immigration will be prevented , so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants ; and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected . When , by renewed elevation , the islands shall be re-converted into a continental area , there will again be severe competition : the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread : there will be much extinction of the less improved forms , and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed ; and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants , and thus produce new species . That natural selection will always act with extreme slowness , I fully admit . Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature , which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind . The existence of such places will often depend on physical changes , which are generally very slow , and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked . But the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified ; the mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed . Nothing can be effected , unless favourable variations occur , and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process . The process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing . Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection . I do not believe so . On the other hand , I do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly , often only at long intervals of time , and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time . I further believe , that this very slow , intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed . Slow though the process of selection may be , if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection , I can see no limit to the amount of change , to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings , one with another and with their physical conditions of life , which may be effected in the long course of time by nature ’ s power of selection . _Extinction_.—This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology ; but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection . Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous , which consequently endure . But as from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings , each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants , it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number , so will the less favoured forms decrease and become rare . Rarity , as geology tells us , is the precursor to extinction . We can , also , see that any form represented by few individuals will , during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies , run a good chance of utter extinction . But we may go further than this ; for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced , unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing , numbers inevitably must become extinct . That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased , geology shows us plainly ; and indeed we can see reason why they should not have thus increased , for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely great , —not that we have any means of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species . Probably no region is as yet fully stocked , for at the Cape of Good Hope , where more species of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world , some foreign plants have become naturalised , without causing , as far as we know , the extinction of any natives . Furthermore , the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations . We have evidence of this , in the facts given in the second chapter , showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded varieties , or incipient species . Hence , rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period , and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species . From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows , that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection , others will become rarer and rarer , and finally extinct . The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement , will naturally suffer most . And we have seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allied forms , —varieties of the same species , and species of the same genus or of related genera , —which , from having nearly the same structure , constitution , and habits , generally come into the severest competition with each other . Consequently , each new variety or species , during the progress of its formation , will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred , and tend to exterminate them . We see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions , through the selection of improved forms by man . Many curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle , sheep , and other animals , and varieties of flowers , take the place of older and inferior kinds . In Yorkshire , it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns , and that these “ were swept away by the short-horns ” ( I quote the words of an agricultural writer ) “ as if by some murderous pestilence. ” _Divergence of Character_.—The principle , which I have designated by this term , is of high importance on my theory , and explains , as I believe , several important facts . In the first place , varieties , even strongly-marked ones , though having somewhat of the character of species—as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them—yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species . Nevertheless , according to my view , varieties are species in the process of formation , or are , as I have called them , incipient species . How , then , does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species ? That this does habitually happen , we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting well-marked differences ; whereas varieties , the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species , present slight and ill-defined differences . Mere chance , as we may call it , might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents , and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree ; but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus . As has always been my practice , let us seek light on this head from our domestic productions . We shall here find something analogous . A fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak ; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak ; and on the acknowledged principle that “ fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard , but like extremes , ” they both go on ( as has actually occurred with tumbler-pigeons ) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks , or with shorter and shorter beaks . Again , we may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses ; another stronger and more bulky horses . The early differences would be very slight ; in the course of time , from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders , and of stronger ones by others , the differences would become greater , and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds ; finally , after the lapse of centuries , the sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds . As the differences slowly become greater , the inferior animals with intermediate characters , being neither very swift nor very strong , will have been neglected , and will have tended to disappear . Here , then , we see in man ’ s productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence , causing differences , at first barely appreciable , steadily to increase , and the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their common parent . But how , it may be asked , can any analogous principle apply in nature ? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently , from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure , constitution , and habits , by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature , and so be enabled to increase in numbers . We can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits . Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped , of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average . If its natural powers of increase be allowed to act , it can succeed in increasing ( the country not undergoing any change in its conditions ) only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals : some of them , for instance , being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey , either dead or alive ; some inhabiting new stations , climbing trees , frequenting water , and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous . The more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became , the more places they would be enabled to occupy . What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animals—that is , if they vary—for otherwise natural selection can do nothing . So it will be with plants . It has been experimentally proved , that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass , and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses , a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised . The same has been found to hold good when first one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground . Hence , if any one species of grass were to go on varying , and those varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses differ from each other , a greater number of individual plants of this species of grass , including its modified descendants , would succeed in living on the same piece of ground . And we well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds ; and thus , as it may be said , is striving its utmost to increase its numbers . Consequently , I can not doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations , the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers , and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties ; and varieties , when rendered very distinct from each other , take the rank of species . The truth of the principle , that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure , is seen under many natural circumstances . In an extremely small area , especially if freely open to immigration , and where the contest between individual and individual must be severe , we always find great diversity in its inhabitants . For instance , I found that a piece of turf , three feet by four in size , which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions , supported twenty species of plants , and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders , which shows how much these plants differed from each other . So it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets ; and so in small ponds of fresh water . Farmers find that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders : nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation . Most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground , could live on it ( supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature ) , and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there ; but , it is seen , that where they come into the closest competition with each other , the advantages of diversification of structure , with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution , determine that the inhabitants , which thus jostle each other most closely , shall , as a general rule , belong to what we call different genera and orders . The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man ’ s agency in foreign lands . It might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes ; for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country . It might , also , perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes . But the case is very different ; and Alph . De Candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable work , that floras gain by naturalisation , proportionally with the number of the native genera and species , far more in new genera than in new species . To give a single instance : in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray ’ s ‘ Manual of the Flora of the Northern United States , ’ 260 naturalised plants are enumerated , and these belong to 162 genera . We thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature . They differ , moreover , to a large extent from the indigenes , for out of the 162 genera , no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous , and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of these States . By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country , and have there become naturalised , we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have had to be modified , in order to have gained an advantage over the other natives ; and we may , I think , at least safely infer that diversification of structure , amounting to new generic differences , would have been profitable to them . The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is , in fact , the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual body—a subject so well elucidated by Milne Edwards . No physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone , or flesh alone , draws most nutriment from these substances . So in the general economy of any land , the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life , so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves . A set of animals , with their organisation but little diversified , could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure . It may be doubted , for instance , whether the Australian marsupials , which are divided into groups differing but little from each other , and feebly representing , as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked , our carnivorous , ruminant , and rodent mammals , could successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders . In the Australian mammals , we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development . After the foregoing discussion , which ought to have been much amplified , we may , I think , assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure , and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings . Now let us see how this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of character , combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction , will tend to act . The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject . Let A to L represent the species of a genus large in its own country ; these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees , as is so generally the case in nature , and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances . I have said a large genus , because we have seen in the second chapter , that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small genera ; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties . We have , also , seen that the species , which are the commonest and the most widely-diffused , vary more than rare species with restricted ranges . Let ( A ) be a common , widely-diffused , and varying species , belonging to a genus large in its own country . The little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from ( A ) , may represent its varying offspring . The variations are supposed to be extremely slight , but of the most diversified nature ; they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously , but often after long intervals of time ; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods . Only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected . And here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes in ; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations ( represented by the outer dotted lines ) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection . When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines , and is there marked by a small numbered letter , a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed a fairly well-marked variety , such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work . The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram , may represent each a thousand generations ; but it would have been better if each had represented ten thousand generations . After a thousand generations , species ( A ) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties , namely _a_1 and _m_1 . These two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable , and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary , consequently they will tend to vary , and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their parents varied . Moreover , these two varieties , being only slightly modified forms , will tend to inherit those advantages which made their common parent ( A ) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country ; they will likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent-species belonged , a large genus in its own country . And these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new varieties . If , then , these two varieties be variable , the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations . And after this interval , variety _a_1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety _a_2 , which will , owing to the principle of divergence , differ more from ( A ) than did variety _a_1 . Variety _m_1 is supposed to have produced two varieties , namely _m_2 and _s_2 , differing from each other , and more considerably from their common parent ( A ) . We may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time ; some of the varieties , after each thousand generations , producing only a single variety , but in a more and more modified condition , some producing two or three varieties , and some failing to produce any . Thus the varieties or modified descendants , proceeding from the common parent ( A ) , will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character . In the diagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation , and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation . But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram , though in itself made somewhat irregular . I am far from thinking that the most divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply : a medium form may often long endure , and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant ; for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings ; and this will depend on infinitely complex relations . But as a general rule , the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered , the more places they will be enabled to seize on , and the more their modified progeny will be increased . In our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties . But these breaks are imaginary , and might have been inserted anywhere , after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation . As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species , belonging to a large genus , will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life , they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character : this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from ( A ) . The modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent , will , it is probable , often take the place of , and so destroy , the earlier and less improved branches : this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines . In some cases I do not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent , and the number of the descendants will not be increased ; although the amount of divergent modification may have been increased in the successive generations . This case would be represented in the diagram , if all the lines proceeding from ( A ) were removed , excepting that from _a_1 to _a_10 . In the same way , for instance , the English race-horse and English pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks , without either having given off any fresh branches or races . After ten thousand generations , species ( A ) is supposed to have produced three forms , _a_10 , _f_10 , and _m_10 , which , from having diverged in character during the successive generations , will have come to differ largely , but perhaps unequally , from each other and from their common parent . If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small , these three forms may still be only well-marked varieties ; or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of sub-species ; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount , to convert these three forms into well-defined species : thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species . By continuing the same process for a greater number of generations ( as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner ) , we get eight species , marked by the letters between _a_14 and _m_14 , all descended from ( A ) . Thus , as I believe , species are multiplied and genera are formed . In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary . In the diagram I have assumed that a second species ( I ) has produced , by analogous steps , after ten thousand generations , either two well-marked varieties ( _w_10 and _z_10 ) or two species , according to the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines . After fourteen thousand generations , six new species , marked by the letters _n_14 to _z_14 , are supposed to have been produced . In each genus , the species , which are already extremely different in character , will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants ; for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature : hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species ( A ) , and the nearly extreme species ( I ) , as those which have largely varied , and have given rise to new varieties and species . The other nine species ( marked by capital letters ) of our original genus , may for a long period continue transmitting unaltered descendants ; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space . But during the process of modification , represented in the diagram , another of our principles , namely that of extinction , will have played an important part . As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms , there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent . For it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits , constitution , and structure . Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states , that is between the less and more improved state of a species , as well as the original parent-species itself , will generally tend to become extinct . So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent , which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent . If , however , the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country , or become quickly adapted to some quite new station , in which child and parent do not come into competition , both may continue to exist . If then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of modification , species ( A ) and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct , having been replaced by eight new species ( _a_14 to _m_14 ) ; and ( I ) will have been replaced by six ( _n_14 to _z_14 ) new species . But we may go further than this . The original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees , as is so generally the case in nature ; species ( A ) being more nearly related to B , C , and D , than to the other species ; and species ( I ) more to G , H , K , L , than to the others . These two species ( A ) and ( I ) , were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species , so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus . Their modified descendants , fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation , will probably have inherited some of the same advantages : they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent , so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country . It seems , therefore , to me extremely probable that they will have taken the places of , and thus exterminated , not only their parents ( A ) and ( I ) , but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents . Hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation . We may suppose that only one ( F ) , of the two species which were least closely related to the other nine original species , has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent . The new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species , will now be fifteen in number . Owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection , the extreme amount of difference in character between species _a_14 and _z_14 will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species . The new species , moreover , will be allied to each other in a widely different manner . Of the eight descendants from ( A ) the three marked _a_14 , _q_14 , _p_14 , will be nearly related from having recently branched off from _a_10 ; _b_14 and _f_14 , from having diverged at an earlier period from a5 , will be in some degree distinct from the three first-named species ; and lastly , _0_14 , _e_4 , and _m_14 , will be nearly related one to the other , but from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification , will be widely different from the other five species , and may constitute a sub-genus or even a distinct genus . The six descendants from ( I ) will form two sub-genera or even genera . But as the original species ( I ) differed largely from ( A ) , standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus , the six descendants from ( I ) will , owing to inheritance , differ considerably from the eight descendants from ( A ) ; the two groups , moreover , are supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions . The intermediate species , also ( and this is a very important consideration ) , which connected the original species ( A ) and ( I ) , have all become , excepting ( F ) , extinct , and have left no descendants . Hence the six new species descended from ( I ) , and the eight descended from ( A ) , will have to be ranked as very distinct genera , or even as distinct sub-families . Thus it is , as I believe , that two or more genera are produced by descent , with modification , from two or more species of the same genus . And the two or more parent-species are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus . In our diagram , this is indicated by the broken lines , beneath the capital letters , converging in sub-branches downwards towards a single point ; this point representing a single species , the supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera and genera . It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species F14 , which is supposed not to have diverged much in character , but to have retained the form of ( F ) , either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree . In this case , its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature . Having descended from a form which stood between the two parent-species ( A ) and ( I ) , now supposed to be extinct and unknown , it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species . But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents , the new species ( F14 ) will not be directly intermediate between them , but rather between types of the two groups ; and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind . In the diagram , each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to represent a thousand generations , but each may represent a million or hundred million generations , and likewise a section of the successive strata of the earth ’ s crust including extinct remains . We shall , when we come to our chapter on Geology , have to refer again to this subject , and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings , which , though generally belonging to the same orders , or families , or genera , with those now living , yet are often , in some degree , intermediate in character between existing groups ; and we can understand this fact , for the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less . I see no reason to limit the process of modification , as now explained , to the formation of genera alone . If , in our diagram , we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be very great , the forms marked _a_14 to _p_14 , those marked _b_14 and _f_14 , and those marked _o_14 to _m_14 , will form three very distinct genera . We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from ( I ) and as these latter two genera , both from continued divergence of character and from inheritance from a different parent , will differ widely from the three genera descended from ( A ) , the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families , or even orders , according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram . And the two new families , or orders , will have descended from two species of the original genus ; and these two species are supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus . We have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species . This , indeed , might have been expected ; for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence , it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage ; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common . Hence , the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants , will mainly lie between the larger groups , which are all trying to increase in number . One large group will slowly conquer another large group , reduce its numbers , and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement . Within the same large group , the later and more highly perfected sub-groups , from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of Nature , will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups . Small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally tend to disappear . Looking to the future , we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant , and which are least broken up , that is , which as yet have suffered least extinction , will for a long period continue to increase . But which groups will ultimately prevail , no man can predict ; for we well know that many groups , formerly most extensively developed , have now become extinct . Looking still more remotely to the future , we may predict that , owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups , a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct , and leave no modified descendants ; and consequently that of the species living at any one period , extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity . I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on Classification , but I may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants , and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class , we can understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms . Although extremely few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified descendants , yet at the most remote geological period , the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many genera , families , orders , and classes , as at the present day . _Summary of the Chapter_.—If during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life , organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation , and I think this can not be disputed ; if there be , owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species , at some age , season , or year , a severe struggle for life , and this certainly can not be disputed ; then , considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence , causing an infinite diversity in structure , constitution , and habits , to be advantageous to them , I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being ’ s own welfare , in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man . But if variations useful to any organic being do occur , assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life ; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised . This principle of preservation , I have called , for the sake of brevity , Natural Selection . Natural selection , on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages , can modify the egg , seed , or young , as easily as the adult . Amongst many animals , sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection , by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring . Sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone , in their struggles with other males . Whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature , in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations , must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters . But we already see how it entails extinction ; and how largely extinction has acted in the world ’ s history , geology plainly declares . Natural selection , also , leads to divergence of character ; for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure , habits , and constitution , of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spot or at naturalised productions . Therefore during the modification of the descendants of any one species , and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers , the more diversified these descendants become , the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle of life . Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species , will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus , or even of distinct genera . We have seen that it is the common , the widely-diffused , and widely-ranging species , belonging to the larger genera , which vary most ; and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries . Natural selection , as has just been remarked , leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life . On these principles , I believe , the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be explained . It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group , in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely , varieties of the same species most closely related together , species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together , forming sections and sub-genera , species of distinct genera much less closely related , and genera related in different degrees , forming sub-families , families , orders , sub-classes , and classes . The several subordinate groups in any class can not be ranked in a single file , but seem rather to be clustered round points , and these round other points , and so on in almost endless cycles . On the view that each species has been independently created , I can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings ; but , to the best of my judgment , it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection , entailing extinction and divergence of character , as we have seen illustrated in the diagram . The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree . I believe this simile largely speaks the truth . The green and budding twigs may represent existing species ; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species . At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides , and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches , in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life . The limbs divided into great branches , and these into lesser and lesser branches , were themselves once , when the tree was small , budding twigs ; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups . Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush , only two or three , now grown into great branches , yet survive and bear all the other branches ; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods , very few now have living and modified descendants . From the first growth of the tree , many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off ; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders , families , and genera which have now no living representatives , and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state . As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree , and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit , so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren , which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life , and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station . As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds , and these , if vigorous , branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch , so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life , which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth , and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications . CHAPTER V. LAWS OF VARIATION . Effects of external conditions . Use and disuse , combined with natural selection ; organs of flight and of vision . Acclimatisation . Correlation of growth . Compensation and economy of growth . False correlations . Multiple , rudimentary , and lowly organised structures variable . Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable : specific characters more variable than generic : secondary sexual characters variable . Species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner . Reversions to long lost characters . Summary . I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common and multiform in organic beings under domestication , and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature—had been due to chance . This , of course , is a wholly incorrect expression , but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation . Some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences , or very slight deviations of structure , as to make the child like its parents . But the much greater variability , as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities , under domestication or cultivation , than under nature , leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of life , to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several generations . I have remarked in the first chapter—but a long catalogue of facts which can not be here given would be necessary to show the truth of the remark—that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life ; and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents , I chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring . The male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new being . In the case of “ sporting ” plants , the bud , which in its earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule , is alone affected . But why , because the reproductive system is disturbed , this or that part should vary more or less , we are profoundly ignorant . Nevertheless , we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light , and we may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of structure , however slight . How much direct effect difference of climate , food , etc. , produces on any being is extremely doubtful . My impression is , that the effect is extremely small in the case of animals , but perhaps rather more in that of plants . We may , at least , safely conclude that such influences can not have produced the many striking and complex co-adaptations of structure between one organic being and another , which we see everywhere throughout nature . Some little influence may be attributed to climate , food , etc . : thus , E. Forbes speaks confidently that shells at their southern limit , and when living in shallow water , are more brightly coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater depths . Gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere , than when living on islands or near the coast . So with insects , Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects their colours . Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which when growing near the sea-shore have their leaves in some degree fleshy , though not elsewhere fleshy . Several other such cases could be given . The fact of varieties of one species , when they range into the zone of habitation of other species , often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species , accords with our view that species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties . Thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas . The birds which are confined to continents are , according to Mr. Gould , brighter-coloured than those of islands . The insect-species confined to sea-coasts , as every collector knows , are often brassy or lurid . Plants which live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves . He who believes in the creation of each species , will have to say that this shell , for instance , was created with bright colours for a warm sea ; but that this other shell became bright-coloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters . When a variation is of the slightest use to a being , we can not tell how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection , and how much to the conditions of life . Thus , it is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more severe the climate is under which they have lived ; but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations , and how much to the direct action of the severe climate ? for it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds . Instances could be given of the same variety being produced under conditions of life as different as can well be conceived ; and , on the other hand , of different varieties being produced from the same species under the same conditions . Such facts show how indirectly into the zone of habitation of other species , often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species , accords with our view that species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties . Thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas . The birds which are confined to continents are , according to Mr. Gould , brighter-coloured than those of islands . The insect-species confined to sea-coasts , as every collector knows , are often brassy or lurid . Plants which live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves . He who believes in the creation of each species , will have to say that this shell , for instance , was created with bright colours for a warm sea ; but that this other shell became bright-coloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters . the conditions of life must act . Again , innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of species keeping true , or not varying at all , although living under the most opposite climates . Such considerations as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the conditions of life . Indirectly , as already remarked , they seem to play an important part in affecting the reproductive system , and in thus inducing variability ; and natural selection will then accumulate all profitable variations , however slight , until they become plainly developed and appreciable by us . _Effects of Use and Disuse_.—From the facts alluded to in the first chapter , I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts , and disuse diminishes them ; and that such modifications are inherited . Under free nature , we can have no standard of comparison , by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse , for we know not the parent-forms ; but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse . As Professor Owen has remarked , there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that can not fly ; yet there are several in this state . The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along the surface of the water , and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck . As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger , I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds , which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands , tenanted by no beast of prey , has been caused by disuse . The ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it can not escape by flight , but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies , as well as any of the smaller quadrupeds . We may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard , and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body , its legs were used more , and its wings less , until they became incapable of flight . Kirby has remarked ( and I have observed the same fact ) that the anterior tarsi , or feet , of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken off ; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection , and not one had even a relic left . In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost , that the insect has been described as not having them . In some other genera they are present , but in a rudimentary condition . In the Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians , they are totally deficient . There is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe that mutilations are ever inherited ; and I should prefer explaining the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus , and their rudimentary condition in some other genera , by the long-continued effects of disuse in their progenitors ; for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung-feeding beetles , they must be lost early in life , and therefore can not be much used by these insects . In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure which are wholly , or mainly , due to natural selection . Mr. Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles , out of the 550 species inhabiting Madeira , are so far deficient in wings that they can not fly ; and that of the twenty-nine endemic genera , no less than twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition ! Several facts , namely , that beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea and perish ; that the beetles in Madeira , as observed by Mr. Wollaston , lie much concealed , until the wind lulls and the sun shines ; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Dezertas than in Madeira itself ; and especially the extraordinary fact , so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston , of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles , elsewhere excessively numerous , and which groups have habits of life almost necessitating frequent flight ; —these several considerations have made me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection , but combined probably with disuse . For during thousands of successive generations each individual beetle which flew least , either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit , will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea ; and , on the other hand , those beetles which most readily took to flight will oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed . The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders , and which , as the flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera , must habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence , have , as Mr. Wollaston suspects , their wings not at all reduced , but even enlarged . This is quite compatible with the action of natural selection . For when a new insect first arrived on the island , the tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings , would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds , or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying . As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast , it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further , whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck . The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size , and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur . This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse , but aided perhaps by natural selection . In South America , a burrowing rodent , the tuco-tuco , or Ctenomys , is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole ; and I was assured by a Spaniard , who had often caught them , that they were frequently blind ; one which I kept alive was certainly in this condition , the cause , as appeared on dissection , having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane . As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal , and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with subterranean habits , a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them , might in such case be an advantage ; and if so , natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse . It is well known that several animals , belonging to the most different classes , which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky , are blind . In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains , though the eye is gone ; the stand for the telescope is there , though the telescope with its glasses has been lost . As it is difficult to imagine that eyes , though useless , could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness , I attribute their loss wholly to disuse . In one of the blind animals , namely , the cave-rat , the eyes are of immense size ; and Professor Silliman thought that it regained , after living some days in the light , some slight power of vision . In the same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged , and the wings of others have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse , so in the case of the cave-rat natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes ; whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves , disuse by itself seems to have done its work . It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate ; so that on the common view of the blind animals having been separately created for the American and European caverns , close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been expected ; but , as Schiödte and others have remarked , this is not the case , and the cave-insects of the two continents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of North America and Europe . On my view we must suppose that American animals , having ordinary powers of vision , slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves , as did European animals into the caves of Europe . We have some evidence of this gradation of habit ; for , as Schiödte remarks , “ animals not far remote from ordinary forms , prepare the transition from light to darkness . Next follow those that are constructed for twilight ; and , last of all , those destined for total darkness. ” By the time that an animal had reached , after numberless generations , the deepest recesses , disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes , and natural selection will often have effected other changes , such as an increase in the length of the antennæ or palpi , as a compensation for blindness . Notwithstanding such modifications , we might expect still to see in the cave-animals of America , affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent , and in those of Europe , to the inhabitants of the European continent . And this is the case with some of the American cave-animals , as I hear from Professor Dana ; and some of the European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country . It would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation . That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should be closely related , we might expect from the well-known relationship of most of their other productions . Far from feeling any surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous , as Agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish , the Amblyopsis , and as is the case with the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe , I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved , owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will probably have been exposed . _Acclimatisation_.—Habit is hereditary with plants , as in the period of flowering , in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate , in the time of sleep , etc. , and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation . As it is extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and very cold countries , and as I believe that all the species of the same genus have descended from a single parent , if this view be correct , acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued descent . It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home : species from an arctic or even from a temperate region can not endure a tropical climate , or conversely . So again , many succulent plants can not endure a damp climate . But the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated . We may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate , and from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health . We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as , or more than , by adaptation to particular climates . But whether or not the adaptation be generally very close , we have evidence , in the case of some few plants , of their becoming , to a certain extent , naturally habituated to different temperatures , or becoming acclimatised : thus the pines and rhododendrons , raised from seed collected by Dr. Hooker from trees growing at different heights on the Himalaya , were found in this country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold . Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon , and analogous observations have been made by Mr. H. C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the Azores to England . In regard to animals , several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes , and conversely ; but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate , but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case ; nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes . As I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under confinement , and not because they were subsequently found capable of far-extended transportation , I think the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates but of being perfectly fertile ( a far severer test ) under them , may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals , now in a state of nature , could easily be brought to bear widely different climates . We must not , however , push the foregoing argument too far , on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild stocks : the blood , for instance , of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds . The rat and mouse can not be considered as domestic animals , but they have been transported by man to many parts of the world , and now have a far wider range than any other rodent , living free under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south , and on many islands in the torrid zones . Hence I am inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution , which is common to most animals . On this view , the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals , and such facts as that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a glacial climate , whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits , ought not to be looked at as anomalies , but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution , brought , under peculiar circumstances , into play . How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit , and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions , and how much to both means combined , is a very obscure question . That habit or custom has some influence I must believe , both from analogy , and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works , even in the ancient Encyclopædias of China , to be very cautious in transposing animals from one district to another ; for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts : the result must , I think , be due to habit . On the other hand , I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries . In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants , certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others : this is very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the United States , in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern , and others for the southern States ; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin , they can not owe their constitutional differences to habit . The case of the Jerusalem artichoke , which is never propagated by seed , and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced , has even been advanced—for it is now as tender as ever it was—as proving that acclimatisation can not be effected ! The case , also , of the kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose , and with much greater weight ; but until some one will sow , during a score of generations , his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost , and then collect seed from the few survivors , with care to prevent accidental crosses , and then again get seed from these seedlings , with the same precautions , the experiment can not be said to have been even tried . Nor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear , for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than others . On the whole , I think we may conclude that habit , use , and disuse , have , in some cases , played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution , and of the structure of various organs ; but that the effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with , and sometimes overmastered by , the natural selection of innate differences . _Correlation of Growth_.—I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its growth and development , that when slight variations in any one part occur , and are accumulated through natural selection , other parts become modified . This is a very important subject , most imperfectly understood . The most obvious case is , that modifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva , will , it may safely be concluded , affect the structure of the adult ; in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo , seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult . The several parts of the body which are homologous , and which , at an early embryonic period , are alike , seem liable to vary in an allied manner : we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner ; in the front and hind legs , and even in the jaws and limbs , varying together , for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs . These tendencies , I do not doubt , may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection : thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side ; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection . Homologous parts , as has been remarked by some authors , tend to cohere ; this is often seen in monstrous plants ; and nothing is more common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures , as the union of the petals of the corolla into a tube . Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts ; it is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys . Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child . In snakes , according to Schlegel , the shape of the body and the manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera . The nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure . M. Is . Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked , that certain malconformations very frequently , and that others rarely coexist , without our being able to assign any reason . What can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats , and the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex ; the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons , and the presence of more or less down on the young birds when first hatched , with the future colour of their plumage ; or , again , the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog , though here probably homology comes into play ? With respect to this latter case of correlation , I think it can hardly be accidental , that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal coverings , viz . Cetacea ( whales ) and Edentata ( armadilloes , scaly ant-eaters , etc . ) , that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth . I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures , independently of utility and , therefore , of natural selection , than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants . Every one knows the difference in the ray and central florets of , for instance , the daisy , and this difference is often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower . But , in some Compositous plants , the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture ; and even the ovary itself , with its accessory parts , differs , as has been described by Cassini . These differences have been attributed by some authors to pressure , and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets in some Compositæ countenances this idea ; but , in the case of the corolla of the Umbelliferæ , it is by no means , as Dr. Hooker informs me , in species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most frequently differ . It might have been thought that the development of the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the flower had caused their abortion ; but in some Compositæ there is a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any difference in the corolla . Possibly , these several differences may be connected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central and external flowers : we know , at least , that in irregular flowers , those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria , and become regular . I may add , as an instance of this , and of a striking case of correlation , that I have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums , that the central flower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two upper petals ; and that when this occurs , the adherent nectary is quite aborted ; when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals , the nectary is only much shortened . With respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel , I do not feel at all sure that C. C. Sprengel ’ s idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects , whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these two orders , is so far-fetched , as it may at first appear : and if it be advantageous , natural selection may have come into play . But in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds , which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers , it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant : yet in the Umbelliferæ these differences are of such apparent importance—the seeds being in some cases , according to Tausch , orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers , —that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences . Hence we see that modifications of structure , viewed by systematists as of high value , may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth , and without being , as far as we can see , of the slightest service to the species . We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth , structures which are common to whole groups of species , and which in truth are simply due to inheritance ; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure , and , after thousands of generations , some other and independent modification ; and these two modifications , having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits , would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner . So , again , I do not doubt that some apparent correlations , occurring throughout whole orders , are entirely due to the manner alone in which natural selection can act . For instance , Alph . De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open : I should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection , except in fruits which opened ; so that the individual plants producing seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further , might get an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal ; and this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open . The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded , at about the same period , their law of compensation or balancement of growth ; or , as Goethe expressed it , “ in order to spend on one side , nature is forced to economise on the other side. ” I think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions : if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess , it rarely flows , at least in excess , to another part ; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily . The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds . When the seeds in our fruits become atrophied , the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality . In our poultry , a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb , and a large beard by diminished wattles . With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application ; but many good observers , more especially botanists , believe in its truth . I will not , however , here give any instances , for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects , on the one hand , of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same process or by disuse , and , on the other hand , the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part . I suspect , also , that some of the cases of compensation which have been advanced , and likewise some other facts , may be merged under a more general principle , namely , that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation . If under changed conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful , any diminution , however slight , in its development , will be seized on by natural selection , for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure . I can thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes , and of which many other instances could be given : namely , that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected , it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace . This is the case with the male Ibla , and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas : for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously developed , and furnished with great nerves and muscles ; but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas , the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antennæ . Now the saving of a large and complex structure , when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the Proteolepas , though effected by slow steps , would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species ; for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed , each individual Proteolepas would have a better chance of supporting itself , by less nutriment being wasted in developing a structure now become useless . Thus , as I believe , natural selection will always succeed in the long run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation , as soon as it is rendered superfluous , without by any means causing some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree . And , conversely , that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ , without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part . It seems to be a rule , as remarked by Is . Geoffroy St. Hilaire , both in varieties and in species , that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the structure of the same individual ( as the vertebræ in snakes , and the stamens in polyandrous flowers ) the number is variable ; whereas the number of the same part or organ , when it occurs in lesser numbers , is constant . The same author and some botanists have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure . Inasmuch as this “ vegetative repetition , ” to use Professor Owen ’ s expression , seems to be a sign of low organisation ; the foregoing remark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists , that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which are higher . I presume that lowness in this case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions ; and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work , we can perhaps see why it should remain variable , that is , why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one special purpose alone . In the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape ; whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some particular shape . Natural selection , it should never be forgotten , can act on each part of each being , solely through and for its advantage . Rudimentary parts , it has been stated by some authors , and I believe with truth , are apt to be highly variable . We shall have to recur to the general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs ; and I will here only add that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness , and therefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure . Thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws of growth , to the effects of long-continued disuse , and to the tendency to reversion . _A part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner , in comparison with the same part in allied species , tends to be highly variable_.—Several years ago I was much struck with a remark , nearly to the above effect , published by Mr. Waterhouse . I infer also from an observation made by Professor Owen , with respect to the length of the arms of the ourang-outang , that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion . It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition without giving the long array of facts which I have collected , and which can not possibly be here introduced . I can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality . I am aware of several causes of error , but I hope that I have made due allowance for them . It should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part , however unusually developed , unless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in closely allied species . Thus , the bat ’ s wing is a most abnormal structure in the class mammalia ; but the rule would not here apply , because there is a whole group of bats having wings ; it would apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus . The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters , when displayed in any unusual manner . The term , secondary sexual characters , used by Hunter , applies to characters which are attached to one sex , but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction . The rule applies to males and females ; but as females more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters , it applies more rarely to them . The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters , may be due to the great variability of these characters , whether or not displayed in any unusual manner—of which fact I think there can be little doubt . But that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes ; and I may here add , that I particularly attended to Mr. Waterhouse ’ s remark , whilst investigating this Order , and I am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with cirripedes . I shall , in my future work , give a list of the more remarkable cases ; I will here only briefly give one , as it illustrates the rule in its largest application . The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes ( rock barnacles ) are , in every sense of the word , very important structures , and they differ extremely little even in different genera ; but in the several species of one genus , Pyrgoma , these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification : the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape ; and the amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so great , that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the characters of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera . As birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree , I have particularly attended to them , and the rule seems to me certainly to hold good in this class . I can not make out that it applies to plants , and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth , had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability . When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in any species , the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to that species ; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to variation . Why should this be so ? On the view that each species has been independently created , with all its parts as we now see them , I can see no explanation . But on the view that groups of species have descended from other species , and have been modified through natural selection , I think we can obtain some light . In our domestic animals , if any part , or the whole animal , be neglected and no selection be applied , that part ( for instance , the comb in the Dorking fowl ) or the whole breed will cease to have a nearly uniform character . The breed will then be said to have degenerated . In rudimentary organs , and in those which have been but little specialised for any particular purpose , and perhaps in polymorphic groups , we see a nearly parallel natural case ; for in such cases natural selection either has not or can not come into full play , and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition . But what here more especially concerns us is , that in our domestic animals those points , which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued selection , are also eminently liable to variation . Look at the breeds of the pigeon ; see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers , in the beak and wattle of the different carriers , in the carriage and tail of our fantails , etc. , these being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers . Even in the sub-breeds , as in the short-faced tumbler , it is notoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection , and frequently individuals are born which depart widely from the standard . There may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between , on the one hand , the tendency to reversion to a less modified state , as well as an innate tendency to further variability of all kinds , and , on the other hand , the power of steady selection to keep the breed true . In the long run selection gains the day , and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain . But as long as selection is rapidly going on , there may always be expected to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification . It further deserves notice that these variable characters , produced by man ’ s selection , sometimes become attached , from causes quite unknown to us , more to one sex than to the other , generally to the male sex , as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters . Now let us turn to nature . When a part has been developed in an extraordinary manner in any one species , compared with the other species of the same genus , we may conclude that this part has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification , since the period when the species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus . This period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree , as species very rarely endure for more than one geological period . An extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability , which has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species . But as the variability of the extraordinarily-developed part or organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not excessively remote , we might , as a general rule , expect still to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation , which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant . And this , I am convinced , is the case . That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand , and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand , will in the course of time cease ; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant , I can see no reason to doubt . Hence when an organ , however abnormal it may be , has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants , as in the case of the wing of the bat , it must have existed , according to my theory , for an immense period in nearly the same state ; and thus it comes to be no more variable than any other structure . It is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the _generative variability_ , as it may be called , still present in a high degree . For in this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner and degree , and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition . The principle included in these remarks may be extended . It is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic . To explain by a simple example what is meant . If some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and some had red , the colour would be only a specific character , and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red , or conversely ; but if all the species had blue flowers , the colour would become a generic character , and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance . I have chosen this example because an explanation is not in this case applicable , which most naturalists would advance , namely , that specific characters are more variable than generic , because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera . I believe this explanation is partly , yet only indirectly , true ; I shall , however , have to return to this subject in our chapter on Classification . It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement , that specific characters are more variable than generic ; but I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history , that when an author has remarked with surprise that some _important_ organ or part , which is generally very constant throughout large groups of species , has _differed_ considerably in closely-allied species , that it has , also , been _variable_ in the individuals of some of the species . And this fact shows that a character , which is generally of generic value , when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value , often becomes variable , though its physiological importance may remain the same . Something of the same kind applies to monstrosities : at least Is . Geoffroy St. Hilaire seems to entertain no doubt , that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group , the more subject it is to individual anomalies . On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created , why should that part of the structure , which differs from the same part in other independently-created species of the same genus , be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several species ? I do not see that any explanation can be given . But on the view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties , we might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period , and which have thus come to differ . Or to state the case in another manner : —the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other , and in which they differ from the species of some other genus , are called generic characters ; and these characters in common I attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor , for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several species , fitted to more or less widely-different habits , in exactly the same manner : and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited from a remote period , since that period when the species first branched off from their common progenitor , and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree , or only in a slight degree , it is not probable that they should vary at the present day . On the other hand , the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus , are called specific characters ; and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor , it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable , —at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant . In connexion with the present subject , I will make only two other remarks . I think it will be admitted , without my entering on details , that secondary sexual characters are very variable ; I think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters , than in other parts of their organisation ; compare , for instance , the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds , in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed , with the amount of difference between their females ; and the truth of this proposition will be granted . The cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest ; but we can see why these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation ; for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection , which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection , as it does not entail death , but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males . Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters , as they are highly variable , sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action , and may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their sexual characters , than in other parts of their structure . It is a remarkable fact , that the secondary sexual differences between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus differ from each other . Of this fact I will give in illustration two instances , the first which happen to stand on my list ; and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature , the relation can hardly be accidental . The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles , but in the Engidæ , as Westwood has remarked , the number varies greatly ; and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species : again in fossorial hymenoptera , the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance , because common to large groups ; but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species , and likewise in the two sexes of the same species . This relation has a clear meaning on my view of the subject : I look at all the species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor , as have the two sexes of any one of the species . Consequently , whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor , or of its early descendants , became variable ; variations of this part would it is highly probable , be taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection , in order to fit the several species to their several places in the economy of nature , and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other , or to fit the males and females to different habits of life , or the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females . Finally , then , I conclude that the greater variability of specific characters , or those which distinguish species from species , than of generic characters , or those which the species possess in common ; —that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners ; and the not great degree of variability in a part , however extraordinarily it may be developed , if it be common to a whole group of species ; —that the great variability of secondary sexual characters , and the great amount of difference in these same characters between closely allied species ; —that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation , —are all principles closely connected together . All being mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor , from whom they have inherited much in common , —to parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied , —to natural selection having more or less completely , according to the lapse of time , overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability , —to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection , —and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection , and thus adapted for secondary sexual , and for ordinary specific purposes . _Distinct species present analogous variations ; and a variety of one species often assumes some of the characters of an allied species , or reverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor_.—These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic races . The most distinct breeds of pigeons , in countries most widely apart , present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on the feet , —characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon ; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races . The frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter , may be considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another race , the fantail . I presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation , when acted on by similar unknown influences . In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation , in the enlarged stems , or roots as commonly called , of the Swedish turnip and Ruta baga , plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent : if this be not so , the case will then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct species ; and to these a third may be added , namely , the common turnip . According to the ordinary view of each species having been independently created , we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants , not to the vera causa of community of descent , and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner , but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation . With pigeons , however , we have another case , namely , the occasional appearance in all the breeds , of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on the wings , a white rump , a bar at the end of the tail , with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white . As all these marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon , I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion , and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds . We may I think confidently come to this conclusion , because , as we have seen , these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds ; and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue , with the several marks , beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance . No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many , perhaps for hundreds of generations . But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed , the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed for many generations—some say , for a dozen or even a score of generations . After twelve generations , the proportion of blood , to use a common expression , of any one ancestor , is only 1 in 2048 ; and yet , as we see , it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood . In a breed which has not been crossed , but in which _both_ parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed , the tendency , whether strong or weak , to reproduce the lost character might be , as was formerly remarked , for all that we can see to the contrary , transmitted for almost any number of generations . When a character which has been lost in a breed , reappears after a great number of generations , the most probable hypothesis is , not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations distant , but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in question , which at last , under unknown favourable conditions , gains an ascendancy . For instance , it is probable that in each generation of the barb-pigeon , which produces most rarely a blue and black-barred bird , there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume this colour . This view is hypothetical , but could be supported by some facts ; and I can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of generations , than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being , as we all know them to be , thus inherited . Indeed , we may sometimes observe a mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited : for instance , in the common snapdragon ( Antirrhinum ) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears , that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it . As all the species of the same genus are supposed , on my theory , to have descended from a common parent , it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner ; so that a variety of one species would resemble in some of its characters another species ; this other species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety . But characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature , for the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection , in accordance with the diverse habits of the species , and will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution . It might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters . As , however , we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a group , we could not distinguish these two cases : if , for instance , we did not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned , we could not have told , whether these characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations ; but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion , from the number of the markings , which are correlated with the blue tint , and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from simple variation . More especially we might have inferred this , from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed . Hence , though under nature it must generally be left doubtful , what cases are reversions to an anciently existing character , and what are new but analogous variations , yet we ought , on my theory , sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming characters ( either from reversion or from analogous variation ) which already occur in some other members of the same group . And this undoubtedly is the case in nature . A considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in our systematic works , is due to its varieties mocking , as it were , some of the other species of the same genus . A considerable catalogue , also , could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms , which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species ; and this shows , unless all these forms be considered as independently created species , that the one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other , so as to produce the intermediate form . But the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire , in some degree , the character of the same part or organ in an allied species . I have collected a long list of such cases ; but here , as before , I lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give them . I can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur , and seem to me very remarkable . I will , however , give one curious and complex case , not indeed as affecting any important character , but from occurring in several species of the same genus , partly under domestication and partly under nature . It is a case apparently of reversion . The ass not rarely has very distinct transverse bars on its legs , like those on the legs of a zebra : it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal , and from inquiries which I have made , I believe this to be true . It has also been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double . The shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline . A white ass , but _not_ an albino , has been described without either spinal or shoulder-stripe ; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure , or actually quite lost , in dark-coloured asses . The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe . The hemionus has no shoulder-stripe ; but traces of it , as stated by Mr. Blyth and others , occasionally appear : and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs , and faintly on the shoulder . The quagga , though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body , is without bars on the legs ; but Dr. Gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks . With respect to the horse , I have collected cases in England of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds , and of _all_ colours ; transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns , mouse-duns , and in one instance in a chestnut : a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in duns , and I have seen a trace in a bay horse . My son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes ; and a man , whom I can implicitly trust , has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with _three_ short parallel stripes on each shoulder . In the north-west part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped , that , as I hear from Colonel Poole , who examined the breed for the Indian Government , a horse without stripes is not considered as purely-bred . The spine is always striped ; the legs are generally barred ; and the shoulder-stripe , which is sometimes double and sometimes treble , is common ; the side of the face , moreover , is sometimes striped . The stripes are plainest in the foal ; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses . Colonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled . I have , also , reason to suspect , from information given me by Mr. W. W. Edwards , that with the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the full-grown animal . Without here entering on further details , I may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds , in various countries from Britain to Eastern China ; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south . In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse-duns ; by the term dun a large range of colour is included , from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream-colour . I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith , who has written on this subject , believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several aboriginal species—one of which , the dun , was striped ; and that the above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun stock . But I am not at all satisfied with this theory , and should be loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy Belgian cart-horse , Welch ponies , cobs , the lanky Kattywar race , etc. , inhabiting the most distant parts of the world . Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horse-genus . Rollin asserts , that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs . I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra ; and Mr. W. C. Martin , in his excellent treatise on the horse , has given a figure of a similar mule . In four coloured drawings , which I have seen , of hybrids between the ass and zebra , the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body ; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe . In Lord Moreton ’ s famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga , the hybrid , and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire , were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga . Lastly , and this is another most remarkable case , a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray ( and he informs me that he knows of a second case ) from the ass and the hemionus ; and this hybrid , though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe , nevertheless had all four legs barred , and had three short shoulder-stripes , like those on the dun Welch pony , and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face . With respect to this last fact , I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an accident , that I was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus , to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses , and was , as we have seen , answered in the affirmative . What now are we to say to these several facts ? We see several very distinct species of the horse-genus becoming , by simple variation , striped on the legs like a zebra , or striped on the shoulders like an ass . In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears—a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus . The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character . We see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species . Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons : they are descended from a pigeon ( including two or three sub-species or geographical races ) of a bluish colour , with certain bars and other marks ; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint , these bars and other marks invariably reappear ; but without any other change of form or character . When the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed , we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels . I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters , is—that there is a _tendency_ in the young of each successive generation to produce the long-lost character , and that this tendency , from unknown causes , sometimes prevails . And we have just seen that in several species of the horse-genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old . Call the breeds of pigeons , some of which have bred true for centuries , species ; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse-genus ! For myself , I venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations , and I see an animal striped like a zebra , but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed , the common parent of our domestic horse , whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks , of the ass , the hemionus , quagga , and zebra . He who believes that each equine species was independently created , will , I presume , assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary , both under nature and under domestication , in this particular manner , so as often to become striped like other species of the genus ; and that each has been created with a strong tendency , when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world , to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes , not their own parents , but other species of the genus . To admit this view is , as it seems to me , to reject a real for an unreal , or at least for an unknown , cause . It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception ; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists , that fossil shells had never lived , but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore . _Summary_.—Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound . Not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part differs , more or less , from the same part in the parents . But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison , the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species , and the greater differences between species of the same genus . The external conditions of life , as climate and food , etc. , seem to have induced some slight modifications . Habit in producing constitutional differences , and use in strengthening , and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs , seem to have been more potent in their effects . Homologous parts tend to vary in the same way , and homologous parts tend to cohere . Modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts . When one part is largely developed , perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts ; and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment to the individual , will be saved .

ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES . INTRODUCTION . When on board H.M.S . ‘ Beagle , ’ as naturalist , I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America , and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent . These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries , as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers . On my return home , it occurred to me , in 1837 , that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it . After five years ’ work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject , and drew up some short notes ; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions , which then seemed to me probable : from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object . I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details , as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision . My work is now nearly finished ; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it , and as my health is far from strong , I have been urged to publish this Abstract . I have more especially been induced to do this , as Mr. Wallace , who is now studying the natural history of the Malay archipelago , has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species . Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker , who both knew of my work—the latter having read my sketch of 1844—honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish , with Mr. Wallace ’ s excellent memoir , some brief extracts from my manuscripts . This Abstract , which I now publish , must necessarily be imperfect . I can not here give references and authorities for my several statements ; and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy . No doubt errors will have crept in , though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone . I can here give only the general conclusions at which I have arrived , with a few facts in illustration , but which , I hope , in most cases will suffice . No one can feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts , with references , on which my conclusions have been grounded ; and I hope in a future work to do this . For I am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts can not be adduced , often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which I have arrived . A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question ; and this can not possibly be here done . I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very many naturalists , some of them personally unknown to me . I can not , however , let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to Dr. Hooker , who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment . In considering the Origin of Species , it is quite conceivable that a naturalist , reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings , on their embryological relations , their geographical distribution , geological succession , and other such facts , might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created , but had descended , like varieties , from other species . Nevertheless , such a conclusion , even if well founded , would be unsatisfactory , until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified , so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration . Naturalists continually refer to external conditions , such as climate , food , etc. , as the only possible cause of variation . In one very limited sense , as we shall hereafter see , this may be true ; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions , the structure , for instance , of the woodpecker , with its feet , tail , beak , and tongue , so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees . In the case of the misseltoe , which draws its nourishment from certain trees , which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds , and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other , it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite , with its relations to several distinct organic beings , by the effects of external conditions , or of habit , or of the volition of the plant itself . The author of the ‘ Vestiges of Creation ’ would , I presume , say that , after a certain unknown number of generations , some bird had given birth to a woodpecker , and some plant to the misseltoe , and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them ; but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation , for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life , untouched and unexplained . It is , therefore , of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation . At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem . Nor have I been disappointed ; in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge , imperfect though it be , of variation under domestication , afforded the best and safest clue . I may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies , although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists . From these considerations , I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract to Variation under Domestication . We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible , and , what is equally or more important , we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations . I will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature ; but I shall , unfortunately , be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly , as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts . We shall , however , be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation . In the next chapter the Struggle for Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world , which inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase , will be treated of . This is the doctrine of Malthus , applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms . As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive ; and as , consequently , there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence , it follows that any being , if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself , under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life , will have a better chance of surviving , and thus be _naturally selected_ . From the strong principle of inheritance , any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form . This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter ; and we shall then see how Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved forms of life and induces what I have called Divergence of Character . In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and of correlation of growth . In the four succeeding chapters , the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given : namely , first , the difficulties of transitions , or in understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ ; secondly the subject of Instinct , or the mental powers of animals , thirdly , Hybridism , or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed ; and fourthly , the imperfection of the Geological Record . In the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time ; in the eleventh and twelfth , their geographical distribution throughout space ; in the thirteenth , their classification or mutual affinities , both when mature and in an embryonic condition . In the last chapter I shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work , and a few concluding remarks . No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties , if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us . Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous , and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare ? Yet these relations are of the highest importance , for they determine the present welfare , and , as I believe , the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world . Still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history . Although much remains obscure , and will long remain obscure , I can entertain no doubt , after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable , that the view which most naturalists entertain , and which I formerly entertained—namely , that each species has been independently created—is erroneous . I am fully convinced that species are not immutable ; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species , in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species . Furthermore , I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification . CHAPTER I . VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION . Causes of Variability . Effects of Habit .

Circumstances favourable to Man ’ s power of Selection . When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals , one of the first points which strikes us , is , that they generally differ much more from each other , than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature . When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated , and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment , I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as , and somewhat different from , those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature . There is , also , I think , some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight , that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food . It seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation ; and that when the organisation has once begun to vary , it generally continues to vary for many generations . No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation . Our oldest cultivated plants , such as wheat , still often yield new varieties : our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification . It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability , whatever they may be , generally act ; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo , or at the instant of conception . Geoffroy St. Hilaire ’ s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities ; and monstrosities can not be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations . But I am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception . Several reasons make me believe in this ; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system ; this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation , to the action of any change in the conditions of life . Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal , and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement , even in the many cases when the male and female unite . How many animals there are which will not breed , though living long under not very close confinement in their native country ! This is generally attributed to vitiated instincts ; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour , and yet rarely or never seed ! In some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling changes , such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth , will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed . I can not here enter on the copious details which I have collected on this curious subject ; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement , I may just mention that carnivorous animals , even from the tropics , breed in this country pretty freely under confinement , with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family ; whereas , carnivorous birds , with the rarest exceptions , hardly ever lay fertile eggs . Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless , in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids . When , on the one hand , we see domesticated animals and plants , though often weak and sickly , yet breeding quite freely under confinement ; and when , on the other hand , we see individuals , though taken young from a state of nature , perfectly tamed , long-lived , and healthy ( of which I could give numerous instances ) , yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting , we need not be surprised at this system , when it does act under confinement , acting not quite regularly , and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or variable . Sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture ; but on this view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility ; and variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden . I may add , that as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions ( for instance , the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches ) , showing that their reproductive system has not been thus affected ; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation , and vary very slightly—perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature . A long list could easily be given of “ sporting plants ; ” by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset , which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant . Such buds can be propagated by grafting , etc. , and sometimes by seed . These “ sports ” are extremely rare under nature , but far from rare under cultivation ; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has affected a bud or offset , and not the ovules or pollen . But it is the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation ; so that , in fact , “ sports ” support my view , that variability may be largely attributed to the ovules or pollen , or to both , having been affected by the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception . These cases anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected , as some authors have supposed , with the act of generation . Seedlings from the same fruit , and the young of the same litter , sometimes differ considerably from each other , though both the young and the parents , as Müller has remarked , have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life ; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction , and of growth , and of inheritance ; for had the action of the conditions been direct , if any of the young had varied , all would probably have varied in the same manner . To judge how much , in the case of any variation , we should attribute to the direct action of heat , moisture , light , food , etc. , is most difficult : my impression is , that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect , though apparently more in the case of plants . Under this point of view , Mr. Buckman ’ s recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable . When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way , the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions ; but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure . Nevertheless some slight amount of change may , I think , be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life—as , in some cases , increased size from amount of food , colour from particular kinds of food and from light , and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate . Habit also has a decided influence , as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another . In animals it has a more marked effect ; for instance , I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more",On The Origin Of Species1ed
Bram Stoker,". And amongst them Leonard , in a picturesque suit , lolling back just as at present and smiling with a loving look in his eyes as she handed him a great blue-and-white Munich beer mug topped with cool foam . There was a soft mystery in her voice as she answered : 'Perhaps , Leonard , there will some day be such a place here ! ' He seemed to grumble as he replied : ' I wish it was here now . Some day seems a long way off ! ' This seemed a good opening for Stephen ; for the fear of the situation was again beginning to assail her , and she felt that if she did not enter on her task at once , its difficulty might overwhelm her . She felt angry with herself that there was a change in her voice as she said : 'Some day may mean -- can mean everything . Things need n't be a longer way off than we choose ourselves , sometimes ! ' ' I say , that 's a good one ! Do you mean to say that because I am some day to own Brindehow I can do as I like with it at once , whilst the governor 's all there , and a better life than I am any day ? Unless you want me to shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the First . ' He laughed a short , unmeaning masculine laugh which jarred somewhat on her . She did not , however , mean to be diverted from her main purpose , so she went on quickly : 'You know quite well , Leonard , that I do n't mean anything of the kind . But there was something I wanted to say to you , and I wished that we should be alone . Can you not guess what it is ? ' 'No , I 'll be hanged if I can ! ' was his response , lazily given . Despite her resolution she turned her head ; she could not meet his eyes . It cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she turned again that he was not looking at her . He continued fanning himself with his hat as he gazed out at the view . She felt that the critical moment of her life had come , that it was now or never as to her fulfilling her settled intention . So with a rush she went on her way : 'Leonard , you and I have been friends a long time . You know my views on some points , and that I think a woman should be as free to act as a man ! ' She paused ; words and ideas did not seem to flow with the readiness she expected . Leonard 's arrogant assurance completed the dragging her back to earth which her own self-consciousness began : 'Drive on , old girl ! I know you 're a crank from Crankville on some subjects . Let us have it for all you 're worth . I 'm on the grass and listening . ' Stephen paused . ' A crank from Crankville ! ' -- this after her nights of sleepless anxiety ; after the making of the resolution which had cost her so much , and which was now actually in process of realisation . Was it all worth so much ? why not abandon it now ? . . . Abandon it ! Abandon a resolution ! All the obstinacy of her nature -- she classed it herself as firmness -- rose in revolt . She shook her head angrily , pulled herself together , and went on : 'That may be ! though it 's not what I call myself , or what I am usually called , so far as I know . At any rate my convictions are honest , and I am sure you will respect them as such , even if you do not share them . ' She did not see the ready response in his face which she expected , and so hurried on : 'It has always seemed to me that a -- when a woman has to speak to a man she should do so as frankly as she would like him to speak to her , and as freely . Leonard , I -- I , ' as she halted , a sudden idea , winged with possibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her . She went on more easily : ' I know you are in trouble about money matters . Why not let me help you ? ' He sat up and looked at her and said genially : 'Well , Stephen , you are a good old sort ! No mistake about it . Do you mean to say you would help me to pay my debts , when the governor has refused to do so any more ? ' 'It would be a great pleasure to me , Leonard , to do anything for your good or your pleasure . ' There was a long pause ; they both sat looking down at the ground . The woman 's heart beat loud ; she feared that the man must hear it . She was consumed with anxiety , and with a desolating wish to be relieved from the strain of saying more . Surely , surely Leonard could not be so blind as not to see the state of things ! . . . He would surely seize the occasion ; throw aside his diffidence and relieve her ! . . . His words made a momentary music in her ears as he spoke : 'And is this what you asked me to come here for ? ' The words filled her with a great shame . She felt herself a dilemma . It had been no part of her purpose to allude his debts . Viewed in the light of what was to follow , it would seem to him that she was trying to foreclose his affection . That could not be allowed to pass ; the error must be rectified . And yet ! . . . And yet this very error must be cleared up before she could make her full wish apparent . She seemed to find herself compelled by inexorable circumstances into an unlooked-for bluntness . In any case she must face the situation . Her pluck did not fail her ; it was with a very noble and graceful simplicity that she turned to her companion and said : 'Leonard , I did not quite mean that . It would be a pleasure to me to be of that or any other service to you , if I might be so happy ! But I never meant to allude to your debts . Oh ! Leonard , ca n't you understand ! If you were my husband -- or -- or going to be , all such little troubles would fall away from you . But I would not for the world have you think . . . ' Her very voice failed her . She could not speak what was in her mind ; she turned away , hiding in her hands her face which fairly seemed to burn . This , she thought , was the time for a true lover 's opportunity ! Oh , if she had been a man , and a woman had so appealed , how he would have sprung to her side and taken her in his arms , and in a wild rapture of declared affection have swept away all the pain of her shame ! But she remained alone . There was no springing to her side ; no rapture of declared affection ; no obliteration of her shame . She had to bear it all alone . There , in the open ; under the eyes that she would fain have seen any other phase of her distress . Her heart beat loud and fast ; she waited to gain her self-control . Leonard Everard had his faults , plenty of them , and he was in truth composed of an amalgam of far baser metals than Stephen thought ; but he had been born of gentle blood and reared amongst gentlefolk . He did not quite understand the cause or the amount of his companion 's concern ; but he could not but recognise her distress . He realised that it had followed hard upon her most generous intention towards himself . He could not , therefore , do less than try to comfort her , and he began his task in a conventional way , but with a blundering awkwardness which was all manlike . He took her hand and held it in his ; this much at any rate he had learned in sitting on stairs or in conservatories after extra dances . He said as tenderly as he could , but with an impatient gesture unseen by her : 'Forgive me , Stephen ! I suppose I have said or done something which I should n't . But I do n't know what it is ; upon my honour I do n't . Anyhow , I am truly sorry for it . Cheer up , old girl ! I 'm not your husband , you know ; so you need n't be distressed . ' Stephen took her courage _a deux mains_ . If Leonard would not speak she must . It was manifestly impossible that the matter could be left in its present state . 'Leonard , ' she said softly and solemnly , 'might not that some day be ? ' Leonard , in addition to being an egotist and the very incarnation of selfishness , was a prig of the first water . He had been reared altogether in convention . Home life and Eton and Christchurch had taught him many things , wise as well as foolish ; but had tended to fix his conviction that affairs of the heart should proceed on adamantine lines of conventional decorum . It never even occurred to him that a lady could so far step from the confines of convention as to take the initiative in a matter of affection . In his blind ignorance he blundered brutally . He struck better than he knew , as , meaning only to pass safely by an awkward conversational corner , he replied : 'No jolly fear of that ! You 're too much of a boss for me ! ' The words and the levity with which they were spoken struck the girl as with a whip . She turned for an instant as pale as ashes ; then the red blood rushed from her heart , and face and neck were dyed crimson . It was not a blush , it was a suffusion . In his ignorance Leonard thought it was the former , and went on with what he considered his teasing . 'Oh yes ! You know you always want to engineer a chap your own way and make him do just as you wish . The man who has the happiness of marrying you , Stephen , will have a hard row to hoe ! ' His 'chaff ' with its utter want of refinement seemed to her , in her high-strung earnest condition , nothing short of brutal , and for a few seconds produced a feeling of repellence . But it is in the nature of things that opposition of any kind arouses the fighting instinct of a naturally dominant nature . She lost sight of her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose ; and as this was to win the man to her way of thinking , she took the logical course of answering his argument . If Leonard Everard had purposely set himself to stimulate her efforts in this direction he could hardly have chosen a better way . It came somewhat as a surprise to Stephen , when she heard her own words : ' I would make a good wife , Leonard ! A husband whom I loved and honoured would , I think , not be unhappy ! ' The sound of her own voice speaking these words , though the tone was low and tender and more self-suppressing by far than was her wont , seemed to peal like thunder in her own ears . Her last bolt seemed to have sped . The blood rushed to her head , and she had to hold on to the arms of the rustic chair or she would have fallen forward . The time seemed long before Leonard spoke again ; every second seemed an age . She seemed to have grown tired of waiting for the sound of his voice ; it was with a kind of surprise that she heard him say : 'You limit yourself wisely , Stephen ! ' 'How do you mean ? ' she asked , making a great effort to speak . 'You would promise to love and honour ; but there is n't anything about obeying . ' As he spoke Leonard stretched himself again luxuriously , and laughed with the intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied with a joke , however inferior , of his own manufacture . Stephen looked at him with a long look which began in anger -- that anger which comes from an unwonted sense of impotence , and ends in tolerance , the intermediate step being admiration . It is the primeval curse that a woman 's choice is to her husband ; and it is an important part of the teaching of a British gentlewoman , knit in the very fibres of her being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand years , that she be true to him . The man who has in his person the necessary powers or graces to evoke admiration in his wife , even for a passing moment , has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all the deadliest arts of mankind . Leonard Everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled at his ease on that summer morning . Tall , straight , supple ; a typical British gentleman of the educated class , with all parts of the body properly developed and held in some kind of suitable poise . As Stephen looked , the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her seemed to pass . She realised that here was a nature different from her own , and which should be dealt with in a way unsuitable to herself ; and the conviction seemed to make the action which it necessitated more easy as well as more natural to her . Perhaps for the first time in her life Stephen understood that it may be necessary to apply to individuals a standard of criticism unsuitable to self-judgment . Her recognition might have been summed up in the thought which ran through her mind : 'One must be a little lenient with a man one loves ! ' Stephen , when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to work within her , felt immediately its calming influence . It was with brighter thoughts and better humour that she went on with her task . A task only , it seemed now ; a means to an end which she desired . 'Leonard , tell me seriously , why do you think I gave you the trouble of coming out here ? ' 'Upon my soul , Stephen , I do n't know . ' 'You do n't seem to care either , lolling like that when I am serious ! ' The words were acid , but the tone was soft and friendly , familiar and genuine , putting quite a meaning of its own on them . Leonard looked at her indolently : ' I like to loll . ' 'But ca n't you even guess , or try to guess , what I ask you ? ' ' I ca n't guess . The day 's too hot , and that shanty with the drinks is not built yet . ' 'Or may never be ! ' Again he looked at her sleepily . 'Never be ! Why not ? ' 'Because , Leonard , it may depend on you . ' 'All right then . Drive on ! Hurry up the architect and the jerry-builder ! ' A quick blush leaped to Stephen 's cheeks . The words were full of meaning , though the tone lacked something ; but the news was too good . She could not accept it at once ; she decided to herself to wait a short time . Ere many seconds had passed she rejoiced that she had done so as he went on : ' I hope you 'll give me a say before that husband of yours comes along . He might be a blue-ribbonite ; and it would n't do to start such a shanty for rot-gut ! ' Again a cold wave swept over her . The absolute difference of feeling between the man and herself ; his levity against her earnestness , his callous blindness to her purpose , even the commonness of his words chilled her . For a few seconds she wavered again in her intention ; but once again his comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and took her back to her path . With chagrin she felt that her words almost stuck in her throat , as summoning up all her resolution she went on : 'It would be for you I would have it built , Leonard ! ' The man sat up quickly . 'For me ? ' he asked in a sort of wonderment . 'Yes , Leonard , for you and me ! ' She turned away ; her blushes so overcame her that she could not look at him . When she faced round again he was standing up , his back towards her . She stood up also . He was silent for a while ; so long that the silence became intolerable , and she spoke : 'Leonard , I am waiting ! ' He turned round and said slowly , the absence of all emotion from his face chilling her till her face blanched : ' I do n't think I would worry about it ! ' Stephen Norman was plucky , and when she was face to face with any difficulty she was all herself . Leonard did not look pleasant ; his face was hard and there was just a suspicion of anger . Strangely enough , this last made the next step easier to the girl ; she said slowly : 'All right ! I think I understand ! ' He turned from her and stood looking out on the distant prospect . Then she felt that the blow which she had all along secretly feared had fallen on her . But her pride as well as her obstinacy now rebelled . She would not accept a silent answer . There must be no doubt left to torture her afterwards . She would take care that there was no mistake . Schooling herself to her task , and pressing one hand for a moment to her side as though to repress the beating of her heart , she came behind him and touched him tenderly on the arm . 'Leonard , ' she said softly , 'are you sure there is no mistake ? Do you not see that I am asking you , ' she intended to say 'to be my husband , ' but she could not utter the words , they seemed to stick in her mouth , so she finished the sentence : 'that I be your wife ? ' The moment the words were spoken -- the bare , hard , naked , shameless words -- the revulsion came . As a lightning flash shows up the blackness of the night the appalling truth of what she had done was forced upon her . The blood rushed to her head till cheeks and shoulders and neck seemed to burn . Covering her face with her hands she sank back on the seat crying silently bitter tears that seemed to scald her eyes and her cheeks as they ran . Leonard was angry . When it began to dawn upon him what was the purpose of Stephen 's speech , he had been shocked . Young men are so easily shocked by breaches of convention made by women they respect ! And his pride was hurt . Why should he have been placed in such a ridiculous position ! He did not love Stephen in that way ; and she should have known it . He liked her and all that sort of thing ; but what right had she to assume that he loved her ? All the weakness of his moral nature came out in his petulance . It was boyish that his eyes filled with tears . He knew it , and that made him more angry than ever . Stephen might well have been at a loss to understand his anger , as , with manifest intention to wound , he answered her : 'What a girl you are , Stephen . You are always doing something or other to put a chap in the wrong and make him ridiculous . I thought you were joking -- not a good joke either ! Upon my soul , I do n't know what I've done that you should fix on me ! I wish to goodness -- ' If Stephen had suffered the red terror before , she suffered the white terror now . It was not injured pride , it was not humiliation , it was not fear ; it was something vague and terrible that lay far deeper than any of these . Under ordinary circumstances she would have liked to have spoken out her mind and given back as good as she got ; and even as the thoughts whirled through her brain they came in a torrent of vague vituperative eloquence . But now her tongue was tied . Instinctively she knew that she had put it out of her power to revenge , or even to defend herself . She was tied to the stake , and must suffer without effort and in silence . Most humiliating of all was the thought that she must propitiate the man who had so wounded her . All love for him had in the instant passed from her ; or rather she realised fully the blank , bare truth that she had never really loved him at all . Had she really loved him , even a blow at his hands would have been acceptable ; but now . . . She shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does the water from its wings ; and , with the courage and strength and adaptability of her nature , addressed herself to the hard task which faced her in the immediate present . With eloquent , womanly gesture she arrested the torrent of Leonard 's indignation ; and , as he paused in surprised obedience , she said : 'That will do , Leonard ! It is not necessary to say any more ; and I am sure you will see , later on , that at least there was no cause for your indignation ! I have done an unconventional thing , I know ; and I dare say I shall have to pay for it in humiliating bitterness of thought later on ! But please remember we are all alone ! This is a secret between us ; no one else need ever know or suspect it ! ' She rose as she concluded . The quiet dignity of her speech and bearing brought back Leonard in some way to his sense of duty as a gentleman . He began , in a sheepish way , to make an apology : ' I 'm sure I beg your pardon , Stephen . ' But again she held the warning hand : 'There is no need for pardon ; the fault , if there were any , was mine alone . It was I , remember , who asked you to come here and who introduced and conducted this melancholy business . I have asked you several things , Leonard , and one more I will add -- 't is only one : that you will forget ! ' As she moved away , her dismissal of the subject was that of an empress to a serf . Leonard would have liked to answer her ; to have given vent to his indignation that , even when he had refused her offer , she should have the power to treat him if he was the one refused , and to make him feel small and ridiculous in his own eyes . But somehow he felt constrained to silence ; her simple dignity outclassed him . There was another factor too , in his forming his conclusion of silence . He had never seen Stephen look so well , or so attractive . He had never respected her so much as when her playfulness had turned to majestic gravity . All the boy and girl strife of the years that had gone seemed to have passed away . The girl whom he had played with , and bullied , and treated as frankly as though she had been a boy , had in an instant become a woman -- and such a woman as demanded respect and admiration even from such a man . CHAPTER XII -- ON THE ROAD HOME When Leonard Everard parted from Stephen he did so with a feeling of dissatisfaction : firstly , with Stephen ; secondly , with things in general ; thirdly , with himself . The first was definite , concrete , and immediate ; he could give himself chapter and verse for all the girl 's misdoing . Everything she had said or done had touched some nerve painfully , or had offended his feelings ; and to a man of his temperament his feelings are very sacred things , to himself . 'Why had she put him in such a ridiculous position ? That was the worst of women . They were always wanting him to do something he did n't want to do , or crying . . . there was that girl at Oxford . ' Here he turned his head slowly , and looked round in a furtive way , which was getting almost a habit with him . ' A fellow should go away so that he would n't have to swear lies . Women were always wanting money ; or worse : to be married ! Confound women ; they all seemed to want him to marry them ! There was the Oxford girl , and then the Spaniard , and now Stephen ! ' This put his thoughts in a new channel . He wanted money himself . Why , Stephen had spoken of it herself ; had offered to pay his debts . Gad ! it was a good idea that every one round the countryside seemed to know his affairs . What a flat he had been not to accept her offer then and there before matters had gone further . Stephen had lots of money , more than any girl could want . But she did n't give him time to get the thing fixed . . . If he had only known beforehand what she wanted he could have come prepared . . . that was the way with women ! Always thinking of themselves ! And now ? Of course she would n't stump up after his refusing her . What would his father say if he came to hear of it ? And he must speak to him soon , for these chaps were threatening to County Court him if he did n't pay . Those harpies in Vere Street were quite nasty . . . ' He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan . He walked on through the woodland path , his pace slower than before . 'How pretty she had looked ! ' Here he touched his little moustache . 'Gad ! Stephen was a fine girl anyhow ! If it was n't for all that red hair . . . I like 'em dark better ! . . . And her being such an infernal boss ! ' . . . Then he said unconsciously aloud : 'If I was her husband I 'd keep her to rights ! ' Poor Stephen ! 'So that 's what the governor meant by telling me that fortune was to be had , and had easily , if a man was n't a blind fool . The governor is a starchy old party . He would n't speak out straight and say , `` Here's Stephen Norman , the richest girl you are ever likely to meet ; why don't you make up to her and marry her ? '' But that would be encouraging his son to be a fortune-hunter ! Rot ! . . . And now , just because she did n't tell me what she wanted to speak about , or the governor did n't give me a hint so that I might be prepared , I have gone and thrown away the chance . After all it might n't be so bad . Stephen is a fine girl ! . . . But she must n't ever look at me as she did when I spoke about her not obeying . I mean to be master in my own house anyhow ! ' A man must n't be tied down too tight , even if he is married . And if there 's plenty of loose cash about it is n't hard to cover up your tracks . . . I think I 'd better think this thing over calmly and be ready when Stephen comes at me again . That 's the way with women . When a woman like Stephen fixes her cold grey on a man she does not mean to go asleep over it . I daresay my best plan will be to sit tight , and let her work herself up a bit . There 's nothing like a little wholesome neglect for bringing a girl to her bearings ! ' . . . For a while he walked on in satisfied self-complacency . 'Confound her ! why could n't she have let me know that she was fond of me in some decent way , without all that formal theatrical proposing ? It 's a deuced annoying thing in the long run the way the women get fond of me . Though it 's nice enough in some ways while it lasts ! ' he added , as if in unwilling recognition of fact . As the path debouched on the highroad he said to himself half aloud : 'Well , she 's a mighty fine girl , anyhow ! And if she is red I 've had about enough of the black ! . . . That Spanish girl is beginning to kick too ! I wish I had never come across . . . ' 'Shut up , you fool ! ' he said to himself as he walked on . When he got home he found a letter from his father . He took it to his room before breaking the seal . It was at least concise and to the point : 'The enclosed has been sent to me . You will have to deal with it yourself . You know my opinion and also my intention . The items which I have marked have been incurred since I spoke to you last about your debts . I shall not pay another farthing for you . So take your own course ! 'JASPER EVERARD . ' The enclosed was a jeweller 's bill , the length and the total of which lengthened his face and drew from him a low whistle . He held it in his hand for a long time , standing quite still and silent . Then drawing a deep breath he said aloud : 'That settles it ! The halter is on me ! It 's no use squealing . If it's to be a red head on my pillow ! . . . All right ! I must only make the best of it . Anyhow I 'll have a good time to-day , even if it must be the last ! ' That day Harold was in Norcester on business . It was late when he went to the club to dine . Whilst waiting for dinner he met Leonard Everard , flushed and somewhat at uncertain in his speech . It was something of a shock to Harold to see him in such a state . Leonard was , however , an old friend , and man is as a rule faithful to friends in this form of distress . So in his kindly feeling Harold offered to drive him home , for he knew that he could thus keep him out of further harm . Leonard thanked him in uncertain speech , and said he would be ready . In the meantime he would go and play billiards with the marker whilst Harold was having his dinner . At ten o'clock Harold 's dogcart was ready and he went to look for Leonard , who had not since come near him . He found him half asleep in the smoking-room , much drunker than he had been earlier in the evening . The drive was fairly long , so Harold made up his mind for a prolonged term of uneasiness and anxiety . The cool night-air , whose effect was increased by the rapid motion , soon increased Leonard 's somnolence and for a while he slept soundly , his companion watching carefully lest he should sway over and fall out of the trap . He even held him up as they swung round sharp corners . After a time he woke up , and woke in a nasty temper . He began to find fault in an incoherent way with everything . Harold said little , just enough to prevent any cause for further grievance . Then Leonard changed and became affectionate . This mood was a greater bore than the other , but Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference . Leonard was this by time making promises to do things for him , that as he was what he called a 'goo ' fell ' , ' he might count on his help and support in the future . As Harold knew him to be a wastrel , over head and ears in debt and with only the succession to a small estate , he did not take much heed to his maunderings . At last the drunken man said something which startled him so much that he instinctively drew himself together with such suddenness as to frighten the horse and almost make him rear up straight . 'Woa ! Woa ! Steady , boy . Gently ! ' he said , quieting him . Then turning to his companion said in a voice hollow with emotion and vibrant with suppressed passion : 'What was it you said ? ' Leonard , half awake , and not half of that half master of himself , answered : ' I said I will make you agent of Normanstand when I marry Stephen . ' Harold grew cold . To hear of any one marrying Stephen was to him like plunging him in a glacier stream ; but to hear her name so lightly spoken , and by such a man , was a bewildering shock which within a second set his blood on fire . 'What do you mean ? ' he thundered . 'You marry Ste . . . Miss Norman ! You 're not worthy to untie her shoe ! You indeed ! She would n't look on the same side of the street with a drunken brute like you ! How dare you speak of her in such a way ! ' 'Brute ! ' said Leonard angrily , his vanity reaching inward to heart and brain through all the numbing obstacle of his drunken flesh . 'Who's brute ? Brute yourself ! Tell you goin ' to marry Stephen , 'cos Stephen wants it . Stephen loves me . Loves me with all her red head ! Wha 're you doin ' ! Wha ! ! ' His words merged in a lessening gurgle , for Harold had now got him by the throat . 'Take care what you say about that lady ! damn you ! ' he said , putting his face close the other 's with eyes that blazed . 'Do n't you dare to mention her name in such a way , or you will regret it longer than you can think . Loves you , you swine ! ' The struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered Leonard somewhat . Momentarily sobbed him to that point when he could be coherent and vindictive , though not to the point where he could think ahead . Caution , wisdom , discretion , taste , were not for him at such a moment . Guarding his throat with both hands in an instinctive and spasmodic manner he answered the challenge : 'Who are you calling swine ? I tell you she loves me . She ought to know . Did n't she tell me so this very day ! ' Harold drew back his arm to strike him in the face , his anger too great for words . But the other , seeing the motion and in the sobering recognition of danger , spoke hastily : 'Keep your hair on ! You know so jolly much more than I do . I tell you that she told me this and a lot more this morning when she asked me to marry her . ' Harold 's heart grew cold as ice . There is something in the sound of a voice speaking truthfully which a true man can recognise . Through all Leonard 's half-drunken utterings came such a ring of truth ; and Harold recognised it . He felt that his voice was weak and hollow as he spoke , thinking it necessary to give at first a sort of official denial to such a monstrous statement : 'Liar ! ' ' I 'm no liar ! ' answered Leonard . He would like to have struck him in answer to such a word had he felt equal to it . 'She asked me to marry her to-day on the hill above the house , where I went to meet her by appointment . Here ! I 'll prove it to you . Read this ! ' Whilst he was speaking he had opened the greatcoat and was fumbling in the breast-pocket of his coat . He produced a letter which he handed to Harold , who took it with trembling hand . By this time the reins had fallen slack and the horse was walking quietly . There was moonlight , but not enough to read by . Harold bent over and lifted the driving-lamp next to him and turned it so that he could read the envelope . He could hardly keep either lamp or paper still , his hand trembled so when he saw that the direction was in Stephen 's handwriting . He was handing it back when Leonard said again : 'Open it ! Read it ! You must do so ; I tell you , you must ! You called me a liar , and now must read the proof that I am not . If you do n't I shall have to ask Stephen to make you ! ' Before Harold 's mind flashed a rapid thought of what the girl might suffer in being asked to take part in such a quarrel . He could not himself even act to the best advantage unless he knew the truth . . . he took the letter from the envelope and held it before the lamp , the paper fluttering as though in a breeze from the trembling of his hand . Leonard looked on , the dull glare of his eyes brightening with malignant pleasure as he beheld the other 's concern . He owed him a grudge , and by God he would pay it . Had he not been struck -- throttled -- called a liar ! . . . As he read the words Harold 's face cleared . 'Why , you infernal young scoundrel ! ' he said angrily , 'that letter is nothing but a simple note from a young girl to an old friend -- playmate asking him to come to see her about some trivial thing . And you construe it into a proposal of marriage . You hound ! ' He held the letter whilst he spoke , heedless of the outstretched hand of the other waiting to take it back . There was a dangerous glitter in Leonard 's eyes . He knew his man and he knew the truth of what he had himself said , and he felt , with all the strength of his base soul , how best he could torture him . In the very strength of Harold 's anger , in the poignancy of his concern , in the relief to his soul expressed in his eyes and his voice , his antagonist realised the jealousy of one who honours -- and loves . Second by second Leonard grew more sober , and more and better able to carry his own idea into act . 'Give me my letter ! ' he began . 'Wait ! ' said Harold as he put the lamp back into its socket . 'That will do presently . Take back what you said just now ! ' 'What ? Take back what ? ' 'That base lie ; that Miss Norman asked you to marry her . ' Leonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of the letter he would be outmatched ; but his passion grew colder and more malignant , and in a voice that cut like the hiss of a snake he spoke slowly and deliberately . He was all sober now ; the drunkenness of brain and blood was lost , for the time , in the strength of his cold passion . 'It is true . By God it is true ; every word of it ! That letter , which you want to steal , is only a proof that I went to meet her on Caester Hill by her own appointment . When I got there , she was waiting for me . She began to talk about a chalet there , and at first I did n't know what she meant -- ' There was such conviction , such a triumphant truth in his voice , that Harold was convinced . 'Stop ! ' he thundered ; 'stop , do n't tell me anything . I do n't want to hear . I do n't want to know . ' He covered his face with his hands and groaned . It was not as though the speaker were a stranger , in which case he would have been by now well on in his death by strangulation ; he had known Leonard all his life , and he was a friend of Stephen 's . And he was speaking truth . The baleful glitter of Leonard 's eyes grew brighter still . He was as a serpent when he goes to strike . In this wise he struck . ' I shall not stop . I shall go on and tell you all I choose . You have called me liar -- twice . You have also called me other names . Now you shall hear the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . And if you wo n't listen to me some one else will . ' Harold groaned again ; Leonard 's eyes brightened still more , and the evil smile on his face grew broader as he began more and more to feel his power . He went on to speak with a cold deliberate malignancy , but instinctively so sticking to absolute truth that he could trust himself to hurt most . The other listened , cold at heart and physically ; his veins and arteries seemed stagnant . ' I wo n't tell you anything of her pretty embarrassments ; how her voice fell as she pleaded ; how she blushed and stammered . Why , even I , who am used to women and their pretty ways and their passions and their flushings and their stormy upbraidings , did n't quite know for a while what she was driving at . So at last she spoke out pretty plainly , and told me what a fond wife she 'd make me if I would only take her ! ' Harold said nothing ; he only rocked a little as one in pain , and his hands fell . The other went on : 'That is what happened this morning on Caester Hill under the trees where I met Stephen Norman by her own appointment ; honestly what happened . If you do n't believe me now you can ask Stephen . My Stephen ! ' he added in a final burst of venom as in a gleam of moonlight through a rift in the shadowy wood he saw the ghastly pallor of Harold 's face . Then he added abruptly as he held out his hand : 'Now give me my letter ! ' In the last few seconds Harold had been thinking . And as he had been thinking for the good , the safety , of Stephen , his thoughts flew swift and true . This man 's very tone , the openness of his malignity , the underlying scorn when he spoke of her whom others worshipped , showed him the danger -- the terrible immediate danger in which she stood from such a man . With the instinct of a mind working as truly for the woman he loved as the needle does to the Pole he spoke quietly , throwing a sneer into the tone so as to exasperate his companion -- it was brain against brain now , and for Stephen 's sake : 'And of course you accepted . You naturally would ! ' The other fell into the trap . He could not help giving an extra dig to his opponent by proving him once more in the wrong . 'Oh no , I did n't ! Stephen is a fine girl ; but she wants taking down a bit . She 's too high and mighty just at present , and wants to boss a chap too much . I mean to be master in my own house ; and she 's got to begin as she will have to go on . I 'll let her wait a bit : and then I 'll yield by degrees to her lovemaking . She 's a fine girl , for all her red head ; and she wo n't be so bad after all ! ' Harold listened , chilled into still and silent amazement . To hear Stephen spoken of in such a way appalled him . She of all women ! . . . Leonard never knew how near sudden death he was , as he lay back in his seat , his eyes getting dull again and his chin sinking . The drunkenness which had been arrested by his passion was reasserting itself . Harold saw his state in time and arrested his own movement to take him by the throat and dash him to the ground . Even as he looked at him in scornful hate , the cart gave a lurch and Leonard fell forward . Instinctively Harold swept an arm round him and held him up . As he did so the unconsciousness of arrested sleep came ; Leonard 's chin sank on his breast and he breathed stertorously . As he drove on , Harold 's thoughts circled in a tumult . Vague ideas of extreme measures which he ought to take flashed up and paled away . Intention revolved upon itself till its weak side was exposed , and , it was abandoned . He could not doubt the essential truth of Leonard's statement regarding the proposal of marriage . He did not understand this nor did he try to . His own love for the girl and the bitter awaking to its futility made him so hopeless that in his own desolation all the mystery of her doing and the cause of it was merged and lost . His only aim and purpose now was her safety . One thing at least he could do : by fair means or foul stop Leonard 's mouth , so that others need not know her shame ! He groaned aloud as the thought came to him . Beyond this first step he could do nothing , think of nothing as yet . And he could not take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he could understand . And so waiting for that time to come , he drove on through the silent night . CHAPTER XIII -- HAROLD 'S RESOLVE As they went on their way Harold noticed that Leonard 's breathing became more regular , as in honest sleep . He therefore drove slowly so that the other might be sane again before they should arrive at the gate of his father 's place ; he had something of importance to say before they should part . Seeing him sleeping so peacefully , Harold passed a strap round him to prevent him falling from his seat . Then he could let his thoughts run more freely . Her safety was his immediate concern ; again and again he thought over what he should say to Leonard to ensure his silence . Whilst he was pondering with set brows , he was startled by Leonard's voice at his side : 'Is that you , Harold ? I must have been asleep ! ' Harold remained silent , amazed at the change . Leonard went on , quite awake and coherent : 'By George ! I must have been pretty well cut . I do n't remember a thing after coming down the stairs of the club and you and the hall-porter helping me up here . I say , old chap , you have strapped me up all safe and tight . It was good of you to take charge of me . I hope I haven't been a beastly nuisance ! ' Harold answered grimly : 'It was n't exactly what I should have called it ! ' Then , after looking keenly at his companion , he said : 'Are you quite awake and sober now ? ' 'Quite . ' The answer came defiantly ; there was something in his questioner 's tone which was militant and aggressive . Before speaking further Harold pulled up the horse . They were now crossing bare moorland , where anything within a mile could have easily been seen . They were quite alone , and would be undisturbed . Then he turned to his companion . 'You talked a good deal in your drunken sleep -- if sleep it was . You appeared to be awake ! ' Leonard answered : ' I do n't remember anything of it . What did I say ? ' ' I am going to tell you . You said something so strange and so wrong that you must answer for it . But first I must know its truth . ' 'Must ! You are pretty dictatorial , ' said Leonard angrily . 'Must answer for it ! What do you mean ? ' 'Were you on Caester Hill to-day ? ' 'What 's that to you ? ' There was no mistaking the defiant , quarrelsome intent . 'Answer me ! were you ? ' Harold 's voice was strong and calm . 'What if I was ? It is none of your affair . Did I say anything in what you have politely called my drunken sleep ? ' 'You did . ' 'What did I say ? ' ' I shall tell you in time . But I must know the truth as I proceed . There is some one else concerned in this , and I must know as I go on . You can easily judge by what I say if I am right . ' 'Then ask away and be damned to you ! ' Harold 's calm voice seemed to quell the other 's turbulence as he went on : 'Were you on Caester Hill this morning ? ' ' I was . ' 'Did you meet Miss -- - a lady there ? ' 'What . . . I did ! ' 'Was it by appointment ? ' Some sort of idea or half-recollection seemed to come to Leonard ; he fumbled half consciously in his breast-pocket . Then he broke out angrily : 'You have taken my letter ! ' ' I know the answer to that question , ' said Harold slowly . 'You showed me the letter yourself , and insisted on my reading it . ' Leonard 's heart began to quail . He seemed to have an instinctive dread of what was coming . Harold went on calmly and remorselessly : 'Did a proposal of marriage pass between you ? ' 'Yes ! ' The answer was defiantly given ; Leonard began to feel that his back was against the wall . 'Who made it ? ' The answer was a sudden attempt at a blow , but Harold struck down his hand in time and held it . Leonard , though a fairly strong man , was powerless in that iron grasp . 'You must answer ! It is necessary that I know the truth . ' 'Why must you ? What have you to do with it ? You are not my keeper ! Nor Stephen 's ; though I dare say you would like to be ! ' The insult cooled Harold 's rising passion , even whilst it wrung his heart . ' I have to do with it because I choose . You may find the answer if you wish in your last insult ! Now , clearly understand me , Leonard Everard . You know me of old ; and you know that what I say I shall do . One way or another , your life or mine may hang on your answers to me -- if necessary ! ' Leonard felt himself pulled up . He knew well the strength and purpose of the man . With a light laugh , which he felt to be , as it was , hollow , he answered : 'Well , schoolmaster , as you are asking questions , I suppose I may as well answer them . Go on ! Next ! ' Harold went on in the same calm , cold voice : 'Who made the proposal of marriage ? ' 'She did . ' 'Did . . . Was it made at once and directly , or after some preliminary suggestion ? ' 'After a bit . I did n't quite understand at first what she was driving at . ' There was a long pause . With an effort Harold went on : 'Did you accept ? ' Leonard hesitated . With a really wicked scowl he eyed his big , powerfully-built companion , who still had his hand as in a vice . Then seeing no resource , he answered : ' I did not ! That does not mean that I wo n't , though ! ' he added defiantly . To his surprise Harold suddenly released his hand . There was a grimness in his tone as he said : 'That will do ! I know now that you have spoken the truth , sober as well as drunk . You need say no more . I know the rest . Most men -- even brutes like you , if there are any -- would have been ashamed even to think the things you said , said openly to me , you hound . You vile , traitorous , mean-souled hound ! ' 'What did I say ? ' ' I know what you said ; and I shall not forget it . ' He went on , his voice deepening into a stern judicial utterance , as though he were pronouncing a sentence of death : 'Leonard Everard , you have treated vilely a lady whom I love and honour more than I love my own soul . You have insulted her to her face and behind her back . You have made such disloyal reference to her and to her mad act in so trusting you , and have so shown your intention of causing , intentionally or unintentionally , woe to her , that I tell you here and now that you hold henceforth your life in your hand . If you ever mention to a living soul what you have told me twice to-night , even though you should be then her husband ; if you should cause her harm though she should then be your wife ; if you should cause her dishonour in public or in private , I shall kill you . So help me God ! ' Not a word more did he say ; but , taking up the reins , drove on in silence till they arrived at the gate of Brindehow , where he signed to him to alight . He drove off in silence . When he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed , and then went to his study , where he locked himself in . Then , and then only , did he permit his thoughts to have full range . For the first time since the blow had fallen he looked straight in the face the change in his own life . He had loved Stephen so long and so honestly that it seemed to him now as if that love had been the very foundation of his life . He could not remember a time when he had not loved her ; away back to the time when he , a big boy , took her , a little girl , under his care , and devoted himself to her . He had grown into the belief that so strong and so consistent an affection , though he had never spoken it or even hinted at it or inferred it , had become a part of her life as well as of his own . And this was the end of that dreaming ! Not only did she not care for him , but found herself with a heart so empty that she needs must propose marriage to another man ! There was surely something , more than at present he knew of or could understand , behind such an act done by her . Why should she ask Everard to marry her ? Why should she ask any man ? Women did n't do such things ! . . . Here he paused . 'Women did n't do such things . ' All at once there came back to him fragments of discussions -- in which Stephen had had a part , in which matters of convention had been dealt with . Out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to his heart , though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it . He knew that Stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality of the sexes . Was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her theories ? The idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet . He stood up , and walked the room . Somehow he felt light beginning to dawn , though he could not tell its source , or guess at the final measure of its fulness . The fact of Stephen having done such a thing was hard to bear ; but it was harder to think that she should have done such a thing without a motive ; or worse : with love of Leonard as a motive ! He shuddered as he paused . She could not love such a man . It was monstrous ! And yet she had done this thing . . . 'Oh , if she had had any one to advise her , to restrain her ! But she had no mother ! No mother ! Poor Stephen ! ' The pity of it , not for himself but for the woman he loved , overcame him . Sitting down heavily before his desk , he put his face on his hands , and his great shoulders shook . Long , long after the violence of his emotion had passed , he sat there motionless , thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew ; thinking for Stephen 's good . When a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it . He may blunder ; but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the main right . So it was with Harold . He knew that he was ignorant of women , and of woman 's nature , as distinguished from man 's . The only woman he had ever known well was Stephen ; and she in her youth and in her ignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to supply to him data for his present needs . To a clean-minded man of his age a woman is something divine . It is only when in later life disappointment and experience have hammered bitter truth into his brain , that he begins to realise that woman is not angelic but human . When he knows more , and finds that she is like himself , human and limited but with qualities of purity and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame , he realises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be the vague , unreal creations of his dreams . And then he can thank God for His goodness that when He might have given us Angels He did give us women ! Of one thing , despite the seeming of facts , he was sure : Stephen did not love Leonard . Every fibre of his being revolted at the thought . She of so high a nature ; he of so low . She so noble ; he so mean . Bah ! the belief was impossible . Impossible ! Herein was the manifestation of his ignorance ; anything is possible where love is concerned ! It was characteristic of the man that in his mind he had abandoned , for the present at all events , his own pain . He still loved Stephen with all the strength of his nature , but for him the selfish side ceased to exist . He was trying to serve Stephen ; and every other thought had to give way . He had been satisfied that in a manner she loved him in some way and in some degree ; and he had hoped that in the fulness of time the childish love would ripen , so that in the end would come a mutual affection which was of the very essence of Heaven . He believed still that she loved him in some way ; but the future that was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing hand . She had actually proposed marriage to another man . If the idea of a marriage with him had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt of her feeling toward another . . . . And yet ? And yet he could not believe that she loved Leonard ; not even if all trains of reasoning should end by leading to that point . One thing he had at present to accept , that whatever might be the measure of affection Stephen might have for him , it was not love as he understood it . He resolutely turned his back on the thought of his own side of the matter , and tried to find some justification of Stephen 's act . 'Seek and ye shall find ; knock and it shall be opened to ye ' has perhaps a general as well as a special significance . It is by patient tireless seeking that many a precious thing has been found . It was after many a long cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual result . Harold came to believe , vaguely at first but more definitely as the evidence nucleated , that Stephen 's act was due to some mad girlish wish to test her own theory ; to prove to herself the correctness of her own reasoning , the fixity of her own purpose . He did not go on analysing further ; for as he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken from his heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken . The day would soon be upon him , and there was work to be done . Instinctively he knew that there was trouble in store for Stephen , and he felt that in such an hour he should be near her . All her life she had been accustomed to him . In her sorrows to confide in him , to tell him her troubles so that they might dwindle and pass away ; to enhance her pleasures by making him a sharer in them . Harold was inspirited by the coming of the new day . There was work to be done , and the work must be based on thought . His thoughts must take a practical turn ; what was he to do that would help Stephen ? Here there dawned on him for the first time the understanding of a certain humiliation which she had suffered ; she had been refused ! She who had stepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she had always walked as to propose marriage to a man , had been refused ! He did not , could not , know to the full the measure of such humiliation to a woman ; but he could guess at any rate a part . And that guessing made him grind his teeth in impotent rage . But out of that rage came an inspiration . If Stephen had been humiliated by the refusal of one man , might not this be minimised if she in turn might refuse another ? Harold knew so well the sincerity of his own love and the depth of his own devotion that he was satisfied that he could not err in giving the girl the opportunity of refusing him . It would be some sort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that Leonard 's views were not shared by all men . That there were others who would deem it a joy to serve as her slaves . When she had refused him she would perhaps feel easier in her mind . Of course if she did not refuse him . . . Ah ! well , then would the gates of Heaven open . . . But that would never be . The past could not be blotted out ! All he could do would be to serve her . He would go early . Such a man as Leonard Everard might make some new complication , and the present was quite bad enough . It was a poor enough thing for him , he thought at length . She might trample on him ; but it was for her sake . And to him what did it matter ? The worst had come . All was over now ! CHAPTER XIV -- THE BEECH GROVE On the morning following the proposal Stephen strolled out into a beech grove , some little distance from the house , which from childhood had been a favourite haunt of hers . It was not in the immediate road to anywhere , and so there was no occasion for any of the household or the garden to go through it or near it . She did not put on a hat , but took only a sunshade , which she used in passing over the lawn . The grove was on the side of the house away from her own room and the breakfast-room . When she had reached its shade she felt that at last she was alone . The grove was a privileged place . Long ago a great number of young beeches had been planted so thickly that as they grew they shot up straight and branchless in their struggle for the light . Not till they had reached a considerable altitude had they been thinned ; and then the thinning had been so effected that , as the high branches began to shoot out in the freer space , they met in time and interlaced so closely that they made in many places a perfect screen of leafy shade . Here and there were rifts or openings through which the light passed ; under such places the grass was fine and green , or the wild hyacinths in due season tinged the earth with blue . Through the grove some wide alleys had been left : great broad walks where the soft grass grew short and fine , and to whose edges came a drooping of branches and an upspringing of undergrowth of laurel and rhododendron . At the far ends of these walks were little pavilions of marble built in the classic style which ruled for garden use two hundred years ago . At the near ends some of them were close to the broad stretch of water from whose edges ran back the great sloping banks of emerald sward dotted here and there with great forest trees . The grove was protected by a ha-ha , so that it was never invaded from without , and the servants of the house , both the domestics and the gardeners and grooms , had been always forbidden to enter it . Thus by long usage it had become a place of quiet and solitude for the members of the family . To this soothing spot had come Stephen in her pain . The long spell of self-restraint during that morning had almost driven her to frenzy , and she sought solitude as an anodyne to her tortured soul . The long anguish of a third sleepless night , following on a day of humiliation and terror , had destroyed for a time the natural resilience of a healthy nature . She had been for so long in the prison of her own purpose with Fear as warder ; the fetters of conventional life had so galled her that here in the accustomed solitude of this place , in which from childhood she had been used to move and think freely , she felt as does a captive who has escaped from an irksome durance . As Stephen had all along been free of movement and speech , no such opportunities of freedom called to her . The pent-up passion in her , however , found its own relief . Her voice was silent , and she moved with slow steps , halting often between the green tree-trunks in the cool shade ; but her thoughts ran free , and passion found a vent . No stranger seeing the tall , queenly girl moving slowly through the trees could have imagined the fierce passion which blazed within her , unless he had been close enough to see her eyes . The habit of physical restraint to which all her life she had been accustomed , and which was intensified by the experience of the past thirty-six hours , still ruled her , even here . Gradually the habit of security began to prevail , and the shackles to melt away . Here had she come in all her childish troubles . Here had she fought with herself , and conquered herself . Here the spirits of the place were with her and not against her . Here memory in its second degree , habit , gave her the full sense of spiritual freedom . As she walked to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its objective : from restraint to its final causes ; and chief amongst them the pride which had been so grievously hurt . How she loathed the day that had passed , and how more than all she hated herself for her part in it ; her mad , foolish , idiotic , self-importance which gave her the idea of such an act and urged her to the bitter end of its carrying out ; her mulish obstinacy in persisting when every fibre of her being had revolted at the doing , and when deep in her inmost soul was a deterring sense of its futility . How could she have stooped to have done such a thing : to ask a man . . . oh ! the shame of it , the shame of it all ! How could she have been so blind as to think that such a man was worthy ! . . . In the midst of her whirlwind of passion came a solitary gleam of relief : she knew with certainty that she did not love Leonard ; that she had never loved him . The coldness of disdain to him , the fear of his future acts which was based on disbelief of the existence of that finer nature with which she had credited him , all proved to her convincingly that he could never really have been within the charmed circle of her inner life . Did she but know it , there was an even stronger evidence of her indifference to him in the ready manner in which her thoughts flew past him in their circling sweep . For a moment she saw him as the centre of a host of besetting fears ; but her own sense of superior power nullified the force of the vision . She was able to cope with him and his doings , were there such need . And so her mind flew back to the personal side of her trouble : her blindness , her folly , her shame . In truth she was doing good work for herself . Her mind was working truly and to a beneficent end . One by one she was overcoming the false issues of her passion and drifting to an end in which she would see herself face to face and would place so truly the blame for what had been as to make it a warning and ennobling lesson of her life . She moved more quickly , passing to and fro as does a panther in its cage when the desire of forest freedom is heavy upon it . That which makes the irony of life will perhaps never be understood in its casual aspect by the finite mind of man . The 'why ' and 'wherefore' and the 'how ' of it is only to be understood by that All-wise intelligence which can scan the future as well as the present , and see the far far-reaching ramifications of those schemes of final development to which the manifestation of completed character tend . To any mortal it would seem a pity that to Stephen in her solitude , when her passion was working itself out to an end which might be good , should come an interruption which would throw it back upon itself in such a way as to multiply its malignant force . But again it is a part of the Great Plan that instruments whose use man 's finite mind could never predicate should be employed : the seeming good to evil , the seeming evil to good . As she swept to and fro , her raging spirit compelling to violent movement , Stephen 's eyes were arrested by the figure of a man coming through the aisles of the grove . At such a time any interruption of her passion was a cause for heightening anger ; but the presence of a person was as a draught to a full-fed furnace . Most of all , in her present condition of mind , the presence of a man -- for the thought of a man lay behind all her trouble , was as a tornado striking a burning forest . The blood of her tortured heart seemed to leap to her brain and to suffuse her eyes . She 'saw blood ' ! It mattered not that the man whom she saw she knew and trusted . Indeed , this but added fuel to the flame . In the presence of a stranger some of her habitual self-restraint would doubtless have come back to her . But now the necessity for such was foregone ; Harold was her alter ego , and in his presence was safety . He was , in this aspect , but a higher and more intelligent rendering of the trees around her . In another aspect he was an opportune victim , something to strike at . When the anger of a poison snake opens its gland , and the fang is charged with venom , it must strike at something . It does not pause or consider what it may be ; it strikes , though it may be at stone or iron . So Stephen waited till her victim was within distance to strike . Her black eyes , fierce with passion and blood- rimmed as a cobra 's , glittered as he passed among the tree-trunks towards her , eager with his errand of devotion . Harold was a man of strong purpose . Had he not been , he would never have come on his present errand . Never , perhaps , had any suitor set forth on his quest with a heavier heart . All his life , since his very boyhood , had been centred round the girl whom to-day he had come to serve . All his thought had been for her : and to-day all he could expect was a gentle denial of all his hopes , so that his future life would be at best a blank . But he would be serving Stephen ! His pain might be to her good ; ought to be , to a certain extent , to her mental ease . Her wounded pride would find some solace . . . As he came closer the feeling that he had to play a part , veritably to act one , came stronger and stronger upon him , and filled him with bitter doubt as to his power . Still he went on boldly . It had been a part of his plan to seem to come eagerly , as a lover should come ; and so he came . When he got close to Stephen , all the witchery of her presence came upon him as of old . After all , he loved her with his whole soul ; and the chance had come to tell her so . Even under the distressing conditions of his suit , the effort had its charm . Stephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him ; and that , too , since the effort was based on truth came with a certain ease to her . At the present time , in her present frame of mind , nothing in the wide world could give her pleasure ; the ease which came , if it did not change her purpose , increased her power . Their usual salutation , begun when she was a little baby , was 'Good morning , Stephen ! ' 'Good morning , Harold ! ' It had become so much a custom that now it came mechanically on her part . The tender reference to childhood 's days , though it touched her companion to the quick , did not appeal to her since she had no special thought of it . Had such a thought come to her it might have softened her even to tears , for Harold had been always deep in her heart . As might have been expected from her character and condition of mind , she was the first to begin : ' I suppose you want to see me about something special , Harold , you have come so early . ' 'Yes , Stephen . Very special ! ' 'Were you at the house ? ' she asked in a voice whose quietness might have conveyed a warning . She was so suspicious now that she suspected even Harold of -- of what she did not know . He answered in all simplicity : 'No . I came straight here . ' 'How did you know I should be here ? ' Her voice was now not only quiet but sweet . Without thinking , Harold blundered on . His intention was so single-minded , and his ignorance of woman so complete , that he did not recognise even elementary truths : ' I knew you always came here long ago when you were a child when you were in -- ' Here it suddenly flashed upon him that if he seemed to expect that she was in trouble as he had purposed saying , he would give away his knowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work to which he had set himself . So he finished the sentence in a lame and impotent manner , which , however , saved complete annihilation as it was verbally accurate : 'in short frocks . ' Stephen needed to know little more . Her quick intelligence grasped the fact that there was some purpose afoot which she did not know or understand . She surmised , of course , that it was some way in connection with her mad act , and she grew cooler in her brain as well as colder in her heart as she prepared to learn more . Stephen had changed from girl to woman in the last twenty-four hours ; and all the woman in her was now awake . After a moment 's pause she said with a winning smile : 'Why , Harold , I 've been in long frocks for years . Why should I come here on this special day on that account ? ' Even as she was speaking she felt that it would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry . It had clearly told her all it could . She would learn more by some other means . So she went on in a playful way , as a cat -- not a kitten -- does when it has got a mouse : 'That reason wo n't work , Harold . It 's quite rusty in the joints . But never mind it ! Tell me why you have come so early ? ' This seemed to Harold to be a heaven-sent opening ; he rushed in at once : 'Because , Stephen , I wanted to ask you to be my wife ! Oh ! Stephen , don't you know that I love you ? Ever since you were a little girl ! When you were a little girl and I a big boy I loved you . I have loved you ever since with all my heart , and soul , and strength . Without you the world is a blank to me ! For you and your happiness I would do anything -- anything ! ' This was no acting . When once the barrier of beginning had been broken , his soul seemed to pour itself out . The man was vibrant through all his nature ; and the woman 's very soul realised its truth . For an instant a flame of gladness swept through her ; and for the time it lasted put all other thought aside . But suspicion is a hard metal which does not easily yield to fire . It can come to white heat easily enough , but its melting-point is high indeed . When the flame had leaped it had spent its force ; the reaction came quick . Stephen 's heart seemed to turn to ice , all the heat and life rushing to her brain . Her thoughts flashed with convincing quickness ; there was no time for doubting amid their rush . Her life was for good or ill at the crossing of the ways . She had trusted Harold thoroughly . The habit of her whole life from her babyhood up had been to so look to him as comrade and protector and sympathetic friend . She was so absolutely sure of his earnest devotion that this new experience of a riper feeling would have been a joy to her , if it should be that his act was all spontaneous and done in ignorance of her shame . 'Shame ' was the generic word which now summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in proposing to Leonard . But of this she must be certain . She could not , dare not , go farther till this was settled . With the same craving for certainty with which she convinced herself that Leonard understood her overtures , and with the same dogged courage with which she pressed the matter on him , she now went on to satisfy her mind . 'What did you do yesterday ? ' ' I was at Norcester all day . I went early . By the way , here is the ribbon you wanted ; I think it 's exactly the same as the pattern . ' As he spoke he took a tissue-piper parcel from his pocket and handed it to her . 'Thanks ! ' she said . 'Did you meet any friends there ? ' 'Not many . ' He answered guardedly ; he had a secret to keep . 'Where did you dine ? ' 'At the club ! ' He began to be uneasy at this questioning ; but he did not see any way to avoid answering without creating some suspicion . 'Did you see any one you knew at the club ? ' Her voice as she spoke was a little harder , a little more strained . Harold noticed the change , rather by instinct than reason . He felt that there was danger in it , and paused . The pause seemed to suddenly create a new fury in the breast of Stephen . She felt that Harold was playing with her . Harold ! If she could not trust him , where then was she to look for trust in the world ? If he was not frank with her , what then meant his early coming ; his seeking her in the grove ; his proposal of marriage , which seemed so sudden and so inopportune ? He must have seen Leonard , and by some means have become acquainted with her secret of shame . . . His motive ? Here her mind halted . She knew as well as if it had been trumpeted from the skies that Harold knew all . But she must be certain . . . Certain ! She was standing erect , her hands held down by her sides and clenched together till the knuckles were white ; all her body strung high -- like an over-pitched violin . Now she raised her right hand and flung it downward with a passionate jerk . 'Answer me ! ' she cried imperiously . 'Answer me ! Why are you playing with me ? Did you see Leonard Everard last night ? Answer me , I say . Harold An Wolf , you do not lie ! Answer me ! ' As she spoke Harold grew cold . From the question he now knew that Stephen had guessed his secret . The fat was in the fire with a vengeance . He did not know what to do , and still remained silent . She did not give him time to think , but spoke again , this time more coldly . The white terror had replaced the red : 'Are you not going to answer me a simple question , Harold ? To be silent now is to wrong me ! I have a right to know ! ' In his trouble , for he felt that say what he would he could only give her new pain , he said humbly : 'Do n't ask me , Stephen ! Wo n't you understand that I want to do what is best for you ? Wo n't you trust me ? ' Her answer came harshly . A more experienced man than Harold , one who knew women better , would have seen how overwrought she was , and would have made pity the pivot of his future bearing and acts and words while the interview lasted ; pity , and pity only . But to Harold the high ideal was ever the same . The Stephen whom he loved was no subject for pity , but for devotion only . He knew the nobility of her nature and must trust it to the end . When her silence and her blazing eyes denied his request , he answered her query in a low voice : ' I did ! ' Even whilst he spoke he was thankful for one thing , he had not been pledged in any way to confidence . Leonard had forced the knowledge on him ; and though he would have preferred a million times over to be silent , he was still free to speak . Stephen 's next question came more coldly still : 'Did he tell you of his meeting with me ? ' 'He did . ' 'Did he tell you all ? ' It was torture to him to answer ; but he was at the stake and must bear it . ' I think so ! If it was true . ' 'What did he tell you ? Stay ! I shall ask you the facts myself ; the broad facts . We need not go into details . . . ' 'Oh , Stephen ! ' She silenced his pleading with an imperious hand . 'If I can go into this matter , surely you can . If I can bear the shame of telling , you can at least bear that of listening . Remember that knowing -- knowing what you know , or at least what you have heard -- you could come here and propose marriage to me ! ' This she said with a cold , cutting sarcasm which sounded like the rasping of a roughly-sharpened knife through raw flesh . Harold groaned in spirit ; he felt a weakness which began at his heart to steal through him . It took all his manhood to bear himself erect . He dreaded what was coming , as of old the once- tortured victim dreaded the coming torment of the rack . CHAPTER XV -- THE END OF THE MEETING Stephen went on in her calm , cold voice : 'Did he tell you that I had asked him to marry me ? ' Despite herself , as she spoke the words a red tide dyed her face . It was not a flush ; it was not a blush ; it was a sort of flood which swept through her , leaving her in a few seconds whiter than before . Harold saw and understood . He could not speak ; he lowered his head silently . Her eyes glittered more coldly . The madness that every human being may have once was upon her . Such a madness is destructive , and here was something more vulnerable than herself . 'Did he tell you how I pressed him ? ' There was no red tide this time , nor ever again whilst the interview lasted . To bow in affirmation was insufficient ; with an effort he answered : ' I understood so . ' She answered with an icy sarcasm : 'You understood so ! Oh , I do n't doubt he embellished the record with some of his own pleasantries . But you understood it ; and that is sufficient . ' After a pause she went on : 'Did he tell you that he had refused me ? ' 'Yes ! ' Harold knew now that he was under the torture , and that there was no refusing . She went on , with a light laugh , which wrung his heart even more than her pain had done . . . Stephen to laugh like that ! 'And I have no doubt that he embellished that too , with some of his fine masculine witticisms . I understood myself that he was offended at my asking him . I understood it quite well ; he told me so ! ' Then with feminine intuition she went on : ' I dare say that before he was done he said something kindly of the poor little thing that loved him ; that loved him so much , and that she had to break down all the bounds of modesty and decorum that had made the women of her house honoured for a thousand years ! And you listened to him whilst he spoke ! Oh-h-h ! ' she quivered with her white-hot anger , as the fierce heat in the heart of a furnace quivers . But her voice was cold again as she went on : 'But who could help loving him ? Girls always did . It was such a beastly nuisance ! You `` understood '' all that , I dare say ; though perhaps he did not put it in such plain words ! ' Then the scorn , which up to now had been imprisoned , turned on him ; and he felt as though some hose of deathly chill was being played upon him . 'And yet you , knowing that only yesterday , he had refused me -- refused my pressing request that he should marry me , come to me hot-foot in the early morning and ask me to be your wife . I thought such things did not take place ; that men were more honourable , or more considerate , or more merciful ! Or at least I used to think so ; till yesterday . No ! till to- day . Yesterday 's doings were my own doings , and I had to bear the penalty of them myself . I had come here to fight out by myself the battle of my shame . . . ' Here Harold interrupted her . He could not bear to hear Stephen use such a word in connection with herself . 'No ! You must not say `` shame . '' There is no shame to you , Stephen . There can be none , and no one must say it in my presence ! ' In her secret heart of hearts she admired him for his words ; she felt them at the moment sink into her memory , and knew that she would never forget the mastery of his face and bearing . But the blindness of rage was upon her , and it is of the essence of this white-hot anger that it preys not on what is basest in us , but on what is best . That Harold felt deeply was her opportunity to wound him more deeply than before . 'Even here in the solitude which I had chosen as the battleground of my shame you had need to come unasked , unthought of , when even a lesser mind than yours , for you are no fool , would have thought to leave me alone . My shame was my own , I tell you ; and I was learning to take my punishment . My punishment ! Poor creatures that we are , we think our punishment will be what we would like best : to suffer in silence , and not to have spread abroad our shame ! ' How she harped on that word , though she knew that every time she uttered it , it cut to the heart of the man who loved her . 'And yet you come right on top of my torture to torture me still more and illimitably . You come , you who alone had the power to intrude yourself on my grief and sorrow ; power given you by my father 's kindness . You come to me without warning , considerately telling me that you knew I would be here because I had always come here when I had been in trouble . No -- I do you an injustice . `` In trouble '' was not what you said , but that I had come when I had been in short frocks . Short frocks ! And you came to tell me that you loved me . You thought , I suppose , that as I had refused one man , I would jump at the next that came along . I wanted a man . God ! God ! what have I done that such an affront should come upon me ? And come , too , from a hand that should have protected me if only in gratitude for my father 's kindness ! ' She was eyeing him keenly , with eyes that in her unflinching anger took in everything with the accuracy of sun-painting . She wanted to wound ; and she succeeded . But Harold had nerves and muscles of steel ; and when the call came to them they answered . Though the pain of death was upon him he did not flinch . He stood before her like a rock , in all his great manhood ; but a rock on whose summit the waves had cast the wealth of their foam , for his face was as white as snow . She saw and understood ; but in the madness upon her she went on trying new places and new ways to wound : 'You thought , I suppose , that this poor , neglected , despised , rejected woman , who wanted so much to marry that she could n't wait for a man to ask her , would hand herself over to the first chance comer who threw his handkerchief to her ; would hand over herself -- and her fortune ! ' 'Oh , Stephen ! How can you say such things , think such things ? ' The protest broke from him with a groan . His pain seemed to inflame her still further ; to gratify her hate , and to stimulate her mad passion : 'Why did I ever see you at all ? Why did my father treat you as a son ; that when you had grown and got strong on his kindness you could thus insult his daughter in the darkest hour of her pain and her shame ! ' She almost choked with passion . There was now nothing in the whole world that she could trust . In the pause he spoke : 'Stephen , I never meant you harm . Oh , do n't speak such wild words . They will come back to you with sorrow afterwards ! I only meant to do you good . I wanted . . . ' Her anger broke out afresh : 'There ; you speak it yourself ! You only wanted to do me good . I was so bad that any kind of a husband . . . Oh , get out of my sight ! I wish to God I had never seen you ! I hope to God I may never see you again ! Go ! Go ! Go ! ' This was the end ! To Harold 's honest mind such words would have been impossible had not thoughts of truth lain behind them . That Stephen -- his Stephen , whose image in his mind shut out every other woman in the world , past , present , and future -- should say such things to any one , that she should think such things , was to him a deadly blow . But that she should say them to him ! . . . Utterance , even the utterance which speaks in the inmost soul , failed him . He had in some way that he knew not hurt -- wounded -- killed Stephen ; for the finer part was gone from the Stephen that he had known and worshipped so long . She wished him gone ; she wished she had never seen him ; she hoped to God never to see him again . Life for him was over and done ! There could be no more happiness in the world ; no more wish to work , to live ! . . . He bowed gravely ; and without a word turned and walked away . Stephen saw him go , his tall form moving amongst the tree trunks till finally it was lost in their massing . She was so filled with the tumult of her passion that she looked , unmoved . Even the sense of his going did not change her mood . She raged to and fro amongst the trees , her movements getting quicker and quicker as her excitement began to change from mental to physical ; till the fury began to exhaust itself . All at once she stopped , as though arrested by a physical barrier ; and with a moan sank down in a helpless heap on the cool moss . * * * * * Harold went from the grove as one seems to move in a dream . Little things and big were mixed up in his mind . He took note , as he went towards the town by the byroads , of everything around him in his usual way , for he had always been one of those who notice unconsciously , or rather unintentionally . Long afterwards he could shut his eyes and recall every step of the way from the spot where he had turned from Stephen to the railway station outside Norcester . And on many and many such a time when he opened them again the eyelids were wet . He wanted to get away quickly , silently , unobserved . With the instinct of habitual thought his mind turned London-ward . He met but few persons , and those only cottiers . He saluted them in his usual cheery way , but did not stop to speak with any . He was about to take a single ticket to London when it struck him that this might look odd , so he asked for a return . Then , his mind being once more directed towards concealment of purpose , he sent a telegram to his housekeeper telling her that he was called away to London on business . It was only when he was far on his journey that he gave thought to ways and means , and took stock of his possessions . Before he took out his purse and pocket-book he made up his mind that he would be content with what it was , no matter how little . He had left Normanstand and all belonging to it for ever , and was off to hide himself in whatever part of the world would afford him the best opportunity . Life was over ! There was nothing to look forward to ; nothing to look back at ! The present was a living pain whose lightest element was despair . As , however , he got further and further away , his practical mind began to work ; he thought over matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he could dispose of his affairs , so to cause as little comment as might be , and to save the possibility of worry or distress of any kind to Stephen . Even then , in his agony of mind , his heart was with her ; it was not the least among his troubles that he would have to be away from her when perhaps she would need him most . And yet whenever he would come to this point in his endless chain of thought , he would have to stop for a while , overcome with such pain that his power of thinking was paralysed . He would never , could never , be of service to her again . He had gone out of her life , as she had gone out of his life ; though she never had , nor never could out of his thoughts . It was all over ! All the years of sweetness , of hope , and trust , and satisfied and justified faith in each other , had been wiped out by that last terrible , cruel meeting . Oh ! how could she have said such things to him ! How could she have thought them ! And there she was now in all the agony of her unrestrained passion . Well he knew , from his long experience of her nature , how she must have suffered to be in such a state of mind , to have so forgotten all the restraint of her teaching and her life ! Poor , poor Stephen ! Fatherless now as well as motherless ; and friendless as well as fatherless ! No one to calm her in the height of her wild abnormal passion ! No one to comfort her when the fit had passed ! No one to sympathise with her for all that she had suffered ! No one to help her to build new and better hopes out of the wreck of her mad ideas ! He would cheerfully have given his life for her . Only last night he was prepared to kill , which was worse than to die , for her sake . And now to be far away , unable to help , unable even to know how she fared . And behind her eternally the shadow of that worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted her to a chance comer in his drunken delirium . It was too bitter to bear . How could God lightly lay such a burden on his shoulders who had all his life tried to walk in sobriety and chastity and in all worthy and manly ways ! It was unfair ! It was unfair ! If he could do anything for her ? Anything ! Anything ! . . . And so the unending whirl of thoughts went on ! The smoke of London was dim on the horizon when he began to get back to practical matters . When the train drew up at Euston he stepped from it as one to whom death would be a joyous relief ! He went to a quiet hotel , and from there transacted by letter such business matters as were necessary to save pain and trouble to others . As for himself , he made up his mind that he would go to Alaska , which he took to be one of the best places in the as yet uncivilised world for a man to lose his identity . As a security at the start he changed his name ; and as John Robinson , which was not a name to attract public attention , he shipped as a passenger on the _Scoriac_ from London to New York . The _Scoriac_ was one of the great cargo boats which take a certain number of passengers . The few necessaries which he took with him were chosen with an eye to utility in that frozen land which he sought . For the rest , he knew nothing , nor did he care how or whither he went . His vague purpose was to cross the American Continent to San Francisco , and there to take passage for the high latitudes north of the Yukon River . * * * * * When Stephen began to regain consciousness her first sensation was one of numbness . She was cold in the back , and her feet did not seem to exist ; but her head was hot and pulsating as though her brain were a living thing . Then her half-open eyes began to take in her surroundings . For another long spell she began to wonder why all around her was green . Then came the inevitable process of reason . Trees ! It is a wood ! How did I come here ? why am I lying on the ground ? All at once wakened memory opened on her its flood-gates , and overwhelmed her with pain . With her hands pressed to her throbbing temples and her burning face close to the ground , she began to recall what she could of the immediate past . It all seemed like a terrible dream . By degrees her intelligence came back to its normal strength , and all at once , as does one suddenly wakened from sleep to the knowledge of danger , she sat up . Somehow the sense of time elapsed made Stephen look at her watch . It was half-past twelve . As she had come into the grove immediately after breakfast , and as Harold had almost immediately joined her , and as the interview between them had been but short , she must have lain on the ground for more than three hours . She rose at once , trembling in every limb . A new fear began to assail her ; that she had been missed at home , and that some one might have come to look for her . Up to now she had not been able to feel the full measure of pain regarding what had passed , but which would , she knew , come to her in the end . It was too vague as yet ; she could not realise that it had really been . But the fear of discovery was immediate , and must be guarded against without delay . As well as she could , she tidied herself and began to walk slowly back to the house , hoping to gain her own room unnoticed . That her general intelligence was awake was shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered that she had forgotten her sunshade . She went back and searched till she had found it . Gaining her room without meeting any one , she at once change her dress , fearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray her . Resolutely she put back from her mind all consideration of the past ; there would be time for that later on . Her nerves were already much quieter than they had been . That long faint , or lapse into insensibility , had for the time taken the place of sleep . There would be a price to be paid for it later ; but for the present it had served its purpose . Now and again she was disturbed by one thought ; she could not quite remember what had occurred after Harold had left , and just before she became unconscious . She dared not dwell upon it , however . It would doubtless all come back to her when she had leisure to think the whole matter over as a connected narrative . When the gong sounded for lunch she went down , with a calm exterior , to face the dreaded ordeal of another meal . Luncheon passed off without a hitch . She and her aunt talked as usual over all the small affairs of the house and the neighbourhood , and the calm restraint was in itself soothing . Even then she could not help feeling how much convention is to a woman 's life . Had it not been for these recurring trials of set hours and duties she could never have passed the last day and night without discovery of her condition of mind . That one terrible , hysterical outburst was perhaps the safety valve . Had it been spread over the time occupied in conventional duties its force even then might have betrayed her ; but without the necessity of nerving herself to conventional needs , she would have infallibly betrayed herself by her negative condition . After lunch she went to her own boudoir where , when she had shut the inner door , no one was allowed to disturb her without some special need in the house or on the arrival of visitors . This 'sporting oak ' was the sign of 'not at home ' which she had learned in her glimpse of college life . Here in the solitude of safety , she began to go over the past , resolutely and systematically . She had already been so often over the memory of the previous humiliating and unhappy day that she need not revert to it at present . Since then had she not quarrelled with Harold , whom she had all her life so trusted that her quarrel with him seemed to shake the very foundations of her existence ? As yet she had not remembered perfectly all that had gone on under the shadow of the beech grove . She dared not face it all at once , even as yet . Time must elapse before she should dare to cry ; to think of her loss of Harold was to risk breaking down altogether . Already she felt weak . The strain of the last forty-eight hours was too much for her physical strength . She began to feel , as she lay back in her cushioned chair , that a swoon is no worthy substitute for sleep . Indeed it had seemed to make the need for sleep even more imperative . It was all too humiliating ! She wanted to think over what had been ; to recall it as far as possible so as to fix it in her mind , whilst it was still fresh . Later on , some action might have to be based on her recollection . And yet . . . How could she think when she was so tired . . . tired . . . Nature came to the poor girl 's relief at last , and she fell into a heavy sleep . . . It was like coming out of the grave to be dragged back to waking life out of such a sleep , and so soon after it had begun . But the voice seemed to reach to her inner consciousness in some compelling way . For a second she could not understand ; but as she rose from the cushions the maid's message repeated , brought her wide awake and alert in an instant : 'Mr . Everard , young Mr. Everard , to see you , miss ! ' CHAPTER XVI -- A PRIVATE CONVERSATION The name braced Stephen at once . Here was danger , an enemy to be encountered ; all the fighting blood of generations leaped to the occasion . The short spell of sleep had helped to restore her . There remained still quite enough of mental and nervous excitement to make her think quickly ; the words were hardly out of the maid 's mouth before her resolution was taken . It would never do to let Leonard Everard see she was diffident about meeting him ; she would go down at once . But she would take the precaution of having her aunt present ; at any rate , till she should have seen how the land lay . Her being just waked from sleep would be an excuse for asking her aunt to see the visitor till she came down . So she said to the maid : ' I have been asleep . I must have got tired walking in the wood in the heat . Ask Auntie to kindly see Mr. Everard in the blue drawing-room till I come down . I must tidy my hair ; but I will be down in a few minutes . ' 'Shall I send Marjorie to you , miss ? ' 'No ! Do n't mind ; I can do what I want myself . Hurry down to Miss Rowly ! ' How she regarded Leonard Everard now was shown in her instinctive classing him amongst her enemies . When she entered the room she seemed all aglow . She wanted not only to overcome but to punish ; and all the woman in her had risen to the effort . Never in her life had Stephen Norman looked more radiantly beautiful , more adorable , more desirable . Even Leonard Everard felt his pulses quicken as he saw that glowing mass of beauty standing out against the cold background of old French tapestry . All the physical side of him leaped in answer to the call of her beauty ; and even his cold heart and his self-engrossed brain followed with slower gait . He had been sitting opposite Miss Rowly in one of the windows , twirling his hat in nervous suspense . He jumped up , and , as she came towards him , went forward rapidly to greet her . No one could mistake the admiration in his eyes . Ever since he had made up his mind to marry her she had assumed a new aspect in his thoughts . But now her presence swept away all false imaginings ; from the moment that her loveliness dawned upon him something like love began to grow within his breast . Stephen saw the look and it strengthened her . He had so grievously wounded her pride the previous day that her victory on this was a compensation which set her more at her old poise . Her greeting was all sweetness : she was charmed to see him . How was his father , and what was the news ? Miss Rowly looked on with smiling visage . She too had seen the look of admiration in his eyes , and it pleased her . Old ladies , especially when they are maiden ladies , always like to see admiration in the eyes of young men when they are turned in the direction of any girl dear to them . They talked for some time , keeping all the while , by Stephen 's clever generalship , to the small-talk of the neighbourhood and the minor events of social importance . As the time wore on she could see that Leonard was growing impatient , and evidently wanted to see her alone . She ignored , however , all his little private signalling , and presently ordered tea to be brought . This took some little time ; when it had been brought and served and drunk , Leonard was in a smothered fume of impatience . She was glad to see that as yet her aunt had noticed nothing , and she still hoped that she would be able to so prolong matters , that she would escape without a private interview . She did not know the cause of Leonard's impatience : that he must see her before the day passed . She too was an egoist , in her own way ; in the flush of belief of his subjugation she did not think of attributing to him any other motive than his desire for herself . As she had made up her mind on the final issue she did not want to be troubled by a new 'scene . ' But , after all , Leonard was a man ; and man 's ways are more direct than woman 's . Seeing that he could not achieve his object in any other way , he said out suddenly , thinking , and rightly , that she would not wish to force an issue in the presence of her aunt : 'By the way , Miss Norman , ' he had always called her 'Miss Norman ' in her aunt 's presence : ' I want to have two minutes with you before I go . On a matter of business , ' he added , noticing Miss Rowly 's surprised look . The old lady was old-fashioned even for her age ; in her time no young man would have asked to see a young lady alone on business . Except on one kind of business ; and with regard to that kind of business gentlemen had to obtain first the confidence and permission of guardians . Leonard saw the difficulty and said quickly : 'It is on the matter you wrote to me about ! ' Stephen was prepared for a nasty shock , but hardly for so nasty a one as this . There was an indelicacy about it which went far beyond the bounds of thoughtless conventionality . That such an appeal should be made to her , and in such a way , savoured of danger . Her woman 's intuition gave her the guard , and at once she spoke , smilingly and gently as one recalling a matter in which the concern is not her own : 'Of course ! It was selfish of me not to have thought of it , and to have kept you so long waiting . The fact is , Auntie , that Leonard -- I like to call him Leonard , since we were children together , and he is so young ; though perhaps it would be more decorous nowadays to say `` Mr. Everard '' -- has consulted me about his debts . You know , Auntie dear , that young men will be young men in such matters ; or perhaps you do not , since the only person who ever worried you has been myself . But I stayed at Oxford and I know something of young men 's ways ; and as I am necessarily more or less of a man of business , he values my help . Do n't you , Leonard ? ' The challenge was so direct , and the position he was in so daringly put , that he had to acquiesce . Miss Rowly , who had looked on with a frown of displeasure , said coldly : ' I know you are your own mistress , my dear . But surely it would be better if Mr. Everard would consult with his solicitor or his father's agent , or some of his gentlemen friends , rather than with a young lady whose relations with him , after all , are only those of a neighbour on visiting terms . For my own part , I should have thought that Mr. Everard 's best course would have been to consult his own father ! But the things that gentlemen , as well as ladies do , have been sadly changed since my time ! ' Then , rising in formal dignity , she bowed gravely to the visitor before leaving the room . But the position of being left alone in the room with Leonard did not at all suit Stephen 's plans . Rising quickly she said to her aunt : 'Do n't stir , Auntie . I dare say you are right in what you say ; but I promised Mr. Everard to go into the matter . And as I have brought the awkwardness on myself , I suppose I must bear it . If Mr. Everard wants to see me alone , and I suppose he is diffident in speaking on such a matter before you -- he did n't play with you , you know ! -- we can go out on the lawn . We sha n't be long ! ' Before Leonard could recover his wits she had headed him out on the lawn . Her strategy was again thoroughly good . The spot she chose , though beyond earshot , was quite in the open and commanded by all the windows in that side of the house . A person speaking there might say what he liked , but his actions must be discreet . On the lawn Stephen tripped ahead ; Leonard followed inwardly raging . By her clever use of the opening she had put him in a difficulty from which there was no immediate means of extrication . He could not quarrel overtly with Stephen ; if he did so , how could he enter on the pressing matter of his debts ? He dared not openly proclaim his object in wishing to marry her , for had he done so her aunt might have interfered , with what success he could not be sure . In any case it would cause delay , and delay was what he could not afford . He felt that in mentioning his debts at just such a movement he had given Stephen the chance she had so aptly taken . He had to be on his good behaviour , however ; and with an apprehension that was new to him he followed her . An old Roman marble seat was placed at an angle from the house so that the one of the two occupants within its curve must almost face the house , whilst the other gave to it at least a quarter-face . Stephen seated herself on the near side , leaving to Leonard the exposed position . As soon as he was seated , she began : 'Now , Leonard , tell me all about the debts ? ' She spoke in tones of gay friendliness , but behind the mask of her cheerfulness was the real face of fear . Down deep in her mind was a conviction that her letter was a pivotal point of future sorrow . It was in the meantime quite apparent to her that Leonard kept it as his last resource ; so her instinct was to keep it to the front and thus minimise its power . Leonard , though inwardly weakened by qualms of growing doubt , had the animal instinct that , as he was in opposition , his safety was in attacking where his opponent most feared . He felt that there was some subtle change in his companion ; this was never the same Stephen Norman whom only yesterday he had met upon the hill ! He plunged at once into his purpose . 'But it was n't about my debts you asked me to meet you , Stephen . ' 'You surprise me , Leonard ! I thought I simply asked you to come to meet me . I know the first subject I mentioned when we began to talk , after your grumbling about coming in the heat , was your money matters . ' Leonard winced , but went on : 'It was very good of you , Stephen ; but really that is not what I came to speak of to-day . At first , at all events ! ' he added with a sublime naivette , as the subject of his debts and his imperative want of money rose before him . Stephen 's eyes flashed ; she saw more clearly than ever through his purpose . Such as admission at the very outset of the proffer of marriage , which she felt was coming , was little short of monstrous . Her companion did not see the look of mastery on her face ; he was looking down at the moment . A true lover would have been looking up . ' I wanted to tell you , Stephen , that I have been thinking over what you said to me in your letter , and what you said in words ; and I want to accept ! ' As he was speaking he was looking her straight in the face . Stephen answered slowly with a puzzled smile which wrinkled up her forehead : 'Accept what I said in my letter ! why , Leonard , what do you mean ? That letter must have had a lot more in it than I thought . I seem to remember that it was simply a line asking you to meet me . Just let me look at it ; I should like to be sure of what actually is ! ' As she spoke she held out her hand . Leonard was nonplussed ; he did not know what to say . Stephen made up her mind to have the letter back . Leonard was chafing under the position forced upon him , and tried to divert his companion from her purpose . He knew well why she had chosen that exposed position for their interview . Now , as her outstretched hand embarrassed him , he made reprisal ; he tried to take it in his in a tender manner . She instantly drew back her hand and put it behind her in a decided manner . She was determined that whatever might happen she would not let any watcher at the windows , by chance or otherwise , see any sign of tenderness on her part . Leonard , thinking that his purpose had been effected , went on , breathing more freely : 'Your letter was n't much . Except of course that it gave me the opportunity of listening to what you said ; to all your sweet words . To your more than sweet proposal ! ' 'Yes ! It must have been sweet to have any one , who was in a position to do so , offer to help you when you knew that you were overwhelmed with debts ! ' The words were brutal . Stephen felt so ; but she had no alternative . Leonard had some of the hard side of human nature ; but he had also some of the weak side . He went on blindly : ' I have been thinking ever since of what you said , and I want to tell you that I would like to do as you wish ! ' As he spoke , his words seemed even to him to be out of place . He felt it would be necessary to throw more fervour into the proceedings . The sudden outburst which followed actually amused Stephen , even in her state of fear : 'Oh , Stephen , do n't you know that I love you ! You are so beautiful ! I love you ! I love you ! Wo n't you be my wife ? ' This was getting too much to close quarters . Stephen said in a calm , business-like way : 'My dear Leonard , one thing at a time ! I came out here , you know , to speak of your debts ; and until that is done , I really wo n't go into any other matter . Of course if you 'd rather not . . . ' Leonard really could not afford this ; matters were too pressing with him . So he tried to affect a cheery manner ; but in his heart was a black resolve that she should yet pay for this . 'All right ! Stephen . Whatever you wish I will do ; you are the queen of my heart , you know ! ' 'How much is the total amount ? ' said Stephen . This was a change to the prosaic which made sentiment impossible . He gave over , for the time . 'Go on ! ' said Stephen , following up her advantage . 'Do n't you even know how much you owe ? ' 'The fact is , I do n't . Not exactly . I shall make up the amount as well as I can and let you know . But that 's not what I came about to-day . ' Stephen was going to make an angry gesture of dissent . She was not going to have that matter opened up . She waited , however , for Leonard was going on after his momentary pause . She breathed more freely after his first sentence . He was unable evidently to carry on a double train of thought . 'It was about that infernal money-lenders ' letter that the Governor got ! ' Stephen got still less anxious . This open acknowledgment of his true purpose seemed to clear the air . 'What is the amount ? ' Leonard looked quickly at her ; the relief of her mind made her tone seem joyful . ' A monkey ! Five hundred pounds , you know . But then there 's three hundred for interest that has to be paid also . It 's an awful lot of money , is n't it ? ' The last phrase was added on seeing Stephen's surprised look . 'Yes ! ' she answered quietly . ' A great deal of money -- to waste ! ' They were both silent for a while . Then she said : 'What does your father say to it ? ' 'He was in an awful wax . One of these beastly duns had written to him about another account and he was in a regular fury . When I told him I would pay it within a week , he said very little , which was suspicious ; and then , just when I was going out , he sprung this on me . Mean of him ! was n't it ? I need expect no help from him . ' As he was speaking he took a mass of letters from his pocket and began to look among them for the money-lenders ' letter . 'Why , what a correspondence you have there . Do you keep all your letters in your pockets ? ' said Stephen quietly . 'All I do n't tear up or burn . It would n't do to let the Governor into my secrets . He might know too much ! ' 'And are all those letters from duns ? ' 'Mostly , but I only keep those letters I have to attend to and those I care for . ' 'Show me the bundle ! ' she said . Then seeing him hesitate , added : 'You know if I am to help you to get clear you must take me into your confidence . I dare say I shall have to see a lot more letters than these before you are quite clear ! ' Her tone was too quiet . Knowing already the silent antagonism between them he began to suspect her ; knowing also that her own letter was not amongst them , he used his wits and handed them over without a word . She , too , suspected him . After his tacit refusal to give her the letter , she almost took it for granted that it was not amongst them . She gave no evidence of her feeling , however , but opened and read the letters in due sequence ; all save two , which , being in a female hand , she gave back without a word . There was a calmness and an utter absence of concern , much less of jealousy , about this which disconcerted him . Throughout her reading Stephen 's face showed surprise now and again ; but when she came to the last , which was that of the usurers , it showed alarm . Being a woman , a legal threat had certain fears of its own . 'There must be no delay about this ! ' she said . 'What am I to do ? ' he answered , a weight off his mind that the fiscal matter had been practically entered on . ' I shall see that you get the money ! ' she said quietly . 'It will be really a gift , but I prefer it to be as a loan for many reasons . ' Leonard made no comment . He found so many reasons in his own mind that he thought it wise to forbear from asking any of hers . Then she took the practical matter in hand : 'You must wire to these people at once to say that you will pay the amount on the day after to-morrow . If you will come here to-morrow at four o'clock the money will be ready for you . You can go up to town by the evening train and pay off the debt first thing in the morning . When you bring the receipt I shall speak to you about the other debts ; but you must make out a full list of them . We ca n't have any half-measure . I will not go into the matter till I have all the details before me ! ' Then she stood up to go . As they walked across the lawn , she said : 'By the way , do n't forget to bring that letter with you . I want to see what I really did say in it ! ' Her tone was quiet enough , and the wording was a request ; but Leonard knew as well as if it had been spoken outright as a threat that if he did not have the letter with him when he came things were likely to be unpleasant . The farther he got from Normanstand on his way home the more discontented Leonard grew . Whilst he had been in Stephen 's presence she had so dominated him , not only by her personality but by her use of her knowledge of his own circumstances , that he had not dared to make protest or opposition ; but now he began to feel how much less he was to receive than he had expected . He had come prepared to allow Stephen to fall into his arms , fortune and all . But now , although he had practical assurance that the weight of his debts would be taken from him , he was going away with his tail between his legs . He had not even been accepted as a suitor , he who had himself been wooed only a day before . His proposal of marriage had not been accepted , had not even been considered by the woman who had so lately broken ironclad convention to propose marriage to him . He had been treated merely as a scapegrace debtor who had come to ask favours from an old friend . He had even been treated like a bad boy ; had been told that he had wasted money ; had been ordered , in no doubtful way , to bring the full schedule of his debts . And all the time he dared not say anything lest the thing should n't come off at all . Stephen had such an infernally masterly way with her ! It did n't matter whether she was proposing to him , or he was proposing to her , he was made to feel small all the same . He would have to put up with it till he had got rid of the debts ! And then as to the letter . Why was she so persistent about seeing it ? Did she want to get it into her hands and then keep it , as Harold An Wolf had done ? Was it possible that she suspected he would use it to coerce her ; she would call it 'blackmail , ' he supposed . This being the very thing he had intended to do , and had done , he grew very indignant at the very thought of being accused of it . It was , he felt , a very awkward thing that he had lost possession of the letter . He might need it if Stephen got nasty . Then Harold might give it to her , as he had threatened to do . He thought he would call round that evening by Harold 's house , and see if he could n't get back the letter . It belonged to him ; Harold had no right to keep it . He would see him before he and Stephen got putting their heads together . So , on his way home , he turned his steps at once to Harold 's house . He did not find him in . The maid who opened the door could give him no information ; all she could say was that Mrs. Dingle the housekeeper had got a telegram from Master saying that he had been called suddenly away on business . This was a new source of concern to Leonard . He suspected a motive of some sort ; though what that motive could be he could not hazard the wildest guess . On his way home he called at the post-office and sent a telegram to Cavendish and Cecil , the name of the usurers ' firm , in accordance with Stephen 's direction . He signed it : 'Jasper Everard . ' CHAPTER XVII -- A BUSINESS TRANSACTION When Stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out for a stroll ; she knew it would be no use trying to get rest before dinner . That ordeal , too , had to be gone through . She found herself unconsciously going in the direction of the grove ; but when she became aware of it a great revulsion overcame her , and she shuddered . Slowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finely-kept grass which lay on the side of the house away from the wood . The green sward lay like a sea , dotted with huge trees , singly , or in clumps as islands . In its far-stretching stateliness there was something soothing . She came back to the sound of the dressing-gong with a better strength to resist the trial before her . Well she knew her aunt would have something to say on the subject of her interference in Leonard Everard 's affairs . Her fears were justified , for when they had come into the drawing-room after dinner Miss Rowly began : 'Stephen dear , is it not unwise of you to interfere in Mr. Everard's affairs ? ' 'Why unwise , Auntie ? ' 'Well , my dear , the world is censorious . And when a young lady , of your position and your wealth , takes a part in a young man 's affairs tongues are apt to wag . And also , dear , debts , young men 's debts , are hardly the subjects for a girl 's investigation . Remember , that we ladies live very different lives from men ; from some men , I should say , for your dear father was the best of men , and I should think that in all his life there was nothing which he would have wished concealed . But , my dear , young men are less restrained in their ways than we are , than we have to be for our own safety and protection . ' The poor lady was greatly perturbed at having to speak in such a way . Stephen saw her distress ; coming over to her , she sat down and took her hand . Stephen had a very tender side to her nature , and she loved very truly the dear old lady who had taken her mother 's place and had shown her all a mother 's love . Now , in her loneliness and woe and fear , she clung to her in spirit . She would have liked to have clung to her physically ; to have laid her head on her bosom , and have cried her heart out . The time for tears had not come . Hourly she felt more and more the weight that a shameful secret is to carry . She knew , however , that she could set her aunt 's mind at rest on the present subject ; so she said : ' I think you are right , Auntie dear . It would have been better if I had asked you first ; but I saw that Leonard was in distress , and wormed the cause of it from him . When I heard that it was only debt I offered to help him . He is an old friend , you know , Auntie . We were children together ; and as I have much more money than I can ever want or spend , I thought I might help him . I am afraid I have let myself in for a bigger thing than I intended ; but as I have promised I must go on with it . I dare say , Auntie , that you are afraid that I may end by getting in love with him , and marrying him . Do n't you , dear ? ' This was said with a hug and a kiss which gave the old lady delight . Her instinct told her what was coming . She nodded her head in acquiescence . Stephen went on gravely : 'Put any such fear out of your mind . I shall never marry him . I can never love him . ' She was going to say 'could never love him , ' when she remembered . 'Are you sure , my dear ? The heart is not always under one 's own control . ' 'Quite sure , Auntie . I know Leonard Everard ; and though I have always liked him , I do not respect him . Why , the very fact of his coming to me for money would make me reconsider any view I had formed , had nothing else ever done so . You may take it , Auntie dear , that in the way you mean Leonard is nothing to me ; can never be anything to me ! ' Here a sudden inspiration took her . In its light a serious difficulty passed , and the doing of a thing which had a fear of its own became easy . With a conviction in her tone , which in itself aided her immediate purpose , she said : ' I shall prove it to you . That is , if you will not mind doing something which will save me an embarrassment . ' 'You know I will do anything , my dearest , which an old woman can do for a young one ! ' Stephen squeezed the mittened hand which she held as she went on : 'As I said , I have promised to lend him some money . The first instalment is to be given him to-morrow ; he is to call for it in the afternoon . Will you give it to him for me ? ' 'Gladly , my dear , ' said the old lady , much relieved . Stephen continued : 'One other thing , Auntie , I want you to do for me : not to think of the amount , or to say a word to me about it . It is a large sum , and I dare say it will frighten you a little . But I have made up my mind to it . I am learning a great deal out of this , Auntie dear ; and I am quite willing to pay for my knowledge . After all , money is the easiest and cheapest way of paying for knowledge ! Do n't you agree with me ? ' Miss Rowly gulped down her disappointment . She felt that she ought not to say too much , now that Stephen had set aside her graver fears . She consoled herself with the thought that even a large amount of money would cause no inconvenience to so wealthy a woman as Stephen . Beyond this , as she would have the handing over of the money to Leonard , she would know the amount . If advisable , she could remonstrate . She could if necessary consult , in confidence , with Harold . Her relief from her greater fear , and her gladness at this new proof of her niece 's confidence , were manifested in the extra affection with which she bade her good-night . Stephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite alone ; and as she lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought before sleep came . Her first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate danger was swerving from her . Things were so shaping themselves that she need not have any fear concerning Leonard . For his own sake he would have to keep silent . If he intended to blackmail her she would have the protection of her aunt 's knowledge of the loan , and of her participation in it . The only weapon that remained to him was her letter ; and that she would get from him before furnishing the money for the payment of his other debts . These things out of the way , her thoughts turned to the matter of the greater dread ; that of which all along she had feared to think for a moment : Harold ! Harold ! and her treatment of him ! The first reception of the idea was positive anguish . From the moment he had left her till now there had been no time when a consideration of the matter was possible . Time pressed , or circumstances had interfered , or her own personal condition had forbidden . Now , when she was alone , the whole awful truth burst on her like an avalanche . Stephen felt the issue of her thinking before the thinking itself was accomplished ; and it was with a smothered groan that she , in the darkness , held up her arms with fingers linked in desperate concentration of appeal . Oh , if she could only take back one hour of her life , well she knew what that hour would be ! Even that shameful time with Leonard on the hill-top seemed innocuous beside the degrading remembrance of her conduct to the noble friend of her whole life . Sadly she turned over in her bed , and with shut eyes put her burning face on the pillow , to hide , as it were , from herself her abject depth of shame . Leonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he could . At four o'clock he was at the door of Normanstand in his dogcart . This time he had a groom with him and a suitcase packed for a night 's use , as he was to go on to London after his interview with Stephen . He had lost sight altogether of the matter of Stephen 's letter , or else he would have been more nervous . He was taken into the blue drawing-room , where shortly Miss Rowly joined him . He had not expected this . His mental uneasiness manifested itself in his manner , and his fidgeting was not unobserved by the astute old lady . He was disconcerted ; 'overwhelmed ' would better have described his feelings when she said : 'Miss Norman is sorry she ca n't see you to-day as she is making a visit ; but she has given me a message for you , or rather a commission to discharge . Perhaps you had better sit down at the table ; there are writing materials there , and I shall want a receipt of some sort . ' 'Stephen did not say anything about a receipt ! ' The other smiled sweetly as she said in a calm way : 'But unfortunately Miss Norman is not here ; and so I have to do the best I can . I really must have some proof that I have fulfilled my trust . You see , Mr. Everard , though it is what lawyers call a `` friendly '' transaction , it is more or less a business act ; and I must protect myself . ' Leonard saw that he must comply , for time pressed . He sat down at the table . Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him , he said with what command of his voice he could : 'What am I to write ? ' The old lady took from her basket a folded sheet of notepaper , and , putting on her reading-glasses , said as she smoothed it out : ' I think it would be well to say something like this -- '' I , Leonard Everard , of Brindehow , in the Parish of Normanstand , in the County of Norcester , hereby acknowledge the receipt from Miss Laetitia Rowly of nine hundred pounds sterling lent to me in accordance with my request , the same being to clear me of a pressing debt due by me . ' When he had finished writing the receipt Miss Rowly looked it over , and handing it back to him , said : 'Now sign ; and date ! ' He did so with suppressed anger . She folded the document carefully and put it in her pocket . Then taking from the little pouch which she wore at her belt a roll of notes , she counted out on the table nine notes of one hundred pounds each . As she put down the last she said : 'Miss Norman asked me to say that a hundred pounds is added to the sum you specified to her , as doubtless the usurers would , since you are actually behind the time promised for repayment , require something extra as a solatium or to avoid legal proceedings already undertaken . In fact that they would `` put more salt on your tail . '' The expression , I regret to say , is not mine . ' Leonard folded up the notes , put them into his pocket-book , and walked away . He did not feel like adding verbal thanks to the document already signed . As he got near the door the thought struck him ; turning back he said : 'May I ask if Stephen said anything about getting the document ? ' ' I beg your pardon , ' she said icily , 'did you speak of any one ? ' 'Miss Norman , I meant ! ' Miss Rowly 's answer to this came so smartly that it left an added sting . Her arrow was fledged with two feathers so that it must shoot true : her distrust of him and his own impotence . 'Oh no ! Miss Norman knows nothing of this . She simply asked me to give you the money . This is my own doing entirely . You see , I must exercise my judgment on my dear niece 's behalf . Of course it may not be necessary to show her the receipt ; but if it should ever be advisable it is always there . ' He looked at her with anger , not unmixed with admiration , as , bowing rather lower than necessary , he went out of the door , saying sotto voce , between his teeth : 'When my turn comes out you go ! Neck and crop ! Quick ! Normanstand is n't big enough to hold us both ! ' CHAPTER XVIII -- MORE BUSINESS When Leonard tendered the eight hundred pounds in payment of his debt of five hundred , Mr. Cavendish at first refused to take it . But when Leonard calmly but firmly refused to pay a single penny beyond the obligations already incurred , including interest on the full sum for one day , he acquiesced . He knew the type of man fully ; and knew also that in all probability it would not be long before he would come to the Firm again on a borrowing errand . When such time should come , he would put an extra clause into his Memorandum of Agreement which would allow the Firm full power to make whatever extra charge they might choose in case of the slightest default in making payment . Leonard 's visits to town had not of late been many , and such as he had had were not accompanied with a plethora of cash . He now felt that he had earned a holiday ; and it was not till the third morning that he returned to Brindehow . His father made no comment on his absence ; his only allusion to the subject was : 'Back all right ! Any news in town ? ' There was , however , an unwonted suavity in his manner which made Leonard a little anxious . He busied himself for the balance of the morning in getting together all his unpaid accounts and making a schedule of them . The total at first amazed almost as much as it frightened him . He feared what Stephen would say . She had already commented unfavourably on the one amount she had seen . When she was face to face with this she might refuse to pay altogether . It would therefore be wise to propitiate her . What could he do in this direction ? His thoughts naturally turned to the missing letter . If he could get possession of it , it would either serve as a sop or a threat . In the one case she would be so glad to have it back that she would not stick at a few pounds ; in the other it would 'bring her to her senses ' as he put in his own mind his intention of blackmail . He was getting so tightened up in situation that as yet he could only do as he was told , and keep his temper as well as he could . Altogether it was in a chastened mood that he made his appearance at Normanstand later in the afternoon . He was evidently expected , for he was shown into the study without a word . Here Miss Rowly and Stephen joined him . Both were very kind in manner . After the usual greetings and commonplaces Stephen said in a brisk , businesslike way : 'Have you the papers with you ? ' He took the bundle of accounts from his pocket and handed them to her . After his previous experience he would have suggested , had he dared , that he should see Stephen alone ; but he feared the old lady . He therefore merely said : ' I am afraid you will find the amount very large . But I have put down everything ! ' So he had ; and more than everything . At the last an idea struck him that as he was getting so much he might as well have a little more . He therefore added several good-sized amounts which he called 'debts of honour . ' This would , he thought , appeal to the feminine mind . Stephen did not look at the papers at once . She stood up , holding them , and said to Miss Rowly : 'Now , if you will talk to Mr. Everard I will go over these documents quietly by myself . When I have been through them and understand them all I shall come back ; and we will see what can be done . ' She moved gracefully out of the room , closing the door behind her . As is usual with women , she had more than one motive for her action in going away . In the first place , she wished to be alone whilst she went over the schedule of the debts . She feared she might get angry ; and in the present state of her mind towards Leonard the expression of any feeling , even contempt , would not be wise . Her best protection from him would be a manifest kindly negation of any special interest . In the second place , she believed that he would have her letter with the other papers , and she did not wish her aunt to see it , lest she should recognise the writing . In her boudoir , with a beating heart , she untied the string and looked through the papers . Her letter was not among them . For a few seconds she stood stock still , thinking . Then , with a sigh , she sat down and began to read the list of debts , turning to the originals now and again for details . As she went on , her wonder and disgust grew ; and even a sense of fear came into her thoughts . A man who could be so wildly reckless and so selfishly unscrupulous was to be feared . She knew his father was a comparatively poor man , who could not possibly meet such a burden . If he were thus to his father , what might he be to her if he got a chance . The thought of what he might have been to her , had he taken the chance she had given him , never occurred to her . This possibility had already reached the historical stage in her mind . She made a few pencil notes on the list ; and went back to the study . Her mind was made up . She was quite businesslike and calm , did not manifest the slightest disapproval , but seemed to simply accept everything as facts . She asked Leonard a few questions on subjects regarding which she had made notes , such as discounts . Then she held the paper out to him and without any preliminary remark said : 'Will you please put the names to these ? ' 'How do you mean ? ' he asked , flushing . 'The names of the persons to whom these sums marked `` debt of honour '' are due . ' His reply came quickly , and was a little aggressive ; he thought this might be a good time to make a bluff : ' I do not see that that is necessary . I can settle them when I have the money . ' Slowly and without either pause or flurry Stephen replied , looking him straight in the eyes as she handed him the papers : 'Of course it is not necessary ! Few things in the world really are ! I only wanted to help you out of your troubles ; but if you do not wish me to . . . ! ' Leonard interrupted in alarm : 'No ! no ! I only spoke of these items . You see , being `` debts of honour '' I ought not to give the names . ' Looking with a keen glance at her set face he saw she was obdurate ; and , recognising his defeat , said as calmly as he could , for he felt raging : 'All right ! Give me the paper ! ' Bending over the table he wrote . When she took the paper , a look half surprised , half indignant , passed over her face . Her watchful aunt saw it , and bending over looked also at the paper . Then she too smiled bitterly . Leonard had printed in the names ! The feminine keenness of both women had made his intention manifest . He did not wish for the possibility of his handwriting being recognised . His punishment came quickly . With a dazzling smile Stephen said to him : 'But , Leonard , you have forgotten to put the addresses ! ' 'Is that necessary ? ' 'Of course it is ! Why , you silly , how is the money to be paid if there are no addresses ? ' Leonard felt like a rat in a trap ; but he had no alternative . So irritated was he , and so anxious to hide his irritation that , forgetting his own caution , he wrote , not in printing characters but in his own handwriting , addresses evolved from his own imagination . Stephen 's eyes twinkled as he handed her the paper : he had given himself away all round . Leonard having done all that as yet had been required of him , felt that he might now ask a further favour , so he said : 'There is one of those bills which I have promised to pay by Monday . ' 'Promised ? ' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes . She had no idea of sparing him , she remembered the printed names . 'Why , Leonard , I thought you said you were unable to pay any of those debts ? ' Again he had put himself in a false position . He could not say that it was to his father he had made the promise ; for he had already told Stephen that he had been afraid to tell him of his debts . In his desperation , for Miss Rowly 's remorseless glasses were full on him , he said : ' I thought I was justified in making the promise after what you said about the pleasure it would be to help me . You remember , that day on the hilltop ? ' If he had wished to disconcert her he was mistaken ; she had already thought over and over again of every form of embarrassment her unhappy action might bring on her at his hands . She now said sweetly and calmly , so sweetly and so calmly that he , with knowledge of her secret , was alarmed : 'But that was not a promise to pay . If you will remember it was only an offer , which is a very different thing . You did not accept it then ! ' She was herself somewhat desperate , or she would not have sailed so close to the wind . 'Ah , but I accepted later ! ' he said quickly , feeling in his satisfaction in an epigrammatic answer a certain measure of victory . He felt his mistake when she went on calmly : 'Offers like that are not repeated . They are but phantoms , after all . They come at their own choice , when they do come ; and they stay but the measure of a breath or two . You can not summon them ! ' Leonard fell into the current of the metaphor and answered : ' I do n't know that even that is impossible . There are spells which call , and recall , even phantoms ! ' 'Indeed ! ' Stephen was anxious to find his purpose . Leonard felt that he was getting on , that he was again acquiring the upper hand ; so he pushed on the metaphor , more and more satisfied with himself : 'And it is wonderful how simple some spells , and these the most powerful , can be . A remembered phrase , the recollection of a pleasant meeting , the smell of a forgotten flower , or the sight of a forgotten letter ; any or all of these can , through memory , bring back the past . And it is often in the past that the secret of the future lies ! ' Miss Rowly felt that something was going on before her which she could not understand . Anything of this man 's saying which she could not fathom must be at least dangerous ; so she determined to spoil his purpose , whatever it might be . 'Dear me ! That is charmingly poetic ! Past and future ; memory and the smell of flowers ; meetings and letters ! It is quite philosophy . Do explain it all , Mr . Everard ! ' Leonard was not prepared to go on under the circumstances . His own mention of 'letter , ' although he had deliberately used it with the intention of frightening Stephen , had frightened himself . It reminded him that he had not brought , had not got , the letter ; and that as yet he was not certain of getting the money . Stephen also had noted the word , and determined not to pass the matter by . She said gaily : 'If a letter is a spell , I think you have a spell of mine , which is a spell of my own weaving . You were to show me the letter in which I asked you to come to see me . It was in that , I think you said , that I mentioned your debts ; but I do n't remember doing so . Show it to me ! ' ' I have not got it with me ! ' This was said with mulish sullenness . 'Why not ? ' ' I forgot . ' 'That is a pity ! It is always a pity to forget things in a business transaction ; as this is . I think , Auntie , we must wait till we have all the documents , before we can complete this transaction ! ' Leonard was seriously alarmed . If the matter of the loan were not gone on with at once the jeweller 's bill could not be paid by Monday , and the result would be another scene with his father . He turned to Stephen and said as charmingly as he could , and he was all in earnest now : ' I 'm awfully sorry ! But these debts have been so worrying me that they put lots of things out of my head . That bill to be paid on Monday , when I have n't a feather to fly with , is enough to drive a fellow off his chump . The moment I lay my hands on the letter I shall keep it with me so that I ca n't forget it again . Wo n't you forgive me for this time ? ' 'Forgive ! ' she answered , with a laugh . 'Why it 's not worth forgiveness ! It is not worth a second thought ! All right ! Leonard , make your mind easy ; the bill will be paid on Monday ! ' Miss Rowly said quietly : ' I have to be in London on Monday afternoon ; I can pay it for you . ' This was a shock to Leonard ; he said impulsively : 'Oh , I say ! Ca n't I . . . ' His words faded away as the old lady again raised her lorgnon and gazed at him calmly . She went on : 'You know , my dear , it wo n't be even out of my way , as I have to call at Mr. Malpas 's office , and I can go there from the hotel in Regent Street . ' This was all news to Stephen . She did not know that her aunt had intended going to London ; and indeed she did not know of any business with Mr. Malpas , whose firm had been London solicitor to the Rowlys for several generations . She had no doubt , however , as to the old lady's intention . It was plain to her that she wanted to help . So she thanked her sweetly . Leonard could say nothing . He seemed to be left completely out of it . When Stephen rose , as a hint to him that it was time for him to go , he said humbly , as he left : 'Would it be possible that I should have the receipt before Monday evening ? I want to show it to my father . ' 'Certainly ! ' said the old lady , answering him . ' I shall be back by the two o'clock train ; and if you happen to be at the railway station at Norcester when I arrive I can give it to you ! ' He went away relieved , but vindictive ; determined in his own mind that when he had received the money for the rest of the debts he would see Stephen , when the old lady was not present , and have it out with her . CHAPTER XIX -- A LETTER On Monday evening after dinner Mr. Everard and his son sat for a while in silence . They had not met since morning ; and in the presence of the servants conversation had been scrupulously polite . Now , though they were both waiting to talk , neither liked to begin . The older man was outwardly placid , when Leonard , a little flushed and a little nervous of voice , began : 'Have you had any more bills ? ' He had expected none , and thus hoped to begin by scoring against his father . It was something of a set-down when the latter , taking some papers from his breast-pocket , handed them to him , saying : 'Only these ! ' Leonard took them in silence and looked at them . All were requests for payment of debts due by his son . In each case the full bill was enclosed . He was silent a while ; but his father spoke : 'It would almost seem as if all these people had made up their minds that you were of no further use to them . ' Then without pausing he said , but in a sharper voice : 'Have you paid the jewellers ? This is Monday ! ' Without speaking Leonard took leisurely from his pocket folded paper . This he opened , and , after deliberately smoothing out the folds , handed it to his father . Doubtless something in his manner had already convinced the latter that the debt was paid . He took the paper in as leisurely a way as it had been given , adjusted his spectacles , and read it . Seeing that his son had scored this time , he covered his chagrin with an appearance of paternal satisfaction . 'Good ! ' For many reasons he was glad the debt was paid He was himself too poor a man to allow the constant drain his son 's debts , and too careful of his position to be willing have such exposure as would come with a County Court action against his son . All the same , his exasperation continued . Neither was his quiver yet empty . He shot his next arrow : ' I am glad you paid off those usurers ! ' Leonard did not like the definite way he spoke . Still in silence , he took from his pocket a second paper , which he handed over unfolded . Mr. Everard read it , and returned it politely , with again one word : 'Good ! ' For a few minutes there was silence . The father spoke again : 'Those other debts , LONDON : ROBERT HAYES , LTD. SIXTY-ONE FLEET STREET , E.C . [ _All rights reserved_ ] FORE-GLIMPSE ' I would rather be an angel than God ! ' The voice of the speaker sounded clearly through the hawthorn tree . The young man and the young girl who sat together on the low tombstone looked at each other . They had heard the voices of the two children talking , but had not noticed what they said ; it was the sentiment , not the sound , which roused their attention . The girl put her finger to her lips to impress silence , and the man nodded ; they sat as still as mice whilst the two children went on talking . * * * * * The scene would have gladdened a painter 's heart . An old churchyard . The church low and square-towered , with long mullioned windows , the yellow- grey stone roughened by age and tender-hued with lichens . Round it clustered many tombstones tilted in all directions . Behind the church a line of gnarled and twisted yews . The churchyard was full of fine trees . On one side a magnificent cedar ; on the other a great copper beech . Here and there among the tombs and headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green grass . The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight ; the lilac , the hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed the edge of the lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance . The yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled harts-tongues , and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house- leek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose of perfect summer . But amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures seated on the grey old tomb stood out conspicuously . The man was in conventional hunting-dress : red coat , white stock , black hat , white breeches , and top- boots . The girl was one of the richest , most glowing , and yet withal daintiest figures the eye of man could linger on . She was in riding-habit of hunting scarlet cloth ; her black hat was tipped forward by piled-up masses red-golden hair . Round her neck was a white lawn scarf in the fashion of a man 's hunting-stock , close fitting , and sinking into a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy twill . As she sat with the long skirt across her left arm her tiny black top-boots appeared underneath . Her gauntleted gloves were of white buckskin ; her riding-whip was plaited of white leather , topped with ivory and banded with gold . Even in her fourteenth year Miss Stephen Norman gave promise of striking beauty ; beauty of a rarely composite character . In her the various elements of her race seemed to have cropped out . The firm-set jaw , with chin broader and more square than is usual in a woman , and the wide fine forehead and aquiline nose marked the high descent from Saxon through Norman . The glorious mass of red hair , of the true flame colour , showed the blood of another ancient ancestor of Northern race , and suited well with the voluptuous curves of the full , crimson lips . The purple-black eyes , the raven eyebrows and eyelashes , and the fine curve of the nostrils spoke of the Eastern blood of the far-back wife of the Crusader . Already she was tall for her age , with something of that lankiness which marks the early development of a really fine figure . Long-legged , long- necked , as straight as a lance , with head poised on the proud neck like a lily on its stem . Stephen Norman certainly gave promise of a splendid womanhood . Pride , self-reliance and dominance were marked in every feature ; in her bearing and in her lightest movement . Her companion , Harold An Wolf , was some five years her senior , and by means of those five years and certain qualities had long stood in the position of her mentor . He was more than six feet two in height , deep- chested , broad-shouldered , lean-flanked , long-armed and big-handed . He had that appearance strength , with well-poised neck and forward set of the head , which marks the successful athlete . The two sat quiet , listening . Through the quiet hum of afternoon came the voices of the two children . Outside the lich-gate , under the shade of the spreading cedar , the horses stamped occasionally as the flies troubled them . The grooms were mounted ; one held the delicate-limbed white Arab , the other the great black horse . ' I would rather be an angel than God ! ' The little girl who made the remark was an ideal specimen of the village Sunday-school child . Blue-eyed , rosy-cheeked , thick-legged , with her straight brown hair tied into a hard bunch with a much-creased , cherry- coloured ribbon . A glance at the girl would have satisfied the most sceptical as to her goodness . Without being in any way smug she was radiant with self-satisfaction and well-doing . A child of the people ; an early riser ; a help to her mother ; a good angel to her father ; a little mother to her brothers and sisters ; cleanly in mind and body ; self-reliant , full of faith , cheerful . The other little girl was prettier , but of a more stubborn type ; more passionate , less organised , and infinitely more assertive . Black-haired , black-eyed , swarthy , large-mouthed , snub-nosed ; the very type and essence of unrestrained , impulsive , emotional , sensual nature . A seeing eye would have noted inevitable danger for the early years of her womanhood . She seemed amazed by the self-abnegation implied by her companion's statement ; after a pause she replied : ' I would n't ! I 'd rather be up at the top of everything and give orders to the angels if I chose . I ca n't think , Marjorie , why you 'd rather take orders than give them . ' 'That 's just it , Susan . I do n't want to give orders ; I 'd rather obey them . It must be very terrible to have to think of things so much , that you want everything done your own way . And besides , I should n't like to have to be just ! ' 'Why not ? ' the voice was truculent , though there was wistfulness in it also . 'Oh Susan . Just fancy having to punish ; for of course justice needs punishing as well as praising . Now an angel has such a nice time , helping people and comforting them , and bringing sunshine into dark places . Putting down fresh dew every morning ; making the flowers grow , and bringing babies and taking care of them till their mothers find them . Of course God is very good and very sweet and very merciful , but oh , He must be very terrible . ' 'All the same I would rather be God and able to do things ! ' Then the children moved off out of earshot . The two seated on the tombstone looked after them . The first to speak was the girl , who said : 'That 's very sweet and good of Marjorie ; but do you know , Harold , I like Susie 's idea better . ' 'Which idea was that , Stephen ? ' 'Why , did n't you notice what she said : `` I 'd like to be God and be able to do things '' ? ' 'Yes , ' he said after a moment 's reflection . 'That 's a fine idea in the abstract ; but I doubt of its happiness in the long-run . ' 'Doubt of its happiness ? Come now ? what could there be better , after all ? Is n't it good enough to be God ? What more do you want ? ' The girl 's tone was quizzical , but her great black eyes blazed with some thought of sincerity which lay behind the fun . The young man shook his head with a smile of kindly tolerance as he answered : 'It is n't that -- surely you must know it . I 'm ambitious enough , goodness knows ; but there are bounds to satisfy even me . But I 'm not sure that the good little thing is n't right . She seemed , somehow , to hit a bigger truth than she knew : `` fancy having to be just . '' ' ' I do n't see much difficulty in that . Anyone can be just ! ' 'Pardon me , ' he answered , 'there is perhaps nothing so difficult in the whole range of a man 's work . ' There was distinct defiance in the girl's eyes as she asked : ' A man 's work ! Why a man 's work ? Is n't it a woman 's work also ? ' 'Well , I suppose it ought to be , theoretically ; practically it is n't . ' 'And why not , pray ? ' The mere suggestion of any disability of woman as such aroused immediate antagonism . Her companion suppressed a smile as he answered deliberately : 'Because , my dear Stephen , the Almighty has ordained that justice is not a virtue women can practise . Mind , I do not say women are unjust . Far from it , where there are no interests of those dear to them they can be of a sincerity of justice that can make a man 's blood run cold . But justice in the abstract is not an ordinary virtue : it has to be considerate as well as stern , and above all interest of all kinds and of every one -- ' The girl interrupted hotly : ' I do n't agree with you at all . You ca n't give an instance where women are unjust . I do n't mean of course individual instances , but classes of cases where injustice is habitual . ' The suppressed smile cropped out now unconsciously round the man 's lips in a way which was intensely aggravating to the girl . ' I 'll give you a few , ' he said . 'Did you ever know a mother just to a boy who beat her own boy at school ? ' The girl replied quietly : 'Ill-treatment and bullying are subjects for punishment , not justice . ' 'Oh , I do n't mean that kind of beating . I mean getting the prizes their own boys contended for ; getting above them in class ; showing superior powers in running or cricket or swimming , or in any of the forms of effort in which boys vie with each other . ' The girl reflected , then she spoke : 'Well , you may be right . I do n't altogether admit it , but I accept it as not on my side . But this is only one case . ' ' A pretty common one . Do you think that Sheriff of Galway , who in default of a hangman hanged his son with his own hands , would have done so if he had been a woman ? ' The girl answered at once : 'Frankly , no . I do n't suppose the mother was ever born who would do such a thing . But that is not a common case , is it ? Have you any other ? ' The young man paused before he spoke : 'There is another , but I do n't think I can go into it fairly with you . ' 'Why not ? ' 'Well , because after all you know , Stephen , you are only a girl and you ca n't be expected to know . ' The girl laughed : 'Well , if it 's anything about women surely a girl , even of my tender age , must know something more of it , or be able to guess at , than any young man can . However , say what you think and I 'll tell you frankly if I agree -- that is if a woman can be just , in such a matter . ' 'Shortly the point is this : Can a woman be just to another woman , or to a man for the matter of that , where either her own affection or a fault of the other is concerned ? ' ' I do n't see any reason to the contrary . Surely pride alone should ensure justice in the former case , and the consciousness of superiority in the other . ' The young man shook his head : 'Pride and the consciousness of superiority ! Are they not much the same thing . But whether or no , if either of them has to be relied on , I'm afraid the scales of Justice would want regulating , and her sword should be blunted in case its edge should be turned back on herself . I have an idea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you individually , it would be a failure with the average . However , as it would be in any case a rule subject to many exceptions I must let it go . ' Harold looked at his watch and rose . Stephen followed him ; transferring her whip into the hand which held up the skirt , she took his arm with her right hand in the pretty way in which a young girl clings to her elders . Together they went out at the lich-gate . The groom drew over with the horses . Stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar . Then putting her foot into Harold 's ready hand she sprang lightly into the saddle . Harold swung himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an accomplished rider . As the two rode up the road , keeping on the shady side under the trees , Stephen said quietly , half to herself , as if the sentence had impressed itself on her mind : 'To be God and able to do things ! ' Harold rode on in silence . The chill of some vague fear was upon him . CHAPTER I -- STEPHEN Stephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on middle age , when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate heir to his great estate . Whereupon , with his wonted decision , he set about looking for a wife . He had been a close friend of his next neighbour , Squire Rowly , ever since their college days . They had , of course , been often in each other 's houses , and Rowly 's young sister -- almost a generation younger than himself , and the sole fruit of his father 's second marriage -- had been like a little sister to him too . She had , in the twenty years which had elapsed , grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman . In all the past years , with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close companionship , the feeling never altered . Squire Norman would have been surprised had he been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself compelled to present the picture of a woman , not a child . Now , however , when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward , he awoke to the fact that Margaret came within the category of those he sought . His usual decision ran its course . Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a stronger and perhaps more selfish feeling . Before he even knew it , he was head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour . Norman was a fine man , stalwart and handsome ; his forty years sat so lightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a woman 's mind . Margaret had always liked him and trusted him ; he was the big brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do . His presence had always been a gladness ; and the sex of the girl , first unconsciously then consciously , answered to the man 's overtures , and her consent was soon obtained . When in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected , Squire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy , and held the idea so tenaciously that his wife , who loved him deeply , gave up warning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against too fond a hope . She saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case it should prove to be a girl . He was , however , so fixed on the point that she determined to say no more . After all , it might be a boy ; the chances were equal . The Squire would not listen to any one else at all ; so as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever . His arrangements were made on the base that he would have a son . The name was of course decided . Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of Normanstand for ages -- as far back as the records went ; and Stephen the new heir of course would be . Like all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the time drew near . In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became passive rather than active . Indeed , the idea of a son was so deeply fixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the young wife he idolised . When instead of a son a daughter was born , the Doctor and the nurse , who knew his views on the subject , held back from the mother for a little the knowledge of the sex . Dame Norman was so weak that the Doctor feared lest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment , might militate against her . Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his study , and went resolutely at his task . 'Well , Squire , I congratulate you on the birth of your child ! ' Norman was of course struck with the use of the word 'child ' ; but the cause of his anxiety was manifested by his first question : 'How is she , Doctor ? Is she safe ? ' The child was after all of secondary importance ! The Doctor breathed more freely ; the question had lightened his task . There was , therefore , more assurance in his voice as he answered : 'She is safely through the worst of her trouble , but I am greatly anxious yet . She is very weak . I fear anything that might upset her . ' The Squire 's voice came quick and strong : 'There must be no upset ! And now tell me about my son ? ' He spoke the last word half with pride , half bashfully . 'Your son is a daughter ! ' There was silence for so long that the Doctor began to be anxious . Squire Norman sat quite still ; his right hand resting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the knuckles looked white and the veins red . After a long slow breath he spoke : 'She , my daughter , is well ? ' The Doctor answered with cheerful alacrity : 'Splendid ! -- I never saw a finer child in my life . She will be a comfort and an honour to you ! ' The Squire spoke again : 'What does her mother think ? I suppose she 's very proud of her ? ' 'She does not know yet that it is a girl . I thought it better not to let her know till I had told you . ' 'Why ? ' 'Because -- because -- Norman , old friend , you know why ! Because you had set your heart on a son ; and I know how it would grieve that sweet young wife and mother to feel your disappointment . I want your lips to be the first to tell her ; so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a daughter has been born to you . ' The Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the other 's shoulder . There was almost a break in his voice as he said : 'Thank you , my old friend , my true friend , for your thought . When may I see her ? ' 'By right , not yet . But , as knowing your views , she may fret herself till she knows , I think you had better come at once . ' All Norman 's love and strength combined for his task . As he leant over and kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as he said : 'Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms ? ' For an instant there came a chill to the mother 's heart that her hopes had been so far disappointed ; but then came the reaction of her joy that her husband , her baby 's father , was pleased . There was a heavenly dawn of red on her pale face as she drew her husband 's head down and kissed him . 'Oh , my dear , ' she said , ' I am so happy that you are pleased ! ' The nurse took the mother 's hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in the father 's arms . He held the mother 's hand as he kissed the baby 's brow . The Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away . He went with careful footsteps , looking behind as he went . After dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters ; but presently he asked : ' I suppose , Doctor , it is no sort of rule that the first child regulates the sex of a family ? ' 'No , of course not . Otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed in one family , as is nearly always the case . But , my friend , ' he went on , 'you must not build hopes so far away . I have to tell you that your wife is far from strong . Even now she is not so well as I could wish , and there yet may be change . ' The Squire leaped impetuously to his feet as he spoke quickly : 'Then why are we waiting here ? Can nothing be done ? Let us have the best help , the best advice in the world . ' The Doctor raised his hand . 'Nothing can be done as yet . I have only fear . ' 'Then let us be ready in case your fears should be justified ! Who are the best men in London to help in such a case ? ' The Doctor mentioned two names ; and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to Norcester , the nearest telegraph centre . The messenger was to arrange for a special train if necessary . Shortly afterwards the Doctor went again to see his patient . After a long absence he came back , pale and agitated . Norman felt his heart sink when he saw him ; a groan broke from him as the Doctor spoke : 'She is much worse ! I am in great fear that she may pass away before the morning ! ' The Squire 's strong voice was clouded , with a hoarse veil as he asked : 'May I see her ? ' 'Not yet ; at present she is sleeping . She may wake strengthened ; in which case you may see her . But if not -- ' 'If not ? ' -- the voice was not like his own . 'Then I shall send for you at once ! ' The Doctor returned to his vigil . The Squire , left alone , sank on his knees , his face in his hands ; his great shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief . An hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps . He sprang to the door : 'Well ? ' 'You had better come now . ' 'Is she better ? ' 'Alas ! no . I fear her minutes are numbered . School yourself , my dear old friend ! God will help you in this bitter hour . All you can do now is to make her last moments happy . ' ' I know ! I know ! ' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion wondered . When they came into the room Margaret was dozing . When her eyes opened and she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a glad look ; which , alas ! soon changed to one of pain . She motioned to him to bend down . He knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow ; his arms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength he would shield her from all harm . Her voice came very low and in broken gasps ; she was summoning all her strength that she might speak : 'My dear , dear husband , I am so sad at leaving you ! You have made me so happy , and I love you so ! Forgive me , dear , for the pain I know you will suffer when I am gone ! And oh , Stephen , I know you will cherish our little one -- yours and mine -- when I am gone . She will have no mother ; you will have to be father and mother too . ' ' I will hold her in my very heart 's core , my darling , as I hold you ! ' He could hardly speak from emotion . She went on : 'And oh , my dear , you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on your name ? ' And then a sudden light came into her eyes ; and there was exultation in her weak voice as she said : 'She is to be our only one ; let her be indeed our son ! Call her the name we both love ! ' For answer he rose and laid his hand very , very tenderly on the babe as he said : 'This dear one , my sweet wife , who will carry your soul in her breast , will be my son ; the only son I shall ever have . All my life long I shall , please Almighty God , so love her -- our little Stephen -- as you and I love each other ! ' She laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her child . Then she raised the other weak arm , and placed it round his neck , and their lips met . Her soul went out in this last kiss . CHAPTER II -- THE HEART OF A CHILD For some weeks after his wife 's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed with grief . He made a brave effort , however , to go through the routine of his life ; and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of bearing his loss with resignation . But within , all was desolation . Little Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her father's heart . The little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms must have realised with all its senses that , in all that it saw and heard and touched , there was nothing but love and help and protection . Gradually the trust was followed by expectation . If by some chance the father was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient and cast persistent , longing glances at the door . When he came all was joy . Time went quickly by , and Norman was only recalled to its passing by the growth of his child . Seedtime and harvest , the many comings of nature's growth were such commonplaces to him , and had been for so many years , that they made on him no impressions of comparison . But",The Man
Pelham Grenville,"[ Illustration ] My Man Jeeves by P. G. Wodehouse 1919 Contents LEAVE IT TO JEEVES JEEVES AND THE UNBIDDEN GUEST JEEVES AND THE HARD-BOILED EGG ABSENT TREATMENT HELPING FREDDIE RALLYING ROUND OLD GEORGE DOING CLARENCE A BIT OF GOOD THE AUNT AND THE SLUGGARD LEAVE IT TO JEEVES Jeeves—my man , you know—is really a most extraordinary chap . So capable . Honestly , I shouldn ’ t know what to do without him . On broader lines he ’ s like those chappies who sit peering sadly over the marble battlements at the Pennsylvania Station in the place marked “ Inquiries. ” You know the Johnnies I mean . You go up to them and say : “ When ’ s the next train for Melonsquashville , Tennessee ? ” and they reply , without stopping to think , “ Two-forty-three , track ten , change at San Francisco. ” And they ’ re right every time . Well , Jeeves gives you just the same impression of omniscience . As an instance of what I mean , I remember meeting Monty Byng in Bond Street one morning , looking the last word in a grey check suit , and I felt I should never be happy till I had one like it . I dug the address of the tailors out of him , and had them working on the thing inside the hour . “ Jeeves , ” I said that evening . “ I ’ m getting a check suit like that one of Mr. Byng ’ s. ” “ Injudicious , sir , ” he said firmly . “ It will not become you. ” “ What absolute rot ! It ’ s the soundest thing I ’ ve struck for years. ” “ Unsuitable for you , sir. ” Well , the long and the short of it was that the confounded thing came home , and I put it on , and when I caught sight of myself in the glass I nearly swooned . Jeeves was perfectly right . I looked a cross between a music-hall comedian and a cheap bookie . Yet Monty had looked fine in absolutely the same stuff . These things are just Life ’ s mysteries , and that ’ s all there is to it . But it isn ’ t only that Jeeves ’ s judgment about clothes is infallible , though , of course , that ’ s really the main thing . The man knows everything . There was the matter of that tip on the “ Lincolnshire. ” I forget now how I got it , but it had the aspect of being the real , red-hot tabasco . “ Jeeves , ” I said , for I ’ m fond of the man , and like to do him a good turn when I can , “ if you want to make a bit of money have something on Wonderchild for the ‘ Lincolnshire. ’ ” He shook his head . “ I ’ d rather not , sir. ” “ But it ’ s the straight goods . I ’ m going to put my shirt on him. ” “ I do not recommend it , sir . The animal is not intended to win . Second place is what the stable is after. ” Perfect piffle , I thought , of course . How the deuce could Jeeves know anything about it ? Still , you know what happened . Wonderchild led till he was breathing on the wire , and then Banana Fritter came along and nosed him out . I went straight home and rang for Jeeves . “ After this , ” I said , “ not another step for me without your advice . From now on consider yourself the brains of the establishment. ” “ Very good , sir . I shall endeavour to give satisfaction. ” And he has , by Jove ! I ’ m a bit short on brain myself ; the old bean would appear to have been constructed more for ornament than for use , don ’ t you know ; but give me five minutes to talk the thing over with Jeeves , and I ’ m game to advise any one about anything . And that ’ s why , when Bruce Corcoran came to me with his troubles , my first act was to ring the bell and put it up to the lad with the bulging forehead . “ Leave it to Jeeves , ” I said . I first got to know Corky when I came to New York . He was a pal of my cousin Gussie , who was in with a lot of people down Washington Square way . I don ’ t know if I ever told you about it , but the reason why I left England was because I was sent over by my Aunt Agatha to try to stop young Gussie marrying a girl on the vaudeville stage , and I got the whole thing so mixed up that I decided that it would be a sound scheme for me to stop on in America for a bit instead of going back and having long cosy chats about the thing with aunt . So I sent Jeeves out to find a decent apartment , and settled down for a bit of exile . I ’ m bound to say that New York ’ s a topping place to be exiled in . Everybody was awfully good to me , and there seemed to be plenty of things going on , and I ’ m a wealthy bird , so everything was fine . Chappies introduced me to other chappies , and so on and so forth , and it wasn ’ t long before I knew squads of the right sort , some who rolled in dollars in houses up by the Park , and others who lived with the gas turned down mostly around Washington Square—artists and writers and so forth . Brainy coves . Corky was one of the artists . A portrait-painter , he called himself , but he hadn ’ t painted any portraits . He was sitting on the side-lines with a blanket over his shoulders , waiting for a chance to get into the game . You see , the catch about portrait-painting—I ’ ve looked into the thing a bit—is that you can ’ t start painting portraits till people come along and ask you to , and they won ’ t come and ask you to until you ’ ve painted a lot first . This makes it kind of difficult for a chappie . Corky managed to get along by drawing an occasional picture for the comic papers—he had rather a gift for funny stuff when he got a good idea—and doing bedsteads and chairs and things for the advertisements . His principal source of income , however , was derived from biting the ear of a rich uncle—one Alexander Worple , who was in the jute business . I ’ m a bit foggy as to what jute is , but it ’ s apparently something the populace is pretty keen on , for Mr. Worple had made quite an indecently large stack out of it . Now , a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a pretty soft snap : but , according to Corky , such is not the case . Corky ’ s uncle was a robust sort of cove , who looked like living for ever . He was fifty-one , and it seemed as if he might go to par . It was not this , however , that distressed poor old Corky , for he was not bigoted and had no objection to the man going on living . What Corky kicked at was the way the above Worple used to harry him . Corky ’ s uncle , you see , didn ’ t want him to be an artist . He didn ’ t think he had any talent in that direction . He was always urging him to chuck Art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom and work his way up . Jute had apparently become a sort of obsession with him . He seemed to attach almost a spiritual importance to it . And what Corky said was that , while he didn ’ t know what they did at the bottom of the jute business , instinct told him that it was something too beastly for words . Corky , moreover , believed in his future as an artist . Some day , he said , he was going to make a hit . Meanwhile , by using the utmost tact and persuasiveness , he was inducing his uncle to cough up very grudgingly a small quarterly allowance . He wouldn ’ t have got this if his uncle hadn ’ t had a hobby . Mr. Worple was peculiar in this respect . As a rule , from what I ’ ve observed , the American captain of industry doesn ’ t do anything out of business hours . When he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night , he just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a captain of industry again . But Mr. Worple in his spare time was what is known as an ornithologist . He had written a book called _American Birds_ , and was writing another , to be called _More American Birds_ . When he had finished that , the presumption was that he would begin a third , and keep on till the supply of American birds gave out . Corky used to go to him about once every three months and let him talk about American birds . Apparently you could do what you liked with old Worple if you gave him his head first on his pet subject , so these little chats used to make Corky ’ s allowance all right for the time being . But it was pretty rotten for the poor chap . There was the frightful suspense , you see , and , apart from that , birds , except when broiled and in the society of a cold bottle , bored him stiff . To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple , he was a man of extremely uncertain temper , and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account , was just another proof of his innate idiocy . I should imagine Jeeves feels very much the same about me . So when Corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon , shooing a girl in front of him , and said , “ Bertie , I want you to meet my fiancée , Miss Singer , ” the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely the one which he had come to consult me about . The very first words I spoke were , “ Corky , how about your uncle ? ” The poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs . He was looking anxious and worried , like a man who has done the murder all right but can ’ t think what the deuce to do with the body . “ We ’ re so scared , Mr. Wooster , ” said the girl . “ We were hoping that you might suggest a way of breaking it to him. ” Muriel Singer was one of those very quiet , appealing girls who have a way of looking at you with their big eyes as if they thought you were the greatest thing on earth and wondered that you hadn ’ t got on to it yet yourself . She sat there in a sort of shrinking way , looking at me as if she were saying to herself , “ Oh , I do hope this great strong man isn ’ t going to hurt me. ” She gave a fellow a protective kind of feeling , made him want to stroke her hand and say , “ There , there , little one ! ” or words to that effect . She made me feel that there was nothing I wouldn ’ t do for her . She was rather like one of those innocent-tasting American drinks which creep imperceptibly into your system so that , before you know what you ’ re doing , you ’ re starting out to reform the world by force if necessary and pausing on your way to tell the large man in the corner that , if he looks at you like that , you will knock his head off . What I mean is , she made me feel alert and dashing , like a jolly old knight-errant or something of that kind . I felt that I was with her in this thing to the limit . “ I don ’ t see why your uncle shouldn ’ t be most awfully bucked , ” I said to Corky . “ He will think Miss Singer the ideal wife for you. ” Corky declined to cheer up . “ You don ’ t know him . Even if he did like Muriel he wouldn ’ t admit it . That ’ s the sort of pig-headed guy he is . It would be a matter of principle with him to kick . All he would consider would be that I had gone and taken an important step without asking his advice , and he would raise Cain automatically . He ’ s always done it. ” I strained the old bean to meet this emergency . “ You want to work it so that he makes Miss Singer ’ s acquaintance without knowing that you know her . Then you come along—— ” “ But how can I work it that way ? ” I saw his point . That was the catch . “ There ’ s only one thing to do , ” I said . “ What ’ s that ? ” “ Leave it to Jeeves. ” And I rang the bell . “ Sir ? ” said Jeeves , kind of manifesting himself . One of the rummy things about Jeeves is that , unless you watch like a hawk , you very seldom see him come into a room . He ’ s like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them . I ’ ve got a cousin who ’ s what they call a Theosophist , and he says he ’ s often nearly worked the thing himself , but couldn ’ t quite bring it off , probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie . The moment I saw the man standing there , registering respectful attention , a weight seemed to roll off my mind . I felt like a lost child who spots his father in the offing . There was something about him that gave me confidence . Jeeves is a tallish man , with one of those dark , shrewd faces . His eye gleams with the light of pure intelligence . “ Jeeves , we want your advice. ” “ Very good , sir. ” I boiled down Corky ’ s painful case into a few well-chosen words . “ So you see what it amount to , Jeeves . We want you to suggest some way by which Mr. Worple can make Miss Singer ’ s acquaintance without getting on to the fact that Mr. Corcoran already knows her . Understand ? ” “ Perfectly , sir. ” “ Well , try to think of something. ” “ I have thought of something already , sir. ” “ You have ! ” “ The scheme I would suggest can not fail of success , but it has what may seem to you a drawback , sir , in that it requires a certain financial outlay. ” “ He means , ” I translated to Corky , “ that he has got a pippin of an idea , but it ’ s going to cost a bit. ” Naturally the poor chap ’ s face dropped , for this seemed to dish the whole thing . But I was still under the influence of the girl ’ s melting gaze , and I saw that this was where I started in as a knight-errant . “ You can count on me for all that sort of thing , Corky , ” I said . “ Only too glad . Carry on , Jeeves. ” “ I would suggest , sir , that Mr. Corcoran take advantage of Mr. Worple ’ s attachment to ornithology. ” “ How on earth did you know that he was fond of birds ? ” “ It is the way these New York apartments are constructed , sir . Quite unlike our London houses . The partitions between the rooms are of the flimsiest nature . With no wish to overhear , I have sometimes heard Mr. Corcoran expressing himself with a generous strength on the subject I have mentioned. ” “ Oh ! Well ? ” “ Why should not the young lady write a small volume , to be entitled—let us say—_The Children ’ s Book of American Birds_ , and dedicate it to Mr. Worple ! A limited edition could be published at your expense , sir , and a great deal of the book would , of course , be given over to eulogistic remarks concerning Mr. Worple ’ s own larger treatise on the same subject . I should recommend the dispatching of a presentation copy to Mr. Worple , immediately on publication , accompanied by a letter in which the young lady asks to be allowed to make the acquaintance of one to whom she owes so much . This would , I fancy , produce the desired result , but as I say , the expense involved would be considerable. ” I felt like the proprietor of a performing dog on the vaudeville stage when the tyke has just pulled off his trick without a hitch . I had betted on Jeeves all along , and I had known that he wouldn ’ t let me down . It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing my clothes and what-not . If I had half Jeeves ’ s brain , I should have a stab at being Prime Minister or something . “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ that is absolutely ripping ! One of your very best efforts. ” “ Thank you , sir. ” The girl made an objection . “ But I ’ m sure I couldn ’ t write a book about anything . I can ’ t even write good letters. ” “ Muriel ’ s talents , ” said Corky , with a little cough “ lie more in the direction of the drama , Bertie . I didn ’ t mention it before , but one of our reasons for being a trifle nervous as to how Uncle Alexander will receive the news is that Muriel is in the chorus of that show _Choose your Exit_ at the Manhattan . It ’ s absurdly unreasonable , but we both feel that that fact might increase Uncle Alexander ’ s natural tendency to kick like a steer. ” I saw what he meant . Goodness knows there was fuss enough in our family when I tried to marry into musical comedy a few years ago . And the recollection of my Aunt Agatha ’ s attitude in the matter of Gussie and the vaudeville girl was still fresh in my mind . I don ’ t know why it is—one of these psychology sharps could explain it , I suppose—but uncles and aunts , as a class , are always dead against the drama , legitimate or otherwise . They don ’ t seem able to stick it at any price . But Jeeves had a solution , of course . “ I fancy it would be a simple matter , sir , to find some impecunious author who would be glad to do the actual composition of the volume for a small fee . It is only necessary that the young lady ’ s name should appear on the title page. ” “ That ’ s true , ” said Corky . “ Sam Patterson would do it for a hundred dollars . He writes a novelette , three short stories , and ten thousand words of a serial for one of the all-fiction magazines under different names every month . A little thing like this would be nothing to him . I ’ ll get after him right away. ” “ Fine ! ” “ Will that be all , sir ? ” said Jeeves . “ Very good , sir . Thank you , sir. ” I always used to think that publishers had to be devilish intelligent fellows , loaded down with the grey matter ; but I ’ ve got their number now . All a publisher has to do is to write cheques at intervals , while a lot of deserving and industrious chappies rally round and do the real work . I know , because I ’ ve been one myself . I simply sat tight in the old apartment with a fountain-pen , and in due season a topping , shiny book came along . I happened to be down at Corky ’ s place when the first copies of _The Children ’ s Book of American Birds_ bobbed up . Muriel Singer was there , and we were talking of things in general when there was a bang at the door and the parcel was delivered . It was certainly some book . It had a red cover with a fowl of some species on it , and underneath the girl ’ s name in gold letters . I opened a copy at random . “ Often of a spring morning , ” it said at the top of page twenty-one , “ as you wander through the fields , you will hear the sweet-toned , carelessly flowing warble of the purple finch linnet . When you are older you must read all about him in Mr. Alexander Worple ’ s wonderful book—_American Birds_. ” You see . A boost for the uncle right away . And only a few pages later there he was in the limelight again in connection with the yellow-billed cuckoo . It was great stuff . The more I read , the more I admired the chap who had written it and Jeeves ’ s genius in putting us on to the wheeze . I didn ’ t see how the uncle could fail to drop . You can ’ t call a chap the world ’ s greatest authority on the yellow-billed cuckoo without rousing a certain disposition towards chumminess in him . “ It ’ s a cert ! ” I said . “ An absolute cinch ! ” said Corky . And a day or two later he meandered up the Avenue to my apartment to tell me that all was well . The uncle had written Muriel a letter so dripping with the milk of human kindness that if he hadn ’ t known Mr. Worple ’ s handwriting Corky would have refused to believe him the author of it . Any time it suited Miss Singer to call , said the uncle , he would be delighted to make her acquaintance . Shortly after this I had to go out of town . Divers sound sportsmen had invited me to pay visits to their country places , and it wasn ’ t for several months that I settled down in the city again . I had been wondering a lot , of course , about Corky , whether it all turned out right , and so forth , and my first evening in New York , happening to pop into a quiet sort of little restaurant which I go to when I don ’ t feel inclined for the bright lights , I found Muriel Singer there , sitting by herself at a table near the door . Corky , I took it , was out telephoning . I went up and passed the time of day . “ Well , well , well , what ? ” I said . “ Why , Mr. Wooster ! How do you do ? ” “ Corky around ? ” “ I beg your pardon ? ” “ You ’ re waiting for Corky , aren ’ t you ? ” “ Oh , I didn ’ t understand . No , I ’ m not waiting for him. ” It seemed to me that there was a sort of something in her voice , a kind of thingummy , you know . “ I say , you haven ’ t had a row with Corky , have you ? ” “ A row ? ” “ A spat , don ’ t you know—little misunderstanding—faults on both sides—er—and all that sort of thing. ” “ Why , whatever makes you think that ? ” “ Oh , well , as it were , what ? What I mean is—I thought you usually dined with him before you went to the theatre. ” “ I ’ ve left the stage now. ” Suddenly the whole thing dawned on me . I had forgotten what a long time I had been away . “ Why , of course , I see now ! You ’ re married ! ” “ Yes. ” “ How perfectly topping ! I wish you all kinds of happiness. ” “ Thank you , so much . Oh Alexander , ” she said , looking past me , “ this is a friend of mine—Mr . Wooster. ” I spun round . A chappie with a lot of stiff grey hair and a red sort of healthy face was standing there . Rather a formidable Johnnie , he looked , though quite peaceful at the moment . “ I want you to meet my husband , Mr. Wooster . Mr. Wooster is a friend of Bruce ’ s , Alexander. ” The old boy grasped my hand warmly , and that was all that kept me from hitting the floor in a heap . The place was rocking . Absolutely . “ So you know my nephew , Mr. Wooster , ” I heard him say . “ I wish you would try to knock a little sense into him and make him quit this playing at painting . But I have an idea that he is steadying down . I noticed it first that night he came to dinner with us , my dear , to be introduced to you . He seemed altogether quieter and more serious . Something seemed to have sobered him . Perhaps you will give us the pleasure of your company at dinner to-night , Mr. Wooster ? Or have you dined ? ” I said I had . What I needed then was air , not dinner . I felt that I wanted to get into the open and think this thing out . When I reached my apartment I heard Jeeves moving about in his lair . I called him . “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party . A stiff b.-and-s. first of all , and then I ’ ve a bit of news for you. ” He came back with a tray and a long glass . “ Better have one yourself , Jeeves . You ’ ll need it. ” “ Later on , perhaps , thank you , sir. ” “ All right . Please yourself . But you ’ re going to get a shock . You remember my friend , Mr. Corcoran ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And the girl who was to slide gracefully into his uncle ’ s esteem by writing the book on birds ? ” “ Perfectly , sir. ” “ Well , she ’ s slid . She ’ s married the uncle. ” He took it without blinking . You can ’ t rattle Jeeves . “ That was always a development to be feared , sir. ” “ You don ’ t mean to tell me that you were expecting it ? ” “ It crossed my mind as a possibility. ” “ Did it , by Jove ! Well , I think , you might have warned us ! ” “ I hardly liked to take the liberty , sir. ” Of course , as I saw after I had had a bite to eat and was in a calmer frame of mind , what had happened wasn ’ t my fault , if you come down to it . I couldn ’ t be expected to foresee that the scheme , in itself a cracker-jack , would skid into the ditch as it had done ; but all the same I ’ m bound to admit that I didn ’ t relish the idea of meeting Corky again until time , the great healer , had been able to get in a bit of soothing work . I cut Washington Square out absolutely for the next few months . I gave it the complete miss-in-baulk . And then , just when I was beginning to think I might safely pop down in that direction and gather up the dropped threads , so to speak , time , instead of working the healing wheeze , went and pulled the most awful bone and put the lid on it . Opening the paper one morning , I read that Mrs. Alexander Worple had presented her husband with a son and heir . I was so darned sorry for poor old Corky that I hadn ’ t the heart to touch my breakfast . I told Jeeves to drink it himself . I was bowled over . Absolutely . It was the limit . I hardly knew what to do . I wanted , of course , to rush down to Washington Square and grip the poor blighter silently by the hand ; and then , thinking it over , I hadn ’ t the nerve . Absent treatment seemed the touch . I gave it him in waves . But after a month or so I began to hesitate again . It struck me that it was playing it a bit low-down on the poor chap , avoiding him like this just when he probably wanted his pals to surge round him most . I pictured him sitting in his lonely studio with no company but his bitter thoughts , and the pathos of it got me to such an extent that I bounded straight into a taxi and told the driver to go all out for the studio . I rushed in , and there was Corky , hunched up at the easel , painting away , while on the model throne sat a severe-looking female of middle age , holding a baby . A fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing . “ Oh , ah ! ” I said , and started to back out . Corky looked over his shoulder . “ Halloa , Bertie . Don ’ t go . We ’ re just finishing for the day . That will be all this afternoon , ” he said to the nurse , who got up with the baby and decanted it into a perambulator which was standing in the fairway . “ At the same hour to-morrow , Mr. Corcoran ? ” “ Yes , please. ” “ Good afternoon. ” “ Good afternoon. ” Corky stood there , looking at the door , and then he turned to me and began to get it off his chest . Fortunately , he seemed to take it for granted that I knew all about what had happened , so it wasn ’ t as awkward as it might have been . “ It ’ s my uncle ’ s idea , ” he said . “ Muriel doesn ’ t know about it yet . The portrait ’ s to be a surprise for her on her birthday . The nurse takes the kid out ostensibly to get a breather , and they beat it down here . If you want an instance of the irony of fate , Bertie , get acquainted with this . Here ’ s the first commission I have ever had to paint a portrait , and the sitter is that human poached egg that has butted in and bounced me out of my inheritance . Can you beat it ! I call it rubbing the thing in to expect me to spend my afternoons gazing into the ugly face of a little brat who to all intents and purposes has hit me behind the ear with a blackjack and swiped all I possess . I can ’ t refuse to paint the portrait because if I did my uncle would stop my allowance ; yet every time I look up and catch that kid ’ s vacant eye , I suffer agonies . I tell you , Bertie , sometimes when he gives me a patronizing glance and then turns away and is sick , as if it revolted him to look at me , I come within an ace of occupying the entire front page of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation . There are moments when I can almost see the headlines : ‘ Promising Young Artist Beans Baby With Axe. ’ ” I patted his shoulder silently . My sympathy for the poor old scout was too deep for words . I kept away from the studio for some time after that , because it didn ’ t seem right to me to intrude on the poor chappie ’ s sorrow . Besides , I ’ m bound to say that nurse intimidated me . She reminded me so infernally of Aunt Agatha . She was the same gimlet-eyed type . But one afternoon Corky called me on the ’ phone . “ Bertie. ” “ Halloa ? ” “ Are you doing anything this afternoon ? ” “ Nothing special. ” “ You couldn ’ t come down here , could you ? ” “ What ’ s the trouble ? Anything up ? ” “ I ’ ve finished the portrait. ” “ Good boy ! Stout work ! ” “ Yes. ” His voice sounded rather doubtful . “ The fact is , Bertie , it doesn ’ t look quite right to me . There ’ s something about it—My uncle ’ s coming in half an hour to inspect it , and—I don ’ t know why it is , but I kind of feel I ’ d like your moral support ! ” I began to see that I was letting myself in for something . The sympathetic co-operation of Jeeves seemed to me to be indicated . “ You think he ’ ll cut up rough ? ” “ He may. ” I threw my mind back to the red-faced chappie I had met at the restaurant , and tried to picture him cutting up rough . It was only too easy . I spoke to Corky firmly on the telephone . “ I ’ ll come , ” I said . “ Good ! ” “ But only if I may bring Jeeves ! ” “ Why Jeeves ? What ’ s Jeeves got to do with it ? Who wants Jeeves ? Jeeves is the fool who suggested the scheme that has led—— ” “ Listen , Corky , old top ! If you think I am going to face that uncle of yours without Jeeves ’ s support , you ’ re mistaken . I ’ d sooner go into a den of wild beasts and bite a lion on the back of the neck. ” “ Oh , all right , ” said Corky . Not cordially , but he said it ; so I rang for Jeeves , and explained the situation . “ Very good , sir , ” said Jeeves . That ’ s the sort of chap he is . You can ’ t rattle him . We found Corky near the door , looking at the picture , with one hand up in a defensive sort of way , as if he thought it might swing on him . “ Stand right where you are , Bertie , ” he said , without moving . “ Now , tell me honestly , how does it strike you ? ” The light from the big window fell right on the picture . I took a good look at it . Then I shifted a bit nearer and took another look . Then I went back to where I had been at first , because it hadn ’ t seemed quite so bad from there . “ Well ? ” said Corky , anxiously . I hesitated a bit . “ Of course , old man , I only saw the kid once , and then only for a moment , but—but it _was_ an ugly sort of kid , wasn ’ t it , if I remember rightly ? ” “ As ugly as that ? ” I looked again , and honesty compelled me to be frank . “ I don ’ t see how it could have been , old chap. ” Poor old Corky ran his fingers through his hair in a temperamental sort of way . He groaned . “ You ’ re right quite , Bertie . Something ’ s gone wrong with the darned thing . My private impression is that , without knowing it , I ’ ve worked that stunt that Sargent and those fellows pull—painting the soul of the sitter . I ’ ve got through the mere outward appearance , and have put the child ’ s soul on canvas. ” “ But could a child of that age have a soul like that ? I don ’ t see how he could have managed it in the time . What do you think , Jeeves ? ” “ I doubt it , sir. ” “ It—it sorts of leers at you , doesn ’ t it ? ” “ You ’ ve noticed that , too ? ” said Corky . “ I don ’ t see how one could help noticing. ” “ All I tried to do was to give the little brute a cheerful expression . But , as it worked out , he looks positively dissipated. ” “ Just what I was going to suggest , old man . He looks as if he were in the middle of a colossal spree , and enjoying every minute of it . Don ’ t you think so , Jeeves ? ” “ He has a decidedly inebriated air , sir. ” Corky was starting to say something when the door opened , and the uncle came in . For about three seconds all was joy , jollity , and goodwill . The old boy shook hands with me , slapped Corky on the back , said that he didn ’ t think he had ever seen such a fine day , and whacked his leg with his stick . Jeeves had projected himself into the background , and he didn ’ t notice him . “ Well , Bruce , my boy ; so the portrait is really finished , is it—really finished ? Well , bring it out . Let ’ s have a look at it . This will be a wonderful surprise for your aunt . Where is it ? Let ’ s—— ” And then he got it—suddenly , when he wasn ’ t set for the punch ; and he rocked back on his heels . “ Oosh ! ” he exclaimed . And for perhaps a minute there was one of the scaliest silences I ’ ve ever run up against . “ Is this a practical joke ? ” he said at last , in a way that set about sixteen draughts cutting through the room at once . I thought it was up to me to rally round old Corky . “ You want to stand a bit farther away from it , ” I said . “ You ’ re perfectly right ! ” he snorted . “ I do ! I want to stand so far away from it that I can ’ t see the thing with a telescope ! ” He turned on Corky like an untamed tiger of the jungle who has just located a chunk of meat . “ And this—this—is what you have been wasting your time and my money for all these years ! A painter ! I wouldn ’ t let you paint a house of mine ! I gave you this commission , thinking that you were a competent worker , and this—this—this extract from a comic coloured supplement is the result ! ” He swung towards the door , lashing his tail and growling to himself . “ This ends it ! If you wish to continue this foolery of pretending to be an artist because you want an excuse for idleness , please yourself . But let me tell you this . Unless you report at my office on Monday morning , prepared to abandon all this idiocy and start in at the bottom of the business to work your way up , as you should have done half a dozen years ago , not another cent—not another cent—not another—Boosh ! ” Then the door closed , and he was no longer with us . And I crawled out of the bombproof shelter . “ Corky , old top ! ” I whispered faintly . Corky was standing staring at the picture . His face was set . There was a hunted look in his eye . “ Well , that finishes it ! ” he muttered brokenly . “ What are you going to do ? ” “ Do ? What can I do ? I can ’ t stick on here if he cuts off supplies . You heard what he said . I shall have to go to the office on Monday. ” I couldn ’ t think of a thing to say . I knew exactly how he felt about the office . I don ’ t know when I ’ ve been so infernally uncomfortable . It was like hanging round trying to make conversation to a pal who ’ s just been sentenced to twenty years in quod . And then a soothing voice broke the silence . “ If I might make a suggestion , sir ! ” It was Jeeves . He had slid from the shadows and was gazing gravely at the picture . Upon my word , I can ’ t give you a better idea of the shattering effect of Corky ’ s uncle Alexander when in action than by saying that he had absolutely made me forget for the moment that Jeeves was there . “ I wonder if I have ever happened to mention to you , sir , a Mr. Digby Thistleton , with whom I was once in service ? Perhaps you have met him ? He was a financier . He is now Lord Bridgnorth . It was a favourite saying of his that there is always a way . The first time I heard him use the expression was after the failure of a patent depilatory which he promoted. ” “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ what on earth are you talking about ? ” “ I mentioned Mr. Thistleton , sir , because his was in some respects a parallel case to the present one . His depilatory failed , but he did not despair . He put it on the market again under the name of Hair-o , guaranteed to produce a full crop of hair in a few months . It was advertised , if you remember , sir , by a humorous picture of a billiard-ball , before and after taking , and made such a substantial fortune that Mr. Thistleton was soon afterwards elevated to the peerage for services to his Party . It seems to me that , if Mr. Corcoran looks into the matter , he will find , like Mr. Thistleton , that there is always a way . Mr. Worple himself suggested the solution of the difficulty . In the heat of the moment he compared the portrait to an extract from a coloured comic supplement . I consider the suggestion a very valuable one , sir . Mr. Corcoran ’ s portrait may not have pleased Mr. Worple as a likeness of his only child , but I have no doubt that editors would gladly consider it as a foundation for a series of humorous drawings . If Mr. Corcoran will allow me to make the suggestion , his talent has always been for the humorous . There is something about this picture—something bold and vigorous , which arrests the attention . I feel sure it would be highly popular. ” Corky was glaring at the picture , and making a sort of dry , sucking noise with his mouth . He seemed completely overwrought . And then suddenly he began to laugh in a wild way . “ Corky , old man ! ” I said , massaging him tenderly . I feared the poor blighter was hysterical . He began to stagger about all over the floor . “ He ’ s right ! The man ’ s absolutely right ! Jeeves , you ’ re a life-saver ! You ’ ve hit on the greatest idea of the age ! Report at the office on Monday ! Start at the bottom of the business ! I ’ ll buy the business if I feel like it . I know the man who runs the comic section of the _Sunday Star_ . He ’ ll eat this thing . He was telling me only the other day how hard it was to get a good new series . He ’ ll give me anything I ask for a real winner like this . I ’ ve got a gold-mine . Where ’ s my hat ? I ’ ve got an income for life ! Where ’ s that confounded hat ? Lend me a fiver , Bertie . I want to take a taxi down to Park Row ! ” Jeeves smiled paternally . Or , rather , he had a kind of paternal muscular spasm about the mouth , which is the nearest he ever gets to smiling . “ If I might make the suggestion , Mr. Corcoran—for a title of the series which you have in mind— ‘ The Adventures of Baby Blobbs. ’ ” Corky and I looked at the picture , then at each other in an awed way . Jeeves was right . There could be no other title . “ Jeeves , ” I said . It was a few weeks later , and I had just finished looking at the comic section of the _Sunday Star_ . “ I ’ m an optimist . I always have been . The older I get , the more I agree with Shakespeare and those poet Johnnies about it always being darkest before the dawn and there ’ s a silver lining and what you lose on the swings you make up on the roundabouts . Look at Mr. Corcoran , for instance . There was a fellow , one would have said , clear up to the eyebrows in the soup . To all appearances he had got it right in the neck . Yet look at him now . Have you seen these pictures ? ” “ I took the liberty of glancing at them before bringing them to you , sir . Extremely diverting. ” “ They have made a big hit , you know. ” “ I anticipated it , sir. ” I leaned back against the pillows . “ You know , Jeeves , you ’ re a genius . You ought to be drawing a commission on these things. ” “ I have nothing to complain of in that respect , sir . Mr. Corcoran has been most generous . I am putting out the brown suit , sir. ” “ No , I think I ’ ll wear the blue with the faint red stripe. ” “ Not the blue with the faint red stripe , sir. ” “ But I rather fancy myself in it. ” “ Not the blue with the faint red stripe , sir. ” “ Oh , all right , have it your own way. ” “ Very good , sir . Thank you , sir. ” Of course , I know it ’ s as bad as being henpecked ; but then Jeeves is always right . You ’ ve got to consider that , you know . What ? JEEVES AND THE UNBIDDEN GUEST I ’ m not absolutely certain of my facts , but I rather fancy it ’ s Shakespeare—or , if not , it ’ s some equally brainy lad—who says that it ’ s always just when a chappie is feeling particularly top-hole , and more than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping . There ’ s no doubt the man ’ s right . It ’ s absolutely that way with me . Take , for instance , the fairly rummy matter of Lady Malvern and her son Wilmot . A moment before they turned up , I was just thinking how thoroughly all right everything was . It was one of those topping mornings , and I had just climbed out from under the cold shower , feeling like a two-year-old . As a matter of fact , I was especially bucked just then because the day before I had asserted myself with Jeeves—absolutely asserted myself , don ’ t you know . You see , the way things had been going on I was rapidly becoming a dashed serf . The man had jolly well oppressed me . I didn ’ t so much mind when he made me give up one of my new suits , because , Jeeves ’ s judgment about suits is sound . But I as near as a toucher rebelled when he wouldn ’ t let me wear a pair of cloth-topped boots which I loved like a couple of brothers . And when he tried to tread on me like a worm in the matter of a hat , I jolly well put my foot down and showed him who was who . It ’ s a long story , and I haven ’ t time to tell you now , but the point is that he wanted me to wear the Longacre—as worn by John Drew—when I had set my heart on the Country Gentleman—as worn by another famous actor chappie—and the end of the matter was that , after a rather painful scene , I bought the Country Gentleman . So that ’ s how things stood on this particular morning , and I was feeling kind of manly and independent . Well , I was in the bathroom , wondering what there was going to be for breakfast while I massaged the good old spine with a rough towel and sang slightly , when there was a tap at the door . I stopped singing and opened the door an inch . “ What ho without there ! ” “ Lady Malvern wishes to see you , sir , ” said Jeeves . “ Eh ? ” “ Lady Malvern , sir . She is waiting in the sitting-room. ” “ Pull yourself together , Jeeves , my man , ” I said , rather severely , for I bar practical jokes before breakfast . “ You know perfectly well there ’ s no one waiting for me in the sitting-room . How could there be when it ’ s barely ten o ’ clock yet ? ” “ I gathered from her ladyship , sir , that she had landed from an ocean liner at an early hour this morning. ” This made the thing a bit more plausible . I remembered that when I had arrived in America about a year before , the proceedings had begun at some ghastly hour like six , and that I had been shot out on to a foreign shore considerably before eight . “ Who the deuce is Lady Malvern , Jeeves ? ” “ Her ladyship did not confide in me , sir. ” “ Is she alone ? ” “ Her ladyship is accompanied by a Lord Pershore , sir . I fancy that his lordship would be her ladyship ’ s son. ” “ Oh , well , put out rich raiment of sorts , and I ’ ll be dressing. ” “ Our heather-mixture lounge is in readiness , sir. ” “ Then lead me to it. ” While I was dressing I kept trying to think who on earth Lady Malvern could be . It wasn ’ t till I had climbed through the top of my shirt and was reaching out for the studs that I remembered . “ I ’ ve placed her , Jeeves . She ’ s a pal of my Aunt Agatha. ” “ Indeed , sir ? ” “ Yes . I met her at lunch one Sunday before I left London . A very vicious specimen . Writes books . She wrote a book on social conditions in India when she came back from the Durbar. ” “ Yes , sir ? Pardon me , sir , but not that tie ! ” “ Eh ? ” “ Not that tie with the heather-mixture lounge , sir ! ” It was a shock to me . I thought I had quelled the fellow . It was rather a solemn moment . What I mean is , if I weakened now , all my good work the night before would be thrown away . I braced myself . “ What ’ s wrong with this tie ? I ’ ve seen you give it a nasty look before . Speak out like a man ! What ’ s the matter with it ? ” “ Too ornate , sir. ” “ Nonsense ! A cheerful pink . Nothing more. ” “ Unsuitable , sir. ” “ Jeeves , this is the tie I wear ! ” “ Very good , sir. ” Dashed unpleasant . I could see that the man was wounded . But I was firm . I tied the tie , got into the coat and waistcoat , and went into the sitting-room . “ Halloa ! Halloa ! Halloa ! ” I said . “ What ? ” “ Ah ! How do you do , Mr. Wooster ? You have never met my son , Wilmot , I think ? Motty , darling , this is Mr. Wooster. ” Lady Malvern was a hearty , happy , healthy , overpowering sort of dashed female , not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feet from the O.P . to the Prompt Side . She fitted into my biggest arm-chair as if it had been built round her by someone who knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season . She had bright , bulging eyes and a lot of yellow hair , and when she spoke she showed about fifty-seven front teeth . She was one of those women who kind of numb a fellow ’ s faculties . She made me feel as if I were ten years old and had been brought into the drawing-room in my Sunday clothes to say how-d ’ you-do . Altogether by no means the sort of thing a chappie would wish to find in his sitting-room before breakfast . Motty , the son , was about twenty-three , tall and thin and meek-looking . He had the same yellow hair as his mother , but he wore it plastered down and parted in the middle . His eyes bulged , too , but they weren ’ t bright . They were a dull grey with pink rims . His chin gave up the struggle about half-way down , and he didn ’ t appear to have any eyelashes . A mild , furtive , sheepish sort of blighter , in short . “ Awfully glad to see you , ” I said . “ So you ’ ve popped over , eh ? Making a long stay in America ? ” “ About a month . Your aunt gave me your address and told me to be sure and call on you. ” I was glad to hear this , as it showed that Aunt Agatha was beginning to come round a bit . There had been some unpleasantness a year before , when she had sent me over to New York to disentangle my Cousin Gussie from the clutches of a girl on the music-hall stage . When I tell you that by the time I had finished my operations , Gussie had not only married the girl but had gone on the stage himself , and was doing well , you ’ ll understand that Aunt Agatha was upset to no small extent . I simply hadn ’ t dared go back and face her , and it was a relief to find that time had healed the wound and all that sort of thing enough to make her tell her pals to look me up . What I mean is , much as I liked America , I didn ’ t want to have England barred to me for the rest of my natural ; and , believe me , England is a jolly sight too small for anyone to live in with Aunt Agatha , if she ’ s really on the warpath . So I braced on hearing these kind words and smiled genially on the assemblage . “ Your aunt said that you would do anything that was in your power to be of assistance to us. ” “ Rather ? Oh , rather ! Absolutely ! ” “ Thank you so much . I want you to put dear Motty up for a little while. ” I didn ’ t get this for a moment . “ Put him up ? For my clubs ? ” “ No , no ! Darling Motty is essentially a home bird . Aren ’ t you , Motty darling ? ” Motty , who was sucking the knob of his stick , uncorked himself . “ Yes , mother , ” he said , and corked himself up again . “ I should not like him to belong to clubs . I mean put him up here . Have him to live with you while I am away. ” These frightful words trickled out of her like honey . The woman simply didn ’ t seem to understand the ghastly nature of her proposal . I gave Motty the swift east-to-west . He was sitting with his mouth nuzzling the stick , blinking at the wall . The thought of having this planted on me for an indefinite period appalled me . Absolutely appalled me , don ’ t you know . I was just starting to say that the shot wasn ’ t on the board at any price , and that the first sign Motty gave of trying to nestle into my little home I would yell for the police , when she went on , rolling placidly over me , as it were . There was something about this woman that sapped a chappie ’ s will-power . “ I am leaving New York by the midday train , as I have to pay a visit to Sing-Sing prison . I am extremely interested in prison conditions in America . After that I work my way gradually across to the coast , visiting the points of interest on the journey . You see , Mr. Wooster , I am in America principally on business . No doubt you read my book , _India and the Indians_ ? My publishers are anxious for me to write a companion volume on the United States . I shall not be able to spend more than a month in the country , as I have to get back for the season , but a month should be ample . I was less than a month in India , and my dear friend Sir Roger Cremorne wrote his _America from Within_ after a stay of only two weeks . I should love to take dear Motty with me , but the poor boy gets so sick when he travels by train . I shall have to pick him up on my return. ” From where I sat I could see Jeeves in the dining-room , laying the breakfast-table . I wished I could have had a minute with him alone . I felt certain that he would have been able to think of some way of putting a stop to this woman . “ It will be such a relief to know that Motty is safe with you , Mr. Wooster . I know what the temptations of a great city are . Hitherto dear Motty has been sheltered from them . He has lived quietly with me in the country . I know that you will look after him carefully , Mr. Wooster . He will give very little trouble. ” She talked about the poor blighter as if he wasn ’ t there . Not that Motty seemed to mind . He had stopped chewing his walking-stick and was sitting there with his mouth open . “ He is a vegetarian and a teetotaller and is devoted to reading . Give him a nice book and he will be quite contented. ” She got up . “ Thank you so much , Mr. Wooster ! I don ’ t know what I should have done without your help . Come , Motty ! We have just time to see a few of the sights before my train goes . But I shall have to rely on you for most of my information about New York , darling . Be sure to keep your eyes open and take notes of your impressions ! It will be such a help . Good-bye , Mr. Wooster . I will send Motty back early in the afternoon. ” They went out , and I howled for Jeeves . “ Jeeves ! What about it ? ” “ Sir ? ” “ What ’ s to be done ? You heard it all , didn ’ t you ? You were in the dining-room most of the time . That pill is coming to stay here. ” “ Pill , sir ? ” “ The excrescence. ” “ I beg your pardon , sir ? ” I looked at Jeeves sharply . This sort of thing wasn ’ t like him . It was as if he were deliberately trying to give me the pip . Then I understood . The man was really upset about that tie . He was trying to get his own back . “ Lord Pershore will be staying here from to-night , Jeeves , ” I said coldly . “ Very good , sir . Breakfast is ready , sir. ” I could have sobbed into the bacon and eggs . That there wasn ’ t any sympathy to be got out of Jeeves was what put the lid on it . For a moment I almost weakened and told him to destroy the hat and tie if he didn ’ t like them , but I pulled myself together again . I was dashed if I was going to let Jeeves treat me like a bally one-man chain-gang ! But , what with brooding on Jeeves and brooding on Motty , I was in a pretty reduced sort of state . The more I examined the situation , the more blighted it became . There was nothing I could do . If I slung Motty out , he would report to his mother , and she would pass it on to Aunt Agatha , and I didn ’ t like to think what would happen then . Sooner or later , I should be wanting to go back to England , and I didn ’ t want to get there and find Aunt Agatha waiting on the quay for me with a stuffed eelskin . There was absolutely nothing for it but to put the fellow up and make the best of it . About midday Motty ’ s luggage arrived , and soon afterward a large parcel of what I took to be nice books . I brightened up a little when I saw it . It was one of those massive parcels and looked as if it had enough in it to keep the chappie busy for a year . I felt a trifle more cheerful , and I got my Country Gentleman hat and stuck it on my head , and gave the pink tie a twist , and reeled out to take a bite of lunch with one or two of the lads at a neighbouring hostelry ; and what with excellent browsing and sluicing and cheery conversation and what-not , the afternoon passed quite happily . By dinner-time I had almost forgotten blighted Motty ’ s existence . I dined at the club and looked in at a show afterward , and it wasn ’ t till fairly late that I got back to the flat . There were no signs of Motty , and I took it that he had gone to bed . It seemed rummy to me , though , that the parcel of nice books was still there with the string and paper on it . It looked as if Motty , after seeing mother off at the station , had decided to call it a day . Jeeves came in with the nightly whisky-and-soda . I could tell by the chappie ’ s manner that he was still upset . “ Lord Pershore gone to bed , Jeeves ? ” I asked , with reserved hauteur and what-not . “ No , sir . His lordship has not yet returned. ” “ Not returned ? What do you mean ? ” “ His lordship came in shortly after six-thirty , and , having dressed , went out again. ” At this moment there was a noise outside the front door , a sort of scrabbling noise , as if somebody were trying to paw his way through the woodwork . Then a sort of thud . “ Better go and see what that is , Jeeves. ” “ Very good , sir. ” He went out and came back again . “ If you would not mind stepping this way , sir , I think we might be able to carry him in. ” “ Carry him in ? ” “ His lordship is lying on the mat , sir. ” I went to the front door . The man was right . There was Motty huddled up outside on the floor . He was moaning a bit . “ He ’ s had some sort of dashed fit , ” I said . I took another look . “ Jeeves ! Someone ’ s been feeding him meat ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ He ’ s a vegetarian , you know . He must have been digging into a steak or something . Call up a doctor ! ” “ I hardly think it will be necessary , sir . If you would take his lordship ’ s legs , while I—— ” “ Great Scot , Jeeves ! You don ’ t think—he can ’ t be—— ” “ I am inclined to think so , sir. ” And , by Jove , he was right ! Once on the right track , you couldn ’ t mistake it . Motty was under the surface . It was the deuce of a shock . “ You never can tell , Jeeves ! ” “ Very seldom , sir. ” “ Remove the eye of authority and where are you ? ” “ Precisely , sir. ” “ Where is my wandering boy to-night and all that sort of thing , what ? ” “ It would seem so , sir. ” “ Well , we had better bring him in , eh ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” So we lugged him in , and Jeeves put him to bed , and I lit a cigarette and sat down to think the thing over . I had a kind of foreboding . It seemed to me that I had let myself in for something pretty rocky . Next morning , after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea , I went into Motty ’ s room to investigate . I expected to find the fellow a wreck , but there he was , sitting up in bed , quite chirpy , reading Gingery stories . “ What ho ! ” I said . “ What ho ! ” said Motty . “ What ho ! What ho ! ” “ What ho ! What ho ! What ho ! ” After that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation . “ How are you feeling this morning ? ” I asked . “ Topping ! ” replied Motty , blithely and with abandon . “ I say , you know , that fellow of yours—Jeeves , you know—is a corker . I had a most frightful headache when I woke up , and he brought me a sort of rummy dark drink , and it put me right again at once . Said it was his own invention . I must see more of that lad . He seems to me distinctly one of the ones ! ” I couldn ’ t believe that this was the same blighter who had sat and sucked his stick the day before . “ You ate something that disagreed with you last night , didn ’ t you ? ” I said , by way of giving him a chance to slide out of it if he wanted to . But he wouldn ’ t have it , at any price . “ No ! ” he replied firmly . “ I didn ’ t do anything of the kind . I drank too much ! Much too much . Lots and lots too much ! And , what ’ s more , I ’ m going to do it again ! I ’ m going to do it every night . If ever you see me sober , old top , ” he said , with a kind of holy exaltation , “ tap me on the shoulder and say , ‘ Tut ! Tut ! ’ and I ’ ll apologize and remedy the defect. ” “ But I say , you know , what about me ? ” “ What about you ? ” “ Well , I ’ m so to speak , as it were , kind of responsible for you . What I mean to say is , if you go doing this sort of thing I ’ m apt to get in the soup somewhat. ” “ I can ’ t help your troubles , ” said Motty firmly . “ Listen to me , old thing : this is the first time in my life that I ’ ve had a real chance to yield to the temptations of a great city . What ’ s the use of a great city having temptations if fellows don ’ t yield to them ? Makes it so bally discouraging for a great city . Besides , mother told me to keep my eyes open and collect impressions. ” I sat on the edge of the bed . I felt dizzy . “ I know just how you feel , old dear , ” said Motty consolingly . “ And , if my principles would permit it , I would simmer down for your sake . But duty first ! This is the first time I ’ ve been let out alone , and I mean to make the most of it . We ’ re only young once . Why interfere with life ’ s morning ? Young man , rejoice in thy youth ! Tra-la ! What ho ! ” Put like that , it did seem reasonable . “ All my bally life , dear boy , ” Motty went on , “ I ’ ve been cooped up in the ancestral home at Much Middlefold , in Shropshire , and till you ’ ve been cooped up in Much Middlefold you don ’ t know what cooping is ! The only time we get any excitement is when one of the choir-boys is caught sucking chocolate during the sermon . When that happens , we talk about it for days . I ’ ve got about a month of New York , and I mean to store up a few happy memories for the long winter evenings . This is my only chance to collect a past , and I ’ m going to do it . Now tell me , old sport , as man to man , how does one get in touch with that very decent chappie Jeeves ? Does one ring a bell or shout a bit ? I should like to discuss the subject of a good stiff b.-and-s. with him ! ” I had had a sort of vague idea , don ’ t you know , that if I stuck close to Motty and went about the place with him , I might act as a bit of a damper on the gaiety . What I mean is , I thought that if , when he was being the life and soul of the party , he were to catch my reproving eye he might ease up a trifle on the revelry . So the next night I took him along to supper with me . It was the last time . I ’ m a quiet , peaceful sort of chappie who has lived all his life in London , and I can ’ t stand the pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set . What I mean to say is this , I ’ m all for rational enjoyment and so forth , but I think a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws soft-boiled eggs at the electric fan . And decent mirth and all that sort of thing are all right , but I do bar dancing on tables and having to dash all over the place dodging waiters , managers , and chuckers-out , just when you want to sit still and digest . Directly I managed to tear myself away that night and get home , I made up my mind that this was jolly well the last time that I went about with Motty . The only time I met him late at night after that was once when I passed the door of a fairly low-down sort of restaurant and had to step aside to dodge him as he sailed through the air _en route_ for the opposite pavement , with a muscular sort of looking chappie peering out after him with a kind of gloomy satisfaction . In a way , I couldn ’ t help sympathizing with the fellow . He had about four weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over about ten years , and I didn ’ t wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy . I should have been just the same in his place . Still , there was no denying that it was a bit thick . If it hadn ’ t been for the thought of Lady Malvern and Aunt Agatha in the background , I should have regarded Motty ’ s rapid work with an indulgent smile . But I couldn ’ t get rid of the feeling that , sooner or later , I was the lad who was scheduled to get it behind the ear . And what with brooding on this prospect , and sitting up in the old flat waiting for the familiar footstep , and putting it to bed when it got there , and stealing into the sick-chamber next morning to contemplate the wreckage , I was beginning to lose weight . Absolutely becoming the good old shadow , I give you my honest word . Starting at sudden noises and what-not . And no sympathy from Jeeves . That was what cut me to the quick . The man was still thoroughly pipped about the hat and tie , and simply wouldn ’ t rally round . One morning I wanted comforting so much that I sank the pride of the Woosters and appealed to the fellow direct . “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ this is getting a bit thick ! ” “ Sir ? ” Business and cold respectfulness . “ You know what I mean . This lad seems to have chucked all the principles of a well-spent boyhood . He has got it up his nose ! ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Well , I shall get blamed , don ’ t you know . You know what my Aunt Agatha is ! ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Very well , then. ” I waited a moment , but he wouldn ’ t unbend . “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ haven ’ t you any scheme up your sleeve for coping with this blighter ? ” “ No , sir. ” And he shimmered off to his lair . Obstinate devil ! So dashed absurd , don ’ t you know . It wasn ’ t as if there was anything wrong with that Country Gentleman hat . It was a remarkably priceless effort , and much admired by the lads . But , just because he preferred the Longacre , he left me flat . It was shortly after this that young Motty got the idea of bringing pals back in the small hours to continue the gay revels in the home . This was where I began to crack under the strain . You see , the part of town where I was living wasn ’ t the right place for that sort of thing . I knew lots of chappies down Washington Square way who started the evening at about 2 a.m.—artists and writers and what-not , who frolicked considerably till checked by the arrival of the morning milk . That was all right . They like that sort of thing down there . The neighbours can ’ t get to sleep unless there ’ s someone dancing Hawaiian dances over their heads . But on Fifty-seventh Street the atmosphere wasn ’ t right , and when Motty turned up at three in the morning with a collection of hearty lads , who only stopped singing their college song when they started singing “ The Old Oaken Bucket , ” there was a marked peevishness among the old settlers in the flats . The management was extremely terse over the telephone at breakfast-time , and took a lot of soothing . The next night I came home early , after a lonely dinner at a place which I ’ d chosen because there didn ’ t seem any chance of meeting Motty there . The sitting-room was quite dark , and I was just moving to switch on the light , when there was a sort of explosion and something collared hold of my trouser-leg . Living with Motty had reduced me to such an extent that I was simply unable to cope with this thing . I jumped backward with a loud yell of anguish , and tumbled out into the hall just as Jeeves came out of his den to see what the matter was . “ Did you call , sir ? ” “ Jeeves ! There ’ s something in there that grabs you by the leg ! ” “ That would be Rollo , sir. ” “ Eh ? ” “ I would have warned you of his presence , but I did not hear you come in . His temper is a little uncertain at present , as he has not yet settled down. ” “ Who the deuce is Rollo ? ” “ His lordship ’ s bull-terrier , sir . His lordship won him in a raffle , and tied him to the leg of the table . If you will allow me , sir , I will go in and switch on the light. ” There really is nobody like Jeeves . He walked straight into the sitting-room , the biggest feat since Daniel and the lions ’ den , without a quiver . What ’ s more , his magnetism or whatever they call it was such that the dashed animal , instead of pinning him by the leg , calmed down as if he had had a bromide , and rolled over on his back with all his paws in the air . If Jeeves had been his rich uncle he couldn ’ t have been more chummy . Yet directly he caught sight of me again , he got all worked up and seemed to have only one idea in life—to start chewing me where he had left off . “ Rollo is not used to you yet , sir , ” said Jeeves , regarding the bally quadruped in an admiring sort of way . “ He is an excellent watchdog. ” “ I don ’ t want a watchdog to keep me out of my rooms. ” “ No , sir. ” “ Well , what am I to do ? ” “ No doubt in time the animal will learn to discriminate , sir . He will learn to distinguish your peculiar scent. ” “ What do you mean—my peculiar scent ? Correct the impression that I intend to hang about in the hall while life slips by , in the hope that one of these days that dashed animal will decide that I smell all right. ” I thought for a bit . “ Jeeves ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ I ’ m going away—to-morrow morning by the first train . I shall go and stop with Mr. Todd in the country. ” “ Do you wish me to accompany you , sir ? ” “ No. ” “ Very good , sir. ” “ I don ’ t know when I shall be back . Forward my letters. ” “ Yes , sir. ” As a matter of fact , I was back within the week . Rocky Todd , the pal I went to stay with , is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone in the wilds of Long Island , and likes it ; but a little of that sort of thing goes a long way with me . Dear old Rocky is one of the best , but after a few days in his cottage in the woods , miles away from anywhere , New York , even with Motty on the premises , began to look pretty good to me . The days down on Long Island have forty-eight hours in them ; you can ’ t get to sleep at night because of the bellowing of the crickets ; and you have to walk two miles for a drink and six for an evening paper . I thanked Rocky for his kind hospitality , and caught the only train they have down in those parts . It landed me in New York about dinner-time . I went straight to the old flat . Jeeves came out of his lair . I looked round cautiously for Rollo . “ Where ’ s that dog , Jeeves ? Have you got him tied up ? ” “ The animal is no longer here , sir . His lordship gave him to the porter , who sold him . His lordship took a prejudice against the animal on account of being bitten by him in the calf of the leg. ” I don ’ t think I ’ ve ever been so bucked by a bit of news . I felt I had misjudged Rollo . Evidently , when you got to know him better , he had a lot of intelligence in him . “ Ripping ! ” I said . “ Is Lord Pershore in , Jeeves ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ Do you expect him back to dinner ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ Where is he ? ” “ In prison , sir. ” Have you ever trodden on a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you ? That ’ s how I felt then . “ In prison ! ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ You don ’ t mean—in prison ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” I lowered myself into a chair . “ Why ? ” I said . “ He assaulted a constable , sir. ” “ Lord Pershore assaulted a constable ! ” “ Yes , sir. ” I digested this . “ But , Jeeves , I say ! This is frightful ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ What will Lady Malvern say when she finds out ? ” “ I do not fancy that her ladyship will find out , sir. ” “ But she ’ ll come back and want to know where he is. ” “ I rather fancy , sir , that his lordship ’ s bit of time will have run out by then. ” “ But supposing it hasn ’ t ? ” “ In that event , sir , it may be judicious to prevaricate a little. ” “ How ? ” “ If I might make the suggestion , sir , I should inform her ladyship that his lordship has left for a short visit to Boston. ” “ Why Boston ? ” “ Very interesting and respectable centre , sir. ” “ Jeeves , I believe you ’ ve hit it. ” “ I fancy so , sir. ” “ Why , this is really the best thing that could have happened . If this hadn ’ t turned up to prevent him , young Motty would have been in a sanatorium by the time Lady Malvern got back. ” “ Exactly , sir. ” The more I looked at it in that way , the sounder this prison wheeze seemed to me . There was no doubt in the world that prison was just what the doctor ordered for Motty . It was the only thing that could have pulled him up . I was sorry for the poor blighter , but , after all , I reflected , a chappie who had lived all his life with Lady Malvern , in a small village in the interior of Shropshire , wouldn ’ t have much to kick at in a prison . Altogether , I began to feel absolutely braced again . Life became like what the poet Johnnie says—one grand , sweet song . Things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that I give you my word that I ’ d almost forgotten such a person as Motty existed . The only flaw in the scheme of things was that Jeeves was still pained and distant . It wasn ’ t anything he said or did , mind you , but there was a rummy something about him all the time . Once when I was tying the pink tie I caught sight of him in the looking-glass . There was a kind of grieved look in his eye . And then Lady Malvern came back , a good bit ahead of schedule . I hadn ’ t been expecting her for days . I ’ d forgotten how time had been slipping along . She turned up one morning while I was still in bed sipping tea and thinking of this and that . Jeeves flowed in with the announcement that he had just loosed her into the sitting-room . I draped a few garments round me and went in . There she was , sitting in the same arm-chair , looking as massive as ever . The only difference was that she didn ’ t uncover the teeth , as she had done the first time . “ Good morning , ” I said . “ So you ’ ve got back , what ? ” “ I have got back. ” There was something sort of bleak about her tone , rather as if she had swallowed an east wind . This I took to be due to the fact that she probably hadn ’ t breakfasted . It ’ s only after a bit of breakfast that I ’ m able to regard the world with that sunny cheeriness which makes a fellow the universal favourite . I ’ m never much of a lad till I ’ ve engulfed an egg or two and a beaker of coffee . “ I suppose you haven ’ t breakfasted ? ” “ I have not yet breakfasted. ” “ Won ’ t you have an egg or something ? Or a sausage or something ? Or something ? ” “ No , thank you. ” She spoke as if she belonged to an anti-sausage society or a league for the suppression of eggs . There was a bit of a silence . “ I called on you last night , ” she said , “ but you were out. ” “ Awfully sorry ! Had a pleasant trip ? ” “ Extremely , thank you. ” “ See everything ? Niag ’ ra Falls , Yellowstone Park , and the jolly old Grand Canyon , and what-not ? ” “ I saw a great deal. ” There was another slightly _frappé_ silence . Jeeves floated silently into the dining-room and began to lay the breakfast-table . “ I hope Wilmot was not in your way , Mr. Wooster ? ” I had been wondering when she was going to mention Motty . “ Rather not ! Great pals ! Hit it off splendidly. ” “ You were his constant companion , then ? ” “ Absolutely ! We were always together . Saw all the sights , don ’ t you know . We ’ d take in the Museum of Art in the morning , and have a bit of lunch at some good vegetarian place , and then toddle along to a sacred concert in the afternoon , and home to an early dinner . We usually played dominoes after dinner . And then the early bed and the refreshing sleep . We had a great time . I was awfully sorry when he went away to Boston. ” “ Oh ! Wilmot is in Boston ? ” “ Yes . I ought to have let you know , but of course we didn ’ t know where you were . You were dodging all over the place like a snipe—I mean , don ’ t you know , dodging all over the place , and we couldn ’ t get at you . Yes , Motty went off to Boston. ” “ You ’ re sure he went to Boston ? ” “ Oh , absolutely. ” I called out to Jeeves , who was now messing about in the next room with forks and so forth : “ Jeeves , Lord Pershore didn ’ t change his mind about going to Boston , did he ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ I thought I was right . Yes , Motty went to Boston. ” “ Then how do you account , Mr. Wooster , for the fact that when I went yesterday afternoon to Blackwell ’ s Island prison , to secure material for my book , I saw poor , dear Wilmot there , dressed in a striped suit , seated beside a pile of stones with a hammer in his hands ? ” I tried to think of something to say , but nothing came . A chappie has to be a lot broader about the forehead than I am to handle a jolt like this . I strained the old bean till it creaked , but between the collar and the hair parting nothing stirred . I was dumb . Which was lucky , because I wouldn ’ t have had a chance to get any persiflage out of my system . Lady Malvern collared the conversation . She had been bottling it up , and now it came out with a rush : “ So this is how you have looked after my poor , dear boy , Mr. Wooster ! So this is how you have abused my trust ! I left him in your charge , thinking that I could rely on you to shield him from evil . He came to you innocent , unversed in the ways of the world , confiding , unused to the temptations of a large city , and you led him astray ! ” I hadn ’ t any remarks to make . All I could think of was the picture of Aunt Agatha drinking all this in and reaching out to sharpen the hatchet against my return . “ You deliberately—— ” Far away in the misty distance a soft voice spoke : “ If I might explain , your ladyship. ” Jeeves had projected himself in from the dining-room and materialized on the rug . Lady Malvern tried to freeze him with a look , but you can ’ t do that sort of thing to Jeeves . He is look-proof . “ I fancy , your ladyship , that you have misunderstood Mr. Wooster , and that he may have given you the impression that he was in New York when his lordship—was removed . When Mr. Wooster informed your ladyship that his lordship had gone to Boston , he was relying on the version I had given him of his lordship ’ s movements . Mr. Wooster was away , visiting a friend in the country , at the time , and knew nothing of the matter till your ladyship informed him. ” Lady Malvern gave a kind of grunt . It didn ’ t rattle Jeeves . “ I feared Mr. Wooster might be disturbed if he knew the truth , as he is so attached to his lordship and has taken such pains to look after him , so I took the liberty of telling him that his lordship had gone away for a visit . It might have been hard for Mr. Wooster to believe that his lordship had gone to prison voluntarily and from the best motives , but your ladyship , knowing him better , will readily understand. ” “ What ! ” Lady Malvern goggled at him . “ Did you say that Lord Pershore went to prison voluntarily ? ” “ If I might explain , your ladyship . I think that your ladyship ’ s parting words made a deep impression on his lordship . I have frequently heard him speak to Mr. Wooster of his desire to do something to follow your ladyship ’ s instructions and collect material for your ladyship ’ s book on America . Mr. Wooster will bear me out when I say that his lordship was frequently extremely depressed at the thought that he was doing so little to help. ” “ Absolutely , by Jove ! Quite pipped about it ! ” I said . “ The idea of making a personal examination into the prison system of the country—from within—occurred to his lordship very suddenly one night . He embraced it eagerly . There was no restraining him. ” Lady Malvern looked at Jeeves , then at me , then at Jeeves again . I could see her struggling with the thing . “ Surely , your ladyship , ” said Jeeves , “ it is more reasonable to suppose that a gentleman of his lordship ’ s character went to prison of his own volition than that he committed some breach of the law which necessitated his arrest ? ” Lady Malvern blinked . Then she got up . “ Mr . Wooster , ” she said , “ I apologize . I have done you an injustice . I should have known Wilmot better . I should have had more faith in his pure , fine spirit. ” “ Absolutely ! ” I said . “ Your breakfast is ready , sir , ” said Jeeves . I sat down and dallied in a dazed sort of way with a poached egg . “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ you are certainly a life-saver ! ” “ Thank you , sir. ” “ Nothing would have convinced my Aunt Agatha that I hadn ’ t lured that blighter into riotous living. ” “ I fancy you are right , sir. ” I champed my egg for a bit . I was most awfully moved , don ’ t you know , by the way Jeeves had rallied round . Something seemed to tell me that this was an occasion that called for rich rewards . For a moment I hesitated . Then I made up my mind . “ Jeeves ! ” “ Sir ? ” “ That pink tie ! ” “ Yes , sir ? ” “ Burn it ! ” “ Thank you , sir. ” “ And , Jeeves ! ” “ Yes , sir ? ” “ Take a taxi and get me that Longacre hat , as worn by John Drew ! ” “ Thank you very much , sir. ” I felt most awfully braced . I felt as if the clouds had rolled away and all was as it used to be . I felt like one of those chappies in the novels who calls off the fight with his wife in the last chapter and decides to forget and forgive . I felt I wanted to do all sorts of other things to show Jeeves that I appreciated him . “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ it isn ’ t enough . Is there anything else you would like ? ” “ Yes , sir . If I may make the suggestion—fifty dollars. ” “ Fifty dollars ? ” “ It will enable me to pay a debt of honour , sir . I owe it to his lordship. ” “ You owe Lord Pershore fifty dollars ? ” “ Yes , sir . I happened to meet him in the street the night his lordship was arrested . I had been thinking a good deal about the most suitable method of inducing him to abandon his mode of living , sir . His lordship was a little over-excited at the time and I fancy that he mistook me for a friend of his . At any rate when I took the liberty of wagering him fifty dollars that he would not punch a passing policeman in the eye , he accepted the bet very cordially and won it. ” I produced my pocket-book and counted out a hundred . “ Take this , Jeeves , ” I said ; “ fifty isn ’ t enough . Do you know , Jeeves , you ’ re—well , you absolutely stand alone ! ” “ I endeavour to give satisfaction , sir , ” said Jeeves . JEEVES AND THE HARD-BOILED EGG Sometimes of a morning , as I ’ ve sat in bed sucking down the early cup of tea and watched my man Jeeves flitting about the room and putting out the raiment for the day , I ’ ve wondered what the deuce I should do if the fellow ever took it into his head to leave me . It ’ s not so bad now I ’ m in New York , but in London the anxiety was frightful . There used to be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneak him away from me . Young Reggie Foljambe to my certain knowledge offered him double what I was giving him , and Alistair Bingham-Reeves , who ’ s got a valet who had been known to press his trousers sideways , used to look at him , when he came to see me , with a kind of glittering hungry eye which disturbed me deucedly . Bally pirates ! The thing , you see , is that Jeeves is so dashed competent . You can spot it even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt . I rely on him absolutely in every crisis , and he never lets me down . And , what ’ s more , he can always be counted on to extend himself on behalf of any pal of mine who happens to be to all appearances knee-deep in the bouillon . Take the rather rummy case , for instance , of dear old Bicky and his uncle , the hard-boiled egg . It happened after I had been in America for a few months . I got back to the flat latish one night , and when Jeeves brought me the final drink he said : “ Mr . Bickersteth called to see you this evening , sir , while you were out. ” “ Oh ? ” I said . “ Twice , sir . He appeared a trifle agitated. ” “ What , pipped ? ” “ He gave that impression , sir. ” I sipped the whisky . I was sorry if Bicky was in trouble , but , as a matter of fact , I was rather glad to have something I could discuss freely with Jeeves just then , because things had been a bit strained between us for some time , and it had been rather difficult to hit on anything to talk about that wasn ’ t apt to take a personal turn . You see , I had decided—rightly or wrongly—to grow a moustache and this had cut Jeeves to the quick . He couldn ’ t stick the thing at any price , and I had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till I was getting jolly well fed up with it . What I mean is , while there ’ s no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeves ’ s judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed , it seemed to me that it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume . No one can call me an unreasonable chappie , and many ’ s the time I ’ ve given in like a lamb when Jeeves has voted against one of my pet suits or ties ; but when it comes to a valet ’ s staking out a claim on your upper lip you ’ ve simply got to have a bit of the good old bulldog pluck and defy the blighter . “ He said that he would call again later , sir. ” “ Something must be up , Jeeves. ” “ Yes , sir. ” I gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl . It seemed to hurt Jeeves a good deal , so I chucked it . “ I see by the paper , sir , that Mr. Bickersteth ’ s uncle is arriving on the _Carmantic_. ” “ Yes ? ” “ His Grace the Duke of Chiswick , sir. ” This was news to me , that Bicky ’ s uncle was a duke . Rum , how little one knows about one ’ s pals ! I had met Bicky for the first time at a species of beano or jamboree down in Washington Square , not long after my arrival in New York . I suppose I was a bit homesick at the time , and I rather took to Bicky when I found that he was an Englishman and had , in fact , been up at Oxford with me . Besides , he was a frightful chump , so we naturally drifted together ; and while we were taking a quiet snort in a corner that wasn ’ t all cluttered up with artists and sculptors and what-not , he furthermore endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarily gifted imitation of a bull-terrier chasing a cat up a tree . But , though we had subsequently become extremely pally , all I really knew about him was that he was generally hard up , and had an uncle who relieved the strain a bit from time to time by sending him monthly remittances . “ If the Duke of Chiswick is his uncle , ” I said , “ why hasn ’ t he a title ? Why isn ’ t he Lord What-Not ? ” “ Mr . Bickersteth is the son of his grace ’ s late sister , sir , who married Captain Rollo Bickersteth of the Coldstream Guards. ” Jeeves knows everything . “ Is Mr. Bickersteth ’ s father dead , too ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Leave any money ? ” “ No , sir. ” I began to understand why poor old Bicky was always more or less on the rocks . To the casual and irreflective observer , if you know what I mean , it may sound a pretty good wheeze having a duke for an uncle , but the trouble about old Chiswick was that , though an extremely wealthy old buster , owning half London and about five counties up north , he was notoriously the most prudent spender in England . He was what American chappies would call a hard-boiled egg . If Bicky ’ s people hadn ’ t left him anything and he depended on what he could prise out of the old duke , he was in a pretty bad way . Not that that explained why he was hunting me like this , because he was a chap who never borrowed money . He said he wanted to keep his pals , so never bit any one ’ s ear on principle . At this juncture the door bell rang . Jeeves floated out to answer it . “ Yes , sir . Mr. Wooster has just returned , ” I heard him say . And Bicky came trickling in , looking pretty sorry for himself . “ Halloa , Bicky ! ” I said . “ Jeeves told me you had been trying to get me . Jeeves , bring another glass , and let the revels commence . What ’ s the trouble , Bicky ? ” “ I ’ m in a hole , Bertie . I want your advice. ” “ Say on , old lad ! ” “ My uncle ’ s turning up to-morrow , Bertie. ” “ So Jeeves told me. ” “ The Duke of Chiswick , you know. ” “ So Jeeves told me. ” Bicky seemed a bit surprised . “ Jeeves seems to know everything. ” “ Rather rummily , that ’ s exactly what I was thinking just now myself. ” “ Well , I wish , ” said Bicky gloomily , “ that he knew a way to get me out of the hole I ’ m in. ” Jeeves shimmered in with the glass , and stuck it competently on the table . “ Mr . Bickersteth is in a bit of a hole , Jeeves , ” I said , “ and wants you to rally round. ” “ Very good , sir. ” Bicky looked a bit doubtful . “ Well , of course , you know , Bertie , this thing is by way of being a bit private and all that. ” “ I shouldn ’ t worry about that , old top . I bet Jeeves knows all about it already . Don ’ t you , Jeeves ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Eh ! ” said Bicky , rattled . “ I am open to correction , sir , but is not your dilemma due to the fact that you are at a loss to explain to his grace why you are in New York instead of in Colorado ? ” Bicky rocked like a jelly in a high wind . “ How the deuce do you know anything about it ? ” “ I chanced to meet his grace ’ s butler before we left England . He informed me that he happened to overhear his grace speaking to you on the matter , sir , as he passed the library door. ” Bicky gave a hollow sort of laugh . “ Well , as everybody seems to know all about it , there ’ s no need to try to keep it dark . The old boy turfed me out , Bertie , because he said I was a brainless nincompoop . The idea was that he would give me a remittance on condition that I dashed out to some blighted locality of the name of Colorado and learned farming or ranching , or whatever they call it , at some bally ranch or farm or whatever it ’ s called . I didn ’ t fancy the idea a bit . I should have had to ride horses and pursue cows , and so forth . I hate horses . They bite at you . I was all against the scheme . At the same time , don ’ t you know , I had to have that remittance. ” “ I get you absolutely , dear boy. ” “ Well , when I got to New York it looked a decent sort of place to me , so I thought it would be a pretty sound notion to stop here . So I cabled to my uncle telling him that I had dropped into a good business wheeze in the city and wanted to chuck the ranch idea . He wrote back that it was all right , and here I ’ ve been ever since . He thinks I ’ m doing well at something or other over here . I never dreamed , don ’ t you know , that he would ever come out here . What on earth am I to do ? ” “ Jeeves , ” I said , “ what on earth is Mr. Bickersteth to do ? ” “ You see , ” said Bicky , “ I had a wireless from him to say that he was coming to stay with me—to save hotel bills , I suppose . I ’ ve always given him the impression that I was living in pretty good style . I can ’ t have him to stay at my boarding-house. ” “ Thought of anything , Jeeves ? ” I said . “ To what extent , sir , if the question is not a delicate one , are you prepared to assist Mr. Bickersteth ? ” “ I ’ ll do anything I can for you , of course , Bicky , old man. ” “ Then , if I might make the suggestion , sir , you might lend Mr. Bickersteth—— ” “ No , by Jove ! ” said Bicky firmly . “ I never have touched you , Bertie , and I ’ m not going to start now . I may be a chump , but it ’ s my boast that I don ’ t owe a penny to a single soul—not counting tradesmen , of course. ” “ I was about to suggest , sir , that you might lend Mr. Bickersteth this flat . Mr. Bickersteth could give his grace the impression that he was the owner of it . With your permission I could convey the notion that I was in Mr. Bickersteth ’ s employment , and not in yours . You would be residing here temporarily as Mr. Bickersteth ’ s guest . His grace would occupy the second spare bedroom . I fancy that you would find this answer satisfactorily , sir. ” Bicky had stopped rocking himself and was staring at Jeeves in an awed sort of way . “ I would advocate the dispatching of a wireless message to his grace on board the vessel , notifying him of the change of address . Mr. Bickersteth could meet his grace at the dock and proceed directly here . Will that meet the situation , sir ? ” “ Absolutely. ” “ Thank you , sir. ” Bicky followed him with his eye till the door closed . “ How does he do it , Bertie ? ” he said . “ I ’ ll tell you what I think it is . I believe it ’ s something to do with the shape of his head . Have you ever noticed his head , Bertie , old man ? It sort of sticks out at the back ! ” I hopped out of bed early next morning , so as to be among those present when the old boy should arrive . I knew from experience that these ocean liners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly ungodly hour . It wasn ’ t much after nine by the time I ’ d dressed and had my morning tea and was leaning out of the window , watching the street for Bicky and his uncle . It was one of those jolly , peaceful mornings that make a chappie wish he ’ d got a soul or something , and I was just brooding on life in general when I became aware of the dickens of a spate in progress down below . A taxi had driven up , and an old boy in a top hat had got out and was kicking up a frightful row about the fare . As far as I could make out , he was trying to get the cab chappie to switch from New York to London prices , and the cab chappie had apparently never heard of London before , and didn ’ t seem to think a lot of it now . The old boy said that in London the trip would have set him back eightpence ; and the cabby said he should worry . I called to Jeeves . “ The duke has arrived , Jeeves. ” “ Yes , sir ? ” “ That ’ ll be him at the door now. ” Jeeves made a long arm and opened the front door , and the old boy crawled in , looking licked to a splinter . “ How do you do , sir ? ” I said , bustling up and being the ray of sunshine . “ Your nephew went down to the dock to meet you , but you must have missed him . My name ’ s Wooster , don ’ t you know . Great pal of Bicky ’ s , and all that sort of thing . I ’ m staying with him , you know . Would you like a cup of tea ? Jeeves , bring a cup of tea. ” Old Chiswick had sunk into an arm-chair and was looking about the room . “ Does this luxurious flat belong to my nephew Francis ? ” “ Absolutely. ” “ It must be terribly expensive. ” “ Pretty well , of course . Everything costs a lot over here , you know. ” He moaned . Jeeves filtered in with the tea . Old Chiswick took a stab at it to restore his tissues , and nodded . “ A terrible country , Mr. Wooster ! A terrible country ! Nearly eight shillings for a short cab-drive ! Iniquitous ! ” He took another look round the room . It seemed to fascinate him . “ Have you any idea how much my nephew pays for this flat , Mr. Wooster ? ” “ About two hundred dollars a month , I believe. ” “ What ! Forty pounds a month ! ” I began to see that , unless I made the thing a bit more plausible , the scheme might turn out a frost . I could guess what the old boy was thinking . He was trying to square all this prosperity with what he knew of poor old Bicky . And one had to admit that it took a lot of squaring , for dear old Bicky , though a stout fellow and absolutely unrivalled as an imitator of bull-terriers and cats , was in many ways one of the most pronounced fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gent ’ s underwear . “ I suppose it seems rummy to you , ” I said , “ but the fact is New York often bucks chappies up and makes them show a flash of speed that you wouldn ’ t have imagined them capable of . It sort of develops them . Something in the air , don ’ t you know . I imagine that Bicky in the past , when you knew him , may have been something of a chump , but it ’ s quite different now . Devilish efficient sort of chappie , and looked on in commercial circles as quite the nib ! ” “ I am amazed ! What is the nature of my nephew ’ s business , Mr. Wooster ? ” “ Oh , just business , don ’ t you know . The same sort of thing Carnegie and Rockefeller and all these coves do , you know. ” I slid for the door . “ Awfully sorry to leave you , but I ’ ve got to meet some of the lads elsewhere. ” Coming out of the lift I met Bicky bustling in from the street . “ Halloa , Bertie ! I missed him . Has he turned up ? ” “ He ’ s upstairs now , having some tea. ” “ What does he think of it all ? ” “ He ’ s absolutely rattled. ” “ Ripping ! I ’ ll be toddling up , then . Toodle-oo , Bertie , old man . See you later. ” “ Pip-pip , Bicky , dear boy. ” He trotted off , full of merriment and good cheer , and I went off to the club to sit in the window and watch the traffic coming up one way and going down the other . It was latish in the evening when I looked in at the flat to dress for dinner . “ Where ’ s everybody , Jeeves ? ” I said , finding no little feet pattering about the place . “ Gone out ? ” “ His grace desired to see some of the sights of the city , sir . Mr. Bickersteth is acting as his escort . I fancy their immediate objective was Grant ’ s Tomb. ” “ I suppose Mr. Bickersteth is a bit braced at the way things are going—what ? ” “ Sir ? ” “ I say , I take it that Mr. Bickersteth is tolerably full of beans. ” “ Not altogether , sir. ” “ What ’ s his trouble now ? ” “ The scheme which I took the liberty of suggesting to Mr. Bickersteth and yourself has , unfortunately , not answered entirely satisfactorily , sir. ” “ Surely the duke believes that Mr. Bickersteth is doing well in business , and all that sort of thing ? ” “ Exactly , sir . With the result that he has decided to cancel Mr. Bickersteth ’ s monthly allowance , on the ground that , as Mr. Bickersteth is doing so well on his own account , he no longer requires pecuniary assistance. ” “ Great Scot , Jeeves ! This is awful. ” “ Somewhat disturbing , sir. ” “ I never expected anything like this ! ” “ I confess I scarcely anticipated the contingency myself , sir. ” “ I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely ? ” “ Mr . Bickersteth appeared somewhat taken aback , sir. ” My heart bled for Bicky . “ We must do something , Jeeves. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Can you think of anything ? ” “ Not at the moment , sir. ” “ There must be something we can do. ” “ It was a maxim of one of my former employers , sir—as I believe I mentioned to you once before—the present Lord Bridgnorth , that there is always a way . I remember his lordship using the expression on the occasion—he was then a business gentleman and had not yet received his title—when a patent hair-restorer which he chanced to be promoting failed to attract the public . He put it on the market under another name as a depilatory , and amassed a substantial fortune . I have generally found his lordship ’ s aphorism based on sound foundations . No doubt we shall be able to discover some solution of Mr. Bickersteth ’ s difficulty , sir. ” “ Well , have a stab at it , Jeeves ! ” “ I will spare no pains , sir. ” I went and dressed sadly . It will show you pretty well how pipped I was when I tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinner-jacket . I sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because I wanted it . It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed for the breadline . When I got back old Chiswick had gone to bed , but Bicky was there , hunched up in an arm-chair , brooding pretty tensely , with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth and a more or less glassy stare in his eyes . He had the aspect of one who had been soaked with what the newspaper chappies call “ some blunt instrument. ” “ This is a bit thick , old thing—what ! ” I said . He picked up his glass and drained it feverishly , overlooking the fact that it hadn ’ t anything in it . “ I ’ m done , Bertie ! ” he said . He had another go at the glass . It didn ’ t seem to do him any good . “ If only this had happened a week later , Bertie ! My next month ’ s money was due to roll in on Saturday . I could have worked a wheeze I ’ ve been reading about in the magazine advertisements . It seems that you can make a dashed amount of money if you can only collect a few dollars and start a chicken-farm . Jolly sound scheme , Bertie ! Say you buy a hen—call it one hen for the sake of argument . It lays an egg every day of the week . You sell the eggs seven for twenty-five cents . Keep of hen costs nothing . Profit practically twenty-five cents on every seven eggs . Or look at it another way : Suppose you have a dozen hens . Each of the hens has a dozen chickens . The chickens grow up and have more chickens . Why , in no time you ’ d have the place covered knee-deep in hens , all laying eggs , at twenty-five cents for every seven . You ’ d make a fortune . Jolly life , too , keeping hens ! ” He had begun to get quite worked up at the thought of it , but he slopped back in his chair at this juncture with a good deal of gloom . “ But , of course , it ’ s no good , ” he said , “ because I haven ’ t the cash. ” “ You ’ ve only to say the word , you know , Bicky , old top. ” “ Thanks awfully , Bertie , but I ’ m not going to sponge on you. ” That ’ s always the way in this world . The chappies you ’ d like to lend money to won ’ t let you , whereas the chappies you don ’ t want to lend it to will do everything except actually stand you on your head and lift the specie out of your pockets . As a lad who has always rolled tolerably free in the right stuff , I ’ ve had lots of experience of the second class . Many ’ s the time , back in London , I ’ ve hurried along Piccadilly and felt the hot breath of the toucher on the back of my neck and heard his sharp , excited yapping as he closed in on me . I ’ ve simply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters I didn ’ t care a hang for ; yet here was I now , dripping doubloons and pieces of eight and longing to hand them over , and Bicky , poor fish , absolutely on his uppers , not taking any at any price . “ Well , there ’ s only one hope , then. ” “ What ’ s that ? ” “ Jeeves. ” “ Sir ? ” There was Jeeves , standing behind me , full of zeal . In this matter of shimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree . You ’ re sitting in the old arm-chair , thinking of this and that , and then suddenly you look up , and there he is . He moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly fish . The thing startled poor old Bicky considerably . He rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant . I ’ m used to Jeeves now , but often in the days when he first came to me I ’ ve bitten my tongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst . “ Did you call , sir ? ” “ Oh , there you are , Jeeves ! ” “ Precisely , sir. ” “ Jeeves , Mr. Bickersteth is still up the pole . Any ideas ? ” “ Why , yes , sir . Since we had our recent conversation I fancy I have found what may prove a solution . I do not wish to appear to be taking a liberty , sir , but I think that we have overlooked his grace ’ s potentialities as a source of revenue. ” Bicky laughed , what I have sometimes seen described as a hollow , mocking laugh , a sort of bitter cackle from the back of the throat , rather like a gargle . “ I do not allude , sir , ” explained Jeeves , “ to the possibility of inducing his grace to part with money . I am taking the liberty of regarding his grace in the light of an at present—if I may say so—useless property , which is capable of being developed. ” Bicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way . I ’ m bound to say I didn ’ t get it myself . “ Couldn ’ t you make it a bit easier , Jeeves ! ” “ In a nutshell , sir , what I mean is this : His grace is , in a sense , a prominent personage . The inhabitants of this country , as no doubt you are aware , sir , are peculiarly addicted to shaking hands with prominent personages . It occurred to me that Mr. Bickersteth or yourself might know of persons who would be willing to pay a small fee—let us say two dollars or three—for the privilege of an introduction , including handshake , to his grace. ” Bicky didn ’ t seem to think much of it . “ Do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid cash just to shake hands with my uncle ? ” “ I have an aunt , sir , who paid five shillings to a young fellow for bringing a moving-picture actor to tea at her house one Sunday . It gave her social standing among the neighbours. ” Bicky wavered . “ If you think it could be done—— ” “ I feel convinced of it , sir. ” “ What do you think , Bertie ? ” “ I ’ m for it , old boy , absolutely . A very brainy wheeze. ” “ Thank you , sir . Will there be anything further ? Good night , sir. ” And he floated out , leaving us to discuss details . Until we started this business of floating old Chiswick as a money-making proposition I had never realized what a perfectly foul time those Stock Exchange chappies must have when the public isn ’ t biting freely . Nowadays I read that bit they put in the financial reports about “ The market opened quietly ” with a sympathetic eye , for , by Jove , it certainly opened quietly for us ! You ’ d hardly believe how difficult it was to interest the public and make them take a flutter on the old boy . By the end of the week the only name we had on our list was a delicatessen-store keeper down in Bicky ’ s part of the town , and as he wanted us to take it out in sliced ham instead of cash that didn ’ t help much . There was a gleam of light when the brother of Bicky ’ s pawnbroker offered ten dollars , money down , for an introduction to old Chiswick , but the deal fell through , owing to its turning out that the chap was an anarchist and intended to kick the old boy instead of shaking hands with him . At that , it took me the deuce of a time to persuade Bicky not to grab the cash and let things take their course . He seemed to regard the pawnbroker ’ s brother rather as a sportsman and benefactor of his species than otherwise . The whole thing , I ’ m inclined to think , would have been off if it hadn ’ t been for Jeeves . There is no doubt that Jeeves is in a class of his own . In the matter of brain and resource I don ’ t think I have ever met a chappie so supremely like mother made . He trickled into my room one morning with a good old cup of tea , and intimated that there was something doing . “ Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace , sir ? ” “ It ’ s all off . We ’ ve decided to chuck it. ” “ Sir ? ” “ It won ’ t work . We can ’ t get anybody to come. ” “ I fancy I can arrange that aspect of the matter , sir. ” “ Do you mean to say you ’ ve managed to get anybody ? ” “ Yes , sir . Eighty-seven gentlemen from Birdsburg , sir. ” I sat up in bed and spilt the tea . “ Birdsburg ? ” “ Birdsburg , Missouri , sir. ” “ How did you get them ? ” “ I happened last night , sir , as you had intimated that you would be absent from home , to attend a theatrical performance , and entered into conversation between the acts with the occupant of the adjoining seat . I had observed that he was wearing a somewhat ornate decoration in his buttonhole , sir—a large blue button with the words ‘ Boost for Birdsburg ’ upon it in red letters , scarcely a judicious addition to a gentleman ’ s evening costume . To my surprise I noticed that the auditorium was full of persons similarly decorated . I ventured to inquire the explanation , and was informed that these gentlemen , forming a party of eighty-seven , are a convention from a town of the name if Birdsburg , in the State of Missouri . Their visit , I gathered , was purely of a social and pleasurable nature , and my informant spoke at some length of the entertainments arranged for their stay in the city . It was when he related with a considerable amount of satisfaction and pride , that a deputation of their number had been introduced to and had shaken hands with a well-known prizefighter , that it occurred to me to broach the subject of his grace . To make a long story short , sir , I have arranged , subject to your approval , that the entire convention shall be presented to his grace to-morrow afternoon. ” I was amazed . This chappie was a Napoleon . “ Eighty-seven , Jeeves . At how much a head ? ” “ I was obliged to agree to a reduction for quantity , sir . The terms finally arrived at were one hundred and fifty dollars for the party. ” I thought a bit . “ Payable in advance ? ” “ No , sir . I endeavoured to obtain payment in advance , but was not successful. ” “ Well , any way , when we get it I ’ ll make it up to five hundred . Bicky ’ ll never know . Do you suspect Mr. Bickersteth would suspect anything , Jeeves , if I made it up to five hundred ? ” “ I fancy not , sir . Mr. Bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman , but not bright. ” “ All right , then . After breakfast run down to the bank and get me some money. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ You know , you ’ re a bit of a marvel , Jeeves. ” “ Thank you , sir. ” “ Right-o ! ” “ Very good , sir. ” When I took dear old Bicky aside in the course of the morning and told him what had happened he nearly broke down . He tottered into the sitting-room and buttonholed old Chiswick , who was reading the comic section of the morning paper with a kind of grim resolution . “ Uncle , ” he said , “ are you doing anything special to-morrow afternoon ? I mean to say , I ’ ve asked a few of my pals in to meet you , don ’ t you know. ” The old boy cocked a speculative eye at him . “ There will be no reporters among them ? ” “ Reporters ? Rather not ! Why ? ” “ I refuse to be badgered by reporters . There were a number of adhesive young men who endeavoured to elicit from me my views on America while the boat was approaching the dock . I will not be subjected to this persecution again. ” “ That ’ ll be absolutely all right , uncle . There won ’ t be a newspaper-man in the place. ” “ In that case I shall be glad to make the acquaintance of your friends. ” “ You ’ ll shake hands with them and so forth ? ” “ I shall naturally order my behaviour according to the accepted rules of civilized intercourse. ” Bicky thanked him heartily and came off to lunch with me at the club , where he babbled freely of hens , incubators , and other rotten things . After mature consideration we had decided to unleash the Birdsburg contingent on the old boy ten at a time . Jeeves brought his theatre pal round to see us , and we arranged the whole thing with him . A very decent chappie , but rather inclined to collar the conversation and turn it in the direction of his home-town ’ s new water-supply system . We settled that , as an hour was about all he would be likely to stand , each gang should consider itself entitled to seven minutes of the duke ’ s society by Jeeves ’ s stop-watch , and that when their time was up Jeeves should slide into the room and cough meaningly . Then we parted with what I believe are called mutual expressions of goodwill , the Birdsburg chappie extending a cordial invitation to us all to pop out some day and take a look at the new water-supply system , for which we thanked him . Next day the deputation rolled in . The first shift consisted of the cove we had met and nine others almost exactly like him in every respect . They all looked deuced keen and businesslike , as if from youth up they had been working in the office and catching the boss ’ s eye and what-not . They shook hands with the old boy with a good deal of apparent satisfaction—all except one chappie , who seemed to be brooding about something—and then they stood off and became chatty . “ What message have you for Birdsburg , Duke ? ” asked our pal . The old boy seemed a bit rattled . “ I have never been to Birdsburg. ” The chappie seemed pained . “ You should pay it a visit , ” he said . “ The most rapidly-growing city in the country . Boost for Birdsburg ! ” “ Boost for Birdsburg ! ” said the other chappies reverently . The chappie who had been brooding suddenly gave tongue . “ Say ! ” He was a stout sort of well-fed cove with one of those determined chins and a cold eye . The assemblage looked at him . “ As a matter of business , ” said the chappie— “ mind you , I ’ m not questioning anybody ’ s good faith , but , as a matter of strict business—I think this gentleman here ought to put himself on record before witnesses as stating that he really is a duke. ” “ What do you mean , sir ? ” cried the old boy , getting purple . “ No offence , simply business . I ’ m not saying anything , mind you , but there ’ s one thing that seems kind of funny to me . This gentleman here says his name ’ s Mr. Bickersteth , as I understand it . Well , if you ’ re the Duke of Chiswick , why isn ’ t he Lord Percy Something ? I ’ ve read English novels , and I know all about it. ” “ This is monstrous ! ” “ Now don ’ t get hot under the collar . I ’ m only asking . I ’ ve a right to know . You ’ re going to take our money , so it ’ s only fair that we should see that we get our money ’ s worth. ” The water-supply cove chipped in : “ You ’ re quite right , Simms . I overlooked that when making the agreement . You see , gentlemen , as business men we ’ ve a right to reasonable guarantees of good faith . We are paying Mr. Bickersteth here a hundred and fifty dollars for this reception , and we naturally want to know—— ” Old Chiswick gave Bicky a searching look ; then he turned to the water-supply chappie . He was frightfully calm . “ I can assure you that I know nothing of this , ” he said , quite politely . “ I should be grateful if you would explain. ” “ Well , we arranged with Mr. Bickersteth that eighty-seven citizens of Birdsburg should have the privilege of meeting and shaking hands with you for a financial consideration mutually arranged , and what my friend Simms here means—and I ’ m with him—is that we have only Mr. Bickersteth ’ s word for it—and he is a stranger to us—that you are the Duke of Chiswick at all. ” Old Chiswick gulped . “ Allow me to assure you , sir , ” he said , in a rummy kind of voice , “ that I am the Duke of Chiswick. ” “ Then that ’ s all right , ” said the chappie heartily . “ That was all we wanted to know . Let the thing go on. ” “ I am sorry to say , ” said old Chiswick , “ that it can not go on . I am feeling a little tired . I fear I must ask to be excused. ” “ But there are seventy-seven of the boys waiting round the corner at this moment , Duke , to be introduced to you. ” “ I fear I must disappoint them. ” “ But in that case the deal would have to be off. ” “ That is a matter for you and my nephew to discuss. ” The chappie seemed troubled . “ You really won ’ t meet the rest of them ? ” “ No ! ” “ Well , then , I guess we ’ ll be going. ” They went out , and there was a pretty solid silence . Then old Chiswick turned to Bicky : “ Well ? ” Bicky didn ’ t seem to have anything to say . “ Was it true what that man said ? ” “ Yes , uncle. ” “ What do you mean by playing this trick ? ” Bicky seemed pretty well knocked out , so I put in a word . “ I think you ’ d better explain the whole thing , Bicky , old top. ” Bicky ’ s Adam ’ s-apple jumped about a bit ; then he started : “ You see , you had cut off my allowance , uncle , and I wanted a bit of money to start a chicken farm . I mean to say it ’ s an absolute cert if you once get a bit of capital . You buy a hen , and it lays an egg every day of the week , and you sell the eggs , say , seven for twenty-five cents . “ Keep of hens cost nothing . Profit practically—— ” “ What is all this nonsense about hens ? You led me to suppose you were a substantial business man. ” “ Old Bicky rather exaggerated , sir , ” I said , helping the chappie out . “ The fact is , the poor old lad is absolutely dependent on that remittance of yours , and when you cut it off , don ’ t you know , he was pretty solidly in the soup , and had to think of some way of closing in on a bit of the ready pretty quick . That ’ s why we thought of this handshaking scheme. ” Old Chiswick foamed at the mouth . “ So you have lied to me ! You have deliberately deceived me as to your financial status ! ” “ Poor old Bicky didn ’ t want to go to that ranch , ” I explained . “ He doesn ’ t like cows and horses , but he rather thinks he would be hot stuff among the hens . All he wants is a bit of capital . Don ’ t you think it would be rather a wheeze if you were to—— ” “ After what has happened ? After this—this deceit and foolery ? Not a penny ! ” “ But—— ” “ Not a penny ! ” There was a respectful cough in the background . “ If I might make a suggestion , sir ? ” Jeeves was standing on the horizon , looking devilish brainy . “ Go ahead , Jeeves ! ” I said . “ I would merely suggest , sir , that if Mr. Bickersteth is in need of a little ready money , and is at a loss to obtain it elsewhere , he might secure the sum he requires by describing the occurrences of this afternoon for the Sunday issue of one of the more spirited and enterprising newspapers. ” “ By Jove ! ” I said . “ By George ! ” said Bicky . “ Great heavens ! ” said old Chiswick . “ Very good , sir , ” said Jeeves . Bicky turned to old Chiswick with a gleaming eye . “ Jeeves is right . I ’ ll do it ! The _Chronicle_ would jump at it . They eat that sort of stuff. ” Old Chiswick gave a kind of moaning howl . “ I absolutely forbid you , Francis , to do this thing ! ” “ That ’ s all very well , ” said Bicky , wonderfully braced , “ but if I can ’ t get the money any other way—— ” “ Wait ! Er—wait , my boy ! You are so impetuous ! We might arrange something. ” “ I won ’ t go to that bally ranch. ” “ No , no ! No , no , my boy ! I would not suggest it . I would not for a moment suggest it . I—I think—— ” He seemed to have a bit of a struggle with himself . “ I—I think that , on the whole , it would be best if you returned with me to England . I—I might—in fact , I think I see my way to doing—to—I might be able to utilize your services in some secretarial position. ” “ I shouldn ’ t mind that. ” “ I should not be able to offer you a salary , but , as you know , in English political life the unpaid secretary is a recognized figure—— ” “ The only figure I ’ ll recognize , ” said Bicky firmly , “ is five hundred quid a year , paid quarterly. ” “ My dear boy ! ” “ Absolutely ! ” “ But your recompense , my dear Francis , would consist in the unrivalled opportunities you would have , as my secretary , to gain experience , to accustom yourself to the intricacies of political life , to—in fact , you would be in an exceedingly advantageous position. ” “ Five hundred a year ! ” said Bicky , rolling it round his tongue . “ Why , that would be nothing to what I could make if I started a chicken farm . It stands to reason . Suppose you have a dozen hens . Each of the hens has a dozen chickens . After a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozen chickens each themselves , and then they all start laying eggs ! There ’ s a fortune in it . You can get anything you like for eggs in America . Chappies keep them on ice for years and years , and don ’ t sell them till they fetch about a dollar a whirl . You don ’ t think I ’ m going to chuck a future like this for anything under five hundred o ’ goblins a year—what ? ” A look of anguish passed over old Chiswick ’ s face , then he seemed to be resigned to it . “ Very well , my boy , ” he said . “ What-o ! ” said Bicky . “ All right , then. ” “ Jeeves , ” I said . Bicky had taken the old boy off to dinner to celebrate , and we were alone . “ Jeeves , this has been one of your best efforts. ” “ Thank you , sir. ” “ It beats me how you do it. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ The only trouble is you haven ’ t got much out of it—what ! ” “ I fancy Mr. Bickersteth intends—I judge from his remarks—to signify his appreciation of anything I have been fortunate enough to do to assist him , at some later date when he is in a more favourable position to do so. ” “ It isn ’ t enough , Jeeves ! ” “ Sir ? ” It was a wrench , but I felt it was the only possible thing to be done . “ Bring my shaving things. ” A gleam of hope shone in the chappie ’ s eye , mixed with doubt . “ You mean , sir ? ” “ And shave off my moustache. ” There was a moment ’ s silence . I could see the fellow was deeply moved . “ Thank you very much indeed , sir , ” he said , in a low voice , and popped off . ABSENT TREATMENT I want to tell you all about dear old Bobbie Cardew . It ’ s a most interesting story . I can ’ t put in any literary style and all that ; but I don ’ t have to , don ’ t you know , because it goes on its Moral Lesson . If you ’ re a man you mustn ’ t miss it , because it ’ ll be a warning to you ; and if you ’ re a woman you won ’ t want to , because it ’ s all about how a girl made a man feel pretty well fed up with things . If you ’ re a recent acquaintance of Bobbie ’ s , you ’ ll probably be surprised to hear that there was a time when he was more remarkable for the weakness of his memory than anything else . Dozens of fellows , who have only met Bobbie since the change took place , have been surprised when I told them that . Yet it ’ s true . Believe _me_ . In the days when I first knew him Bobbie Cardew was about the most pronounced young rotter inside the four-mile radius . People have called me a silly ass , but I was never in the same class with Bobbie . When it came to being a silly ass , he was a plus-four man , while my handicap was about six . Why , if I wanted him to dine with me , I used to post him a letter at the beginning of the week , and then the day before send him a telegram and a phone-call on the day itself , and—half an hour before the time we ’ d fixed—a messenger in a taxi , whose business it was to see that he got in and that the chauffeur had the address all correct . By doing this I generally managed to get him , unless he had left town before my messenger arrived . The funny thing was that he wasn ’ t altogether a fool in other ways . Deep down in him there was a kind of stratum of sense . I had known him , once or twice , show an almost human intelligence . But to reach that stratum , mind you , you needed dynamite . At least , that ’ s what I thought . But there was another way which hadn ’ t occurred to me . Marriage , I mean . Marriage , the dynamite of the soul ; that was what hit Bobbie . He married . Have you ever seen a bull-pup chasing a bee ? The pup sees the bee . It looks good to him . But he still doesn ’ t know what ’ s at the end of it till he gets there . It was like that with Bobbie . He fell in love , got married—with a sort of whoop , as if it were the greatest fun in the world—and then began to find out things . She wasn ’ t the sort of girl you would have expected Bobbie to rave about . And yet , I don ’ t know . What I mean is , she worked for her living ; and to a fellow who has never done a hand ’ s turn in his life there ’ s undoubtedly a sort of fascination , a kind of romance , about a girl who works for her living . Her name was Anthony . Mary Anthony . She was about five feet six ; she had a ton and a half of red-gold hair , grey eyes , and one of those determined chins . She was a hospital nurse . When Bobbie smashed himself up at polo , she was told off by the authorities to smooth his brow and rally round with cooling unguents and all that ; and the old boy hadn ’ t been up and about again for more than a week before they popped off to the registrar ’ s and fixed it up . Quite the romance . Bobbie broke the news to me at the club one evening , and next day he introduced me to her . I admired her . I ’ ve never worked myself—my name ’ s Pepper , by the way . Almost forgot to mention it . Reggie Pepper . My uncle Edward was Pepper , Wells , and Co. , the Colliery people . He left me a sizable chunk of bullion—I say I ’ ve never worked myself , but I admire any one who earns a living under difficulties , especially a girl . And this girl had had a rather unusually tough time of it , being an orphan and all that , and having had to do everything off her own bat for years . Mary and I got along together splendidly . We don ’ t now , but we ’ ll come to that later . I ’ m speaking of the past . She seemed to think Bobbie the greatest thing on earth , judging by the way she looked at him when she thought I wasn ’ t noticing . And Bobbie seemed to think the same about her . So that I came to the conclusion that , if only dear old Bobbie didn ’ t forget to go to the wedding , they had a sporting chance of being quite happy . Well , let ’ s brisk up a bit here , and jump a year . The story doesn ’ t really start till then . They took a flat and settled down . I was in and out of the place quite a good deal . I kept my eyes open , and everything seemed to me to be running along as smoothly as you could want . If this was marriage , I thought , I couldn ’ t see why fellows were so frightened of it . There were a lot of worse things that could happen to a man . But we now come to the incident of the quiet Dinner , and it ’ s just here that love ’ s young dream hits a snag , and things begin to occur . I happened to meet Bobbie in Piccadilly , and he asked me to come back to dinner at the flat . And , like a fool , instead of bolting and putting myself under police protection , I went . When we got to the flat , there was Mrs. Bobbie looking—well , I tell you , it staggered me . Her gold hair was all piled up in waves and crinkles and things , with a what-d ’ -you-call-it of diamonds in it . And she was wearing the most perfectly ripping dress . I couldn ’ t begin to describe it . I can only say it was the limit . It struck me that if this was how she was in the habit of looking every night when they were dining quietly at home together , it was no wonder that Bobbie liked domesticity . “ Here ’ s old Reggie , dear , ” said Bobbie . “ I ’ ve brought him home to have a bit of dinner . I ’ ll phone down to the kitchen and ask them to send it up now—what ? ” She stared at him as if she had never seen him before . Then she turned scarlet . Then she turned as white as a sheet . Then she gave a little laugh . It was most interesting to watch . Made me wish I was up a tree about eight hundred miles away . Then she recovered herself . “ I am so glad you were able to come , Mr. Pepper , ” she said , smiling at me . And after that she was all right . At least , you would have said so . She talked a lot at dinner , and chaffed Bobbie , and played us ragtime on the piano afterwards , as if she hadn ’ t a care in the world . Quite a jolly little party it was—not . I ’ m no lynx-eyed sleuth , and all that sort of thing , but I had seen her face at the beginning , and I knew that she was working the whole time and working hard , to keep herself in hand , and that she would have given that diamond what ’ s-its-name in her hair and everything else she possessed to have one good scream—just one . I ’ ve sat through some pretty thick evenings in my time , but that one had the rest beaten in a canter . At the very earliest moment I grabbed my hat and got away . Having seen what I did , I wasn ’ t particularly surprised to meet Bobbie at the club next day looking about as merry and bright as a lonely gum-drop at an Eskimo tea-party . He started in straightway . He seemed glad to have someone to talk to about it . “ Do you know how long I ’ ve been married ? ” he said . I didn ’ t exactly . “ About a year , isn ’ t it ? ” “ Not _about_ a year , ” he said sadly . “ Exactly a year—yesterday ! ” Then I understood . I saw light—a regular flash of light . “ Yesterday was—— ? ” “ The anniversary of the wedding . I ’ d arranged to take Mary to the Savoy , and on to Covent Garden . She particularly wanted to hear Caruso . I had the ticket for the box in my pocket . Do you know , all through dinner I had a kind of rummy idea that there was something I ’ d forgotten , but I couldn ’ t think what ? ” “ Till your wife mentioned it ? ” He nodded—— “ She—mentioned it , ” he said thoughtfully . I didn ’ t ask for details . Women with hair and chins like Mary ’ s may be angels most of the time , but , when they take off their wings for a bit , they aren ’ t half-hearted about it . “ To be absolutely frank , old top , ” said poor old Bobbie , in a broken sort of way , “ my stock ’ s pretty low at home. ” There didn ’ t seem much to be done . I just lit a cigarette and sat there . He didn ’ t want to talk . Presently he went out . I stood at the window of our upper smoking-room , which looks out on to Piccadilly , and watched him . He walked slowly along for a few yards , stopped , then walked on again , and finally turned into a jeweller ’ s . Which was an instance of what I meant when I said that deep down in him there was a certain stratum of sense . It was from now on that I began to be really interested in this problem of Bobbie ’ s married life . Of course , one ’ s always mildly interested in one ’ s friends ’ marriages , hoping they ’ ll turn out well and all that ; but this was different . The average man isn ’ t like Bobbie , and the average girl isn ’ t like Mary . It was that old business of the immovable mass and the irresistible force . There was Bobbie , ambling gently through life , a dear old chap in a hundred ways , but undoubtedly a chump of the first water . And there was Mary , determined that he shouldn ’ t be a chump . And Nature , mind you , on Bobbie ’ s side . When Nature makes a chump like dear old Bobbie , she ’ s proud of him , and doesn ’ t want her handiwork disturbed . She gives him a sort of natural armour to protect him against outside interference . And that armour is shortness of memory . Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump , when , but for it , he might cease to be one . Take my case , for instance . I ’ m a chump . Well , if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life , my size in hats would be about number nine . But I didn ’ t . I forgot them . And it was just the same with Bobbie . For about a week , perhaps a bit more , the recollection of that quiet little domestic evening bucked him up like a tonic . Elephants , I read somewhere , are champions at the memory business , but they were fools to Bobbie during that week . But , bless you , the shock wasn ’ t nearly big enough . It had dinted the armour , but it hadn ’ t made a hole in it . Pretty soon he was back at the old game . It was pathetic , don ’ t you know . The poor girl loved him , and she was frightened . It was the thin edge of the wedge , you see , and she knew it . A man who forgets what day he was married , when he ’ s been married one year , will forget , at about the end of the fourth , that he ’ s married at all . If she meant to get him in hand at all , she had got to do it now , before he began to drift away . I saw that clearly enough , and I tried to make Bobbie see it , when he was by way of pouring out his troubles to me one afternoon . I can ’ t remember what it was that he had forgotten the day before , but it was something she had asked him to bring home for her—it may have been a book . “ It ’ s such a little thing to make a fuss about , ” said Bobbie . “ And she knows that it ’ s simply because I ’ ve got such an infernal memory about everything . I can ’ t remember anything . Never could. ” He talked on for a while , and , just as he was going , he pulled out a couple of sovereigns . “ Oh , by the way , ” he said . “ What ’ s this for ? ” I asked , though I knew . “ I owe it you. ” “ How ’ s that ? ” I said . “ Why , that bet on Tuesday . In the billiard-room . Murray and Brown were playing a hundred up , and I gave you two to one that Brown would win , and Murray beat him by twenty odd. ” “ So you do remember some things ? ” I said . He got quite excited . Said that if I thought he was the sort of rotter who forgot to pay when he lost a bet , it was pretty rotten of me after knowing him all these years , and a lot more like that . “ Subside , laddie , ” I said . Then I spoke to him like a father . “ What you ’ ve got to do , my old college chum , ” I said , “ is to pull yourself together , and jolly quick , too . As things are shaping , you ’ re due for a nasty knock before you know what ’ s hit you . You ’ ve got to make an effort . Don ’ t say you can ’ t . This two quid business shows that , even if your memory is rocky , you can remember some things . What you ’ ve got to do is to see that wedding anniversaries and so on are included in the list . It may be a brainstrain , but you can ’ t get out of it. ” “ I suppose you ’ re right , ” said Bobbie . “ But it beats me why she thinks such a lot of these rotten little dates . What ’ s it matter if I forgot what day we were married on or what day she was born on or what day the cat had the measles ? She knows I love her just as much as if I were a memorizing freak at the halls. ” “ That ’ s not enough for a woman , ” I said . “ They want to be shown . Bear that in mind , and you ’ re all right . Forget it , and there ’ ll be trouble. ” He chewed the knob of his stick . “ Women are frightfully rummy , ” he said gloomily . “ You should have thought of that before you married one , ” I said . I don ’ t see that I could have done any more . I had put the whole thing in a nutshell for him . You would have thought he ’ d have seen the point , and that it would have made him brace up and get a hold on himself . But no . Off he went again in the same old way . I gave up arguing with him . I had a good deal of time on my hands , but not enough to amount to anything when it was a question of reforming dear old Bobbie by argument . If you see a man asking for trouble , and insisting on getting it , the only thing to do is to stand by and wait till it comes to him . After that you may get a chance . But till then there ’ s nothing to be done . But I thought a lot about him . Bobbie didn ’ t get into the soup all at once . Weeks went by , and months , and still nothing happened . Now and then he ’ d come into the club with a kind of cloud on his shining morning face , and I ’ d know that there had been doings in the home ; but it wasn ’ t till well on in the spring that he got the thunderbolt just where he had been asking for it—in the thorax . I was smoking a quiet cigarette one morning in the window looking out over Piccadilly , and watching the buses and motors going up one way and down the other—most interesting it is ; I often do it—when in rushed Bobbie , with his eyes bulging and his face the colour of an oyster , waving a piece of paper in his hand . “ Reggie , ” he said . “ Reggie , old top , she ’ s gone ! ” “ Gone ! ” I said . “ Who ? ” “ Mary , of course ! Gone ! Left me ! Gone ! ” “ Where ? ” I said . Silly question ? Perhaps you ’ re right . Anyhow , dear old Bobbie nearly foamed at the mouth . “ Where ? How should I know where ? Here , read this. ” He pushed the paper into my hand . It was a letter . “ Go on , ” said Bobbie . “ Read it. ” So I did . It certainly was quite a letter . There was not much of it , but it was all to the point . This is what it said : “ MY DEAR BOBBIE , —I am going away . When you care enough about me to remember to wish me many happy returns on my birthday , I will come back . My address will be Box 341 , _London Morning News_. ” I read it twice , then I said , “ Well , why don ’ t you ? ” “ Why don ’ t I what ? ” “ Why don ’ t you wish her many happy returns ? It doesn ’ t seem much to ask. ” “ But she says on her birthday. ” “ Well , when is her birthday ? ” “ Can ’ t you understand ? ” said Bobbie . “ I ’ ve forgotten. ” “ Forgotten ! ” I said . “ Yes , ” said Bobbie . “ Forgotten. ” “ How do you mean , forgotten ? ” I said . “ Forgotten whether it ’ s the twentieth or the twenty-first , or what ? How near do you get to it ? ” “ I know it came somewhere between the first of January and the thirty-first of December . That ’ s how near I get to it. ” “ Think. ” “ Think ? What ’ s the use of saying ‘ Think ’ ? Think I haven ’ t thought ? I ’ ve been knocking sparks out of my brain ever since I opened that letter. ” “ And you can ’ t remember ? ” “ No. ” I rang the bell and ordered restoratives . “ Well , Bobbie , ” I said , “ it ’ s a pretty hard case to spring on an untrained amateur like me . Suppose someone had come to Sherlock Holmes and said , ‘ Mr . Holmes , here ’ s a case for you . When is my wife ’ s birthday ? ’ Wouldn ’ t that have given Sherlock a jolt ? However , I know enough about the game to understand that a fellow can ’ t shoot off his deductive theories unless you start him with a clue , so rouse yourself out of that pop-eyed trance and come across with two or three . For instance , can ’ t you remember the last time she had a birthday ? What sort of weather was it ? That might fix the month. ” Bobbie shook his head . “ It was just ordinary weather , as near as I can recollect. ” “ Warm ? ” “ Warmish. ” “ Or cold ? ” “ Well , fairly cold , perhaps . I can ’ t remember. ” I ordered two more of the same . They seemed indicated in the Young Detective ’ s Manual . “ You ’ re a great help , Bobbie , ” I said . “ An invaluable assistant . One of those indispensable adjuncts without which no home is complete. ” Bobbie seemed to be thinking . “ I ’ ve got it , ” he said suddenly . “ Look here . I gave her a present on her last birthday . All we have to do is to go to the shop , hunt up the date when it was bought , and the thing ’ s done. ” “ Absolutely . What did you give her ? ” He sagged . “ I can ’ t remember , ” he said . Getting ideas is like golf . Some days you ’ re right off , others it ’ s as easy as falling off a log . I don ’ t suppose dear old Bobbie had ever had two ideas in the same morning before in his life ; but now he did it without an effort . He just loosed another dry Martini into the undergrowth , and before you could turn round it had flushed quite a brain-wave . Do you know those little books called _When were you Born_ ? There ’ s one for each month . They tell you your character , your talents , your strong points , and your weak points at fourpence halfpenny a go . Bobbie ’ s idea was to buy the whole twelve , and go through them till we found out which month hit off Mary ’ s character . That would give us the month , and narrow it down a whole lot . A pretty hot idea for a non-thinker like dear old Bobbie . We sallied out at once . He took half and I took half , and we settled down to work . As I say , it sounded good . But when we came to go into the thing , we saw that there was a flaw . There was plenty of information all right , but there wasn ’ t a single month that didn ’ t have something that exactly hit off Mary . For instance , in the December book it said , “ December people are apt to keep their own secrets . They are extensive travellers. ” Well , Mary had certainly kept her secret , and she had travelled quite extensively enough for Bobbie ’ s needs . Then , October people were “ born with original ideas ” and “ loved moving. ” You couldn ’ t have summed up Mary ’ s little jaunt more neatly . February people had “ wonderful memories ” —Mary ’ s speciality . We took a bit of a rest , then had another go at the thing . Bobbie was all for May , because the book said that women born in that month were “ inclined to be capricious , which is always a barrier to a happy married",My Man Jeeves
George Eliot,"whose box was only silver-mounted , so that it was naturally a joke between them that Mr Tulliver wanted to exchange snuff-boxes also . Mr Deane ’ s box had been given him by the superior partners in the firm to which he belonged , at the same time that they gave him a share in the business , in acknowledgment of his valuable services as manager . No man was thought more highly of in St Ogg ’ s than Mr Deane ; and some persons were even of opinion that Miss Susan Dodson , who was once held to have made the worst match of all the Dodson sisters , might one day ride in a better carriage , and live in a better house , even than her sister Pullet . There was no knowing where a man would stop , who had got his foot into a great mill-owning , ship-owning business like that of Guest & Co. , with a banking concern attached . And Mrs Deane , as her intimate female friends observed , was proud and “ having ” enough ; _she_ wouldn ’ t let her husband stand still in the world for want of spurring . “ Maggie , ” said Mrs Tulliver , beckoning Maggie to her , and whispering in her ear , as soon as this point of Lucy ’ s staying was settled , “ go and get your hair brushed , do , for shame . I told you not to come in without going to Martha first , you know I did. ” “ Tom come out with me , ” whispered Maggie , pulling his sleeve as she passed him ; and Tom followed willingly enough . “ Come upstairs with me , Tom , ” she whispered , when they were outside the door . “ There ’ s something I want to do before dinner. ” “ There ’ s no time to play at anything before dinner , ” said Tom , whose imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect . “ Oh yes , there is time for this ; _do_ come , Tom. ” Tom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother ’ s room , and saw her go at once to a drawer , from which she took out a large pair of scissors . “ What are they for , Maggie ? ” said Tom , feeling his curiosity awakened . Maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the middle of her forehead . “ Oh , my buttons ! Maggie , you ’ ll catch it ! ” exclaimed Tom ; “ you ’ d better not cut any more off. ” Snip ! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking , and he couldn ’ t help feeling it was rather good fun ; Maggie would look so queer . “ Here , Tom , cut it behind for me , ” said Maggie , excited by her own daring , and anxious to finish the deed . “ You ’ ll catch it , you know , ” said Tom , nodding his head in an admonitory manner , and hesitating a little as he took the scissors . “ Never mind , make haste ! ” said Maggie , giving a little stamp with her foot . Her cheeks were quite flushed . The black locks were so thick , nothing could be more tempting to a lad who had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony ’ s mane . I speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of scissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair . One delicious grinding snip , and then another and another , and the hinder-locks fell heavily on the floor , and Maggie stood cropped in a jagged , uneven manner , but with a sense of clearness and freedom , as if she had emerged from a wood into the open plain . “ Oh , Maggie , ” said Tom , jumping round her , and slapping his knees as he laughed , “ Oh , my buttons ! what a queer thing you look ! Look at yourself in the glass ; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at school. ” Maggie felt an unexpected pang . She had thought beforehand chiefly at her own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it , and something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and her aunts by this very decided course of action ; she didn ’ t want her hair to look pretty , —that was out of the question , —she only wanted people to think her a clever little girl , and not to find fault with her . But now , when Tom began to laugh at her , and say she was like an idiot , the affair had quite a new aspect . She looked in the glass , and still Tom laughed and clapped his hands , and Maggie ’ s cheeks began to pale , and her lips to tremble a little . “ Oh , Maggie , you ’ ll have to go down to dinner directly , ” said Tom . “ Oh , my ! ” “ Don ’ t laugh at me , Tom , ” said Maggie , in a passionate tone , with an outburst of angry tears , stamping , and giving him a push . “ Now , then , spitfire ! ” said Tom . “ What did you cut it off for , then ? I shall go down : I can smell the dinner going in. ” He hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the irrevocable which was almost an everyday experience of her small soul . She could see clearly enough , now the thing was done , that it was very foolish , and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever ; for Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse , and then saw not only their consequences , but what would have happened if they had not been done , with all the detail and exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination . Tom never did the same sort of foolish things as Maggie , having a wonderful instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage ; and so it happened , that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie , his mother hardly ever called him naughty . But if Tom did make a mistake of that sort , he espoused it , and stood by it : he “ didn ’ t mind. ” If he broke the lash of his father ’ s gigwhip by lashing the gate , he couldn ’ t help it , —the whip shouldn ’ t have got caught in the hinge . If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate , he was convinced , not that the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act , but that he , Tom Tulliver , was justifiable in whipping that particular gate , and he wasn ’ t going to be sorry . But Maggie , as she stood crying before the glass , felt it impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts , while Tom and Lucy , and Martha , who waited at table , and perhaps her father and her uncles , would laugh at her ; for if Tom had laughed at her , of course every one else would ; and if she had only let her hair alone , she could have sat with Tom and Lucy , and had the apricot pudding and the custard ! What could she do but sob ? She sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep . Very trivial , perhaps , this anguish seems to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills , dead loves , and broken friendships ; but it was not less bitter to Maggie—perhaps it was even more bitter—than what we are fond of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life . “ Ah , my child , you will have real troubles to fret about by and by , ” is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood , and have repeated to other children since we have been grown up . We have all of us sobbed so piteously , standing with tiny bare legs above our little socks , when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place ; but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over it , as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago . Every one of those keen moments has left its trace , and lives in us still , but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and manhood ; and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain . Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood , not merely with a memory _of_ what he did and what happened to him , of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers , but with an intimate penetration , a revived consciousness of what he felt then , when it was so long from one Midsummer to another ; what he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness ; or on a rainy day in the holidays , when he didn ’ t know how to amuse himself , and fell from idleness into mischief , from mischief into defiance , and from defiance into sulkiness ; or when his mother absolutely refused to let him have a tailed coat that “ half , ” although every other boy of his age had gone into tails already ? Surely if we could recall that early bitterness , and the dim guesses , the strangely perspectiveless conception of life , that gave the bitterness its intensity , we should not pooh-pooh the griefs of our children . “ Miss Maggie , you ’ re to come down this minute , ” said Kezia , entering the room hurriedly . “ Lawks ! what have you been a-doing ? I never _see_ such a fright ! ” “ Don ’ t , Kezia , ” said Maggie , angrily . “ Go away ! ” “ But I tell you you ’ re to come down , Miss , this minute ; your mother says so , ” said Kezia , going up to Maggie and taking her by the hand to raise her from the floor . “ Get away , Kezia ; I don ’ t want any dinner , ” said Maggie , resisting Kezia ’ s arm . “ I sha ’ n ’ t come. ” “ Oh , well , I can ’ t stay . I ’ ve got to wait at dinner , ” said Kezia , going out again . “ Maggie , you little silly , ” said Tom , peeping into the room ten minutes after , “ why don ’ t you come and have your dinner ? There ’ s lots o ’ goodies , and mother says you ’ re to come . What are you crying for , you little spooney ? ” Oh , it was dreadful ! Tom was so hard and unconcerned ; if _he_ had been crying on the floor , Maggie would have cried too . And there was the dinner , so nice ; and she was _so_ hungry . It was very bitter . But Tom was not altogether hard . He was not inclined to cry , and did not feel that Maggie ’ s grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets ; but he went and put his head near her , and said in a lower , comforting tone , — “ Won ’ t you come , then , Magsie ? Shall I bring you a bit o ’ pudding when I ’ ve had mine , and a custard and things ? ” “ Ye-e-es , ” said Maggie , beginning to feel life a little more tolerable . “ Very well , ” said Tom , going away . But he turned again at the door and said , “ But you ’ d better come , you know . There ’ s the dessert , —nuts , you know , and cowslip wine. ” Maggie ’ s tears had ceased , and she looked reflective as Tom left her . His good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering , and nuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence . Slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks , and slowly she made her way downstairs . Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the dining-parlour door , peeping in when it was ajar . She saw Tom and Lucy with an empty chair between them , and there were the custards on a side-table ; it was too much . She slipped in and went toward the empty chair . But she had no sooner sat down than she repented and wished herself back again . Mrs Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her , and felt such a “ turn ” that she dropped the large gravy-spoon into the dish , with the most serious results to the table-cloth . For Kezia had not betrayed the reason of Maggie ’ s refusal to come down , not liking to give her mistress a shock in the moment of carving , and Mrs Tulliver thought there was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness , which was inflicting its own punishment by depriving Maggie of half her dinner . Mrs Tulliver ’ s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her own , and Maggie ’ s cheeks and ears began to burn , while uncle Glegg , a kind-looking , white-haired old gentleman , said , — “ Heyday ! what little gell ’ s this ? Why , I don ’ t know her . Is it some little gell you ’ ve picked up in the road , Kezia ? ” “ Why , she ’ s gone and cut her hair herself , ” said Mr Tulliver in an undertone to Mr Deane , laughing with much enjoyment . “ Did you ever know such a little hussy as it is ? ” “ Why , little miss , you ’ ve made yourself look very funny , ” said Uncle Pullet , and perhaps he never in his life made an observation which was felt to be so lacerating . “ Fie , for shame ! ” said aunt Glegg , in her loudest , severest tone of reproof . “ Little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on bread and water , —not come and sit down with their aunts and uncles. ” “ Ay , ay , ” said uncle Glegg , meaning to give a playful turn to this denunciation , “ she must be sent to jail , I think , and they ’ ll cut the rest of her hair off there , and make it all even. ” “ She ’ s more like a gypsy nor ever , ” said aunt Pullet , in a pitying tone ; “ it ’ s very bad luck , sister , as the gell should be so brown ; the boy ’ s fair enough . I doubt it ’ ll stand in her way i ’ life to be so brown. ” “ She ’ s a naughty child , as ’ ll break her mother ’ s heart , ” said Mrs Tulliver , with the tears in her eyes . Maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision . Her first flush came from anger , which gave her a transient power of defiance , and Tom thought she was braving it out , supported by the recent appearance of the pudding and custard . Under this impression , he whispered , “ Oh , my ! Maggie , I told you you ’ d catch it. ” He meant to be friendly , but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her ignominy . Her feeble power of defiance left her in an instant , her heart swelled , and getting up from her chair , she ran to her father , hid her face on his shoulder , and burst out into loud sobbing . “ Come , come , my wench , ” said her father , soothingly , putting his arm round her , “ never mind ; you was i ’ the right to cut it off if it plagued you ; give over crying ; father ’ ll take your part. ” Delicious words of tenderness ! Maggie never forgot any of these moments when her father “ took her part ” ; she kept them in her heart , and thought of them long years after , when every one else said that her father had done very ill by his children . “ How your husband does spoil that child , Bessy ! ” said Mrs Glegg , in a loud “ aside , ” to Mrs Tulliver . “ It ’ ll be the ruin of her , if you don ’ t take care . _My_ father never brought his children up so , else we should ha ’ been a different sort o ’ family to what we are. ” Mrs Tulliver ’ s domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached the point at which insensibility begins . She took no notice of her sister ’ s remark , but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the pudding , in mute resignation . With the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie , for the children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summer-house , since the day was so mild ; and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals getting from under a burning glass . Mrs Tulliver had her special reason for this permission : now the dinner was despatched , and every one ’ s mind disengaged , it was the right moment to communicate Mr Tulliver ’ s intention concerning Tom , and it would be as well for Tom himself to be absent . The children were used to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds , and could understand nothing , however they might stretch their necks and listen ; but on this occasion Mrs Tulliver manifested an unusual discretion , because she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a clergyman was a sore point with Tom , who looked at it as very much on a par with going to school to a constable . Mrs Tulliver had a sighing sense that her husband would do as he liked , whatever sister Glegg said , or sister Pullet either ; but at least they would not be able to say , if the thing turned out ill , that Bessy had fallen in with her husband ’ s folly without letting her own friends know a word about it . “ Mr Tulliver , ” she said , interrupting her husband in his talk with Mr Deane , “ it ’ s time now to tell the children ’ s aunts and uncles what you ’ re thinking of doing with Tom , isn ’ t it ? ” “ Very well , ” said Mr Tulliver , rather sharply , “ I ’ ve no objections to tell anybody what I mean to do with him . I ’ ve settled , ” he added , looking toward Mr Glegg and Mr Deane , — “ I ’ ve settled to send him to a Mr Stelling , a parson , down at King ’ s Lorton , there , —an uncommon clever fellow , I understand , as ’ ll put him up to most things. ” There was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company , such as you may have observed in a country congregation when they hear an allusion to their week-day affairs from the pulpit . It was equally astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into Mr Tulliver ’ s family arrangements . As for uncle Pullet , he could hardly have been more thoroughly obfuscated if Mr Tulliver had said that he was going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor ; for uncle Pullet belonged to that extinct class of British yeoman who , dressed in good broadcloth , paid high rates and taxes , went to church , and ate a particularly good dinner on Sunday , without dreaming that the British constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than the solar system and the fixed stars . It is melancholy , but true , that Mr Pullet had the most confused idea of a bishop as a sort of a baronet , who might or might not be a clergyman ; and as the rector of his own parish was a man of high family and fortune , the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too remote from Mr Pullet ’ s experience to be readily conceivable . I know it is difficult for people in these instructed times to believe in uncle Pullet ’ s ignorance ; but let them reflect on the remarkable results of a great natural faculty under favouring circumstances . And uncle Pullet had a great natural faculty for ignorance . He was the first to give utterance to his astonishment . “ Why , what can you be going to send him to a parson for ? ” he said , with an amazed twinkling in his eyes , looking at Mr Glegg and Mr Deane , to see if they showed any signs of comprehension . “ Why , because the parsons are the best schoolmasters , by what I can make out , ” said poor Mr Tulliver , who , in the maze of this puzzling world , laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity . “ Jacobs at th ’ academy ’ s no parson , and he ’ s done very bad by the boy ; and I made up my mind , if I send him to school again , it should be to somebody different to Jacobs . And this Mr Stelling , by what I can make out , is the sort o ’ man I want . And I mean my boy to go to him at Midsummer , ” he concluded , in a tone of decision , tapping his snuff-box and taking a pinch . “ You ’ ll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill , then , eh , Tulliver ? The clergymen have highish notions , in general , ” said Mr Deane , taking snuff vigorously , as he always did when wishing to maintain a neutral position . “ What ! do you think the parson ’ ll teach him to know a good sample o ’ wheat when he sees it , neighbour Tulliver ? ” said Mr Glegg , who was fond of his jest , and having retired from business , felt that it was not only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things . “ Why , you see , I ’ ve got a plan i ’ my head about Tom , ” said Mr Tulliver , pausing after that statement and lifting up his glass . “ Well , if I may be allowed to speak , and it ’ s seldom as I am , ” said Mrs Glegg , with a tone of bitter meaning , “ I should like to know what good is to come to the boy by bringin ’ him up above his fortin. ” “ Why , ” said Mr Tulliver , not looking at Mrs Glegg , but at the male part of his audience , “ you see , I ’ ve made up my mind not to bring Tom up to my own business . I ’ ve had my thoughts about it all along , and I made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and _his_ son . I mean to put him to some business as he can go into without capital , and I want to give him an eddication as he ’ ll be even wi ’ the lawyers and folks , and put me up to a notion now an ’ then. ” Mrs Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips , that smiled in mingled pity and scorn . “ It ’ ud be a fine deal better for some people , ” she said , after that introductory note , “ if they ’ d let the lawyers alone. ” “ Is he at the head of a grammar school , then , this clergyman , such as that at Market Bewley ? ” said Mr Deane . “ No , nothing of that , ” said Mr Tulliver . “ He won ’ t take more than two or three pupils , and so he ’ ll have the more time to attend to ’ em , you know. ” “ Ah , and get his eddication done the sooner ; they can ’ t learn much at a time when there ’ s so many of ’ em , ” said uncle Pullet , feeling that he was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter . “ But he ’ ll want the more pay , I doubt , ” said Mr Glegg . “ Ay , ay , a cool hundred a year , that ’ s all , ” said Mr Tulliver , with some pride at his own spirited course . “ But then , you know , it ’ s an investment ; Tom ’ s eddication ’ ull be so much capital to him. ” “ Ay , there ’ s something in that , ” said Mr Glegg . “ Well well , neighbour Tulliver , you may be right , you may be right : ‘ When land is gone and money ’ s spent , Then learning is most excellent. ’ “ I remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton . But us that have got no learning had better keep our money , eh , neighbour Pullet ? ” Mr Glegg rubbed his knees , and looked very pleasant . “ Mr Glegg , I wonder _at_ you , ” said his wife . “ It ’ s very unbecoming in a man o ’ your age and belongings. ” “ What ’ s unbecoming , Mrs G. ? ” said Mr Glegg , winking pleasantly at the company . “ My new blue coat as I ’ ve got on ? ” “ I pity your weakness , Mr Glegg . I say it ’ s unbecoming to be making a joke when you see your own kin going headlongs to ruin. ” “ If you mean me by that , ” said Mr Tulliver , considerably nettled , “ you needn ’ t trouble yourself to fret about me . I can manage my own affairs without troubling other folks. ” “ Bless me ! ” said Mr Deane , judiciously introducing a new idea , “ why , now I come to think of it , somebody said Wakem was going to send _his_ son—the deformed lad—to a clergyman , didn ’ t they , Susan ? ” ( appealing to his wife ) . “ I can give no account of it , I ’ m sure , ” said Mrs Deane , closing her lips very tightly again . Mrs Deane was not a woman to take part in a scene where missiles were flying . “ Well , ” said Mr Tulliver , speaking all the more cheerfully , that Mrs Glegg might see he didn ’ t mind her , “ if Wakem thinks o ’ sending his son to a clergyman , depend on it I shall make no mistake i ’ sending Tom to one . Wakem ’ s as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made , but he knows the length of every man ’ s foot he ’ s got to deal with . Ay , ay , tell me who ’ s Wakem ’ s butcher , and I ’ ll tell you where to get your meat. ” “ But lawyer Wakem ’ s son ’ s got a hump-back , ” said Mrs Pullet , who felt as if the whole business had a funereal aspect ; “ it ’ s more nat ’ ral to send _him_ to a clergyman. ” “ Yes , ” said Mr Glegg , interpreting Mrs Pullet ’ s observation with erroneous plausibility , “ you must consider that , neighbour Tulliver ; Wakem ’ s son isn ’ t likely to follow any business . Wakem ’ ull make a gentleman of him , poor fellow. ” “ Mr Glegg , ” said Mrs G. , in a tone which implied that her indignation would fizz and ooze a little , though she was determined to keep it corked up , “ you ’ d far better hold your tongue . Mr Tulliver doesn ’ t want to know your opinion nor mine either . There ’ s folks in the world as know better than everybody else. ” “ Why , I should think that ’ s you , if we ’ re to trust your own tale , ” said Mr Tulliver , beginning to boil up again . “ Oh , _I_ say nothing , ” said Mrs Glegg , sarcastically . “ My advice has never been asked , and I don ’ t give it. ” “ It ’ ll be the first time , then , ” said Mr Tulliver . “ It ’ s the only thing you ’ re over-ready at giving. ” “ I ’ ve been over-ready at lending , then , if I haven ’ t been over-ready at giving , ” said Mrs Glegg . “ There ’ s folks I ’ ve lent money to , as perhaps I shall repent o ’ lending money to kin. ” “ Come , come , come , ” said Mr Glegg , soothingly . But Mr Tulliver was not to be hindered of his retort . “ You ’ ve got a bond for it , I reckon , ” he said ; “ and you ’ ve had your five per cent , kin or no kin. ” “ Sister , ” said Mrs Tulliver , pleadingly , “ drink your wine , and let me give you some almonds and raisins. ” “ Bessy , I ’ m sorry for you , ” said Mrs Glegg , very much with the feeling of a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his bark toward the man who carries no stick . “ It ’ s poor work talking o ’ almonds and raisins. ” “ Lors , sister Glegg , don ’ t be so quarrelsome , ” said Mrs Pullet , beginning to cry a little . “ You may be struck with a fit , getting so red in the face after dinner , and we are but just out o ’ mourning , all of us , —and all wi ’ gowns craped alike and just put by ; it ’ s very bad among sisters. ” “ I should think it _is_ bad , ” said Mrs Glegg . “ Things are come to a fine pass when one sister invites the other to her house o ’ purpose to quarrel with her and abuse her. ” “ Softly , softly , Jane ; be reasonable , be reasonable , ” said Mr Glegg . But while he was speaking , Mr Tulliver , who had by no means said enough to satisfy his anger , burst out again . “ Who wants to quarrel with you ? ” he said . “ It ’ s you as can ’ t let people alone , but must be gnawing at ’ em forever . _I_ should never want to quarrel with any woman if she kept her place. ” “ My place , indeed ! ” said Mrs Glegg , getting rather more shrill . “ There ’ s your betters , Mr Tulliver , as are dead and in their grave , treated me with a different sort o ’ respect to what you do ; _though_ I ’ ve got a husband as ’ ll sit by and see me abused by them as ’ ud never ha ’ had the chance if there hadn ’ t been them in our family as married worse than they might ha ’ done. ” “ If you talk o ’ that , ” said Mr Tulliver , “ my family ’ s as good as yours , and better , for it hasn ’ t got a damned ill-tempered woman in it ! ” “ Well , ” said Mrs Glegg , rising from her chair , “ I don ’ t know whether you think it ’ s a fine thing to sit by and hear me swore at , Mr Glegg ; but I ’ m not going to stay a minute longer in this house . You can stay behind , and come home with the gig , and I ’ ll walk home. ” “ Dear heart , dear heart ! ” said Mr Glegg in a melancholy tone , as he followed his wife out of the room . “ Mr Tulliver , how could you talk so ? ” said Mrs Tulliver , with the tears in her eyes . “ Let her go , ” said Mr Tulliver , too hot to be damped by any amount of tears . “ Let her go , and the sooner the better ; she won ’ t be trying to domineer over _me_ again in a hurry. ” “ Sister Pullet , ” said Mrs Tulliver , helplessly , “ do you think it ’ ud be any use for you to go after her and try to pacify her ? ” “ Better not , better not , ” said Mr Deane . “ You ’ ll make it up another day. ” “ Then , sisters , shall we go and look at the children ? ” said Mrs Tulliver , drying her eyes . No proposition could have been more seasonable . Mr Tulliver felt very much as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women were out of the room . There were few things he liked better than a chat with Mr Deane , whose close application to business allowed the pleasure very rarely . Mr Deane , he considered , was the “ knowingest ” man of his acquaintance , and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made an agreeable supplement to Mr Tulliver ’ s own tendency that way , which had remained in rather an inarticulate condition . And now the women were gone , they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous interruption . They could exchange their views concerning the Duke of Wellington , whose conduct in the Catholic Question had thrown such an entirely new light on his character ; and speak slightingly of his conduct at the battle of Waterloo , which he would never have won if there hadn ’ t been a great many Englishmen at his back , not to speak of Blucher and the Prussians , who , as Mr Tulliver had heard from a person of particular knowledge in that matter , had come up in the very nick of time ; though here there was a slight dissidence , Mr Deane remarking that he was not disposed to give much credit to the Prussians , —the build of their vessels , together with the unsatisfactory character of transactions in Dantzic beer , inclining him to form rather a low view of Prussian pluck generally . Rather beaten on this ground , Mr Tulliver proceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be what it used to be ; but Mr Deane , attached to a firm of which the returns were on the increase , naturally took a more lively view of the present , and had some details to give concerning the state of the imports , especially in hides and spelter , which soothed Mr Tulliver ’ s imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals , and there would be no more chance for honest men . Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters . He didn ’ t understand politics himself , —thought they were a natural gift , —but by what he could make out , this Duke of Wellington was no better than he should be . Chapter VIII . Mr Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side “ Suppose sister Glegg should call her money in ; it ’ ud be very awkward for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now , ” said Mrs Tulliver to her husband that evening , as she took a plaintive review of the day . Mrs Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband , yet she retained in all the freshness of her early married life a facility of saying things which drove him in the opposite direction to the one she desired . Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way , as a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful illusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling glass . Mrs Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind , and after running her head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go at it again to-day with undulled alacrity . This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr Tulliver that it would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds ; and when Mrs Tulliver became rather pressing to know _how_ he would raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he never _would_ mortgage , since nowadays people were none so ready to lend money without security , Mr Tulliver , getting warm , declared that Mrs Glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money , he should pay it in whether or not . He was not going to be beholden to his wife ’ s sisters . When a man had married into a family where there was a whole litter of women , he might have plenty to put up with if he chose . But Mr Tulliver did _not_ choose . Mrs Tulliver cried a little in a trickling , quiet way as she put on her nightcap ; but presently sank into a comfortable sleep , lulled by the thought that she would talk everything over with her sister Pullet to-morrow , when she was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea . Not that she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk ; but it seemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain unmodified when they were complained against . Her husband lay awake rather longer , for he too was thinking of a visit he would pay on the morrow ; and his ideas on the subject were not of so vague and soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner . Mr Tulliver , when under the influence of a strong feeling , had a promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful sense of the complicated , puzzling nature of human affairs under which his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted ; but it is really not improbable that there was a direct relation between these apparently contradictory phenomena , since I have observed that for getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing like snatching hastily at a single thread . It was owing to this promptitude that Mr Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the next day ( he was not dyspeptic ) on his way to Basset to see his sister Moss and her husband . For having made up his mind irrevocably that he would pay Mrs Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds , it naturally occurred to him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds lent to his brother-in-law Moss ; and if the said brother-in-law could manage to pay in the money within a given time , it would go far to lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which Mr Tulliver ’ s spirited step might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require to know precisely _how_ a thing is to be done before they are strongly confident that it will be easy . For Mr Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking , but , like other everyday things , sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the long run : he was held to be a much more substantial man than he really was . And as we are all apt to believe what the world believes about us , it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with which a spare , long-necked man hears that his plethoric short-necked neighbour is stricken with apoplexy . He had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a man who worked his own mill , and owned a pretty bit of land ; and these jokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of considerable substance . They gave a pleasant flavour to his glass on a market-day , and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments , Mr Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold . That was not altogether his own fault , since one of the thousand pounds was his sister ’ s fortune , which he had to pay on her marriage ; and a man who has neighbours that _will_ go to law with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages , especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be represented by parchment . Our friend Mr Tulliver had a good-natured fibre in him , and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his sister , who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way characteristic of sisters , creating a necessity for mortgages , but had quite thrown herself away in marriage , and had crowned her mistakes by having an eighth baby . On this point Mr Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak ; but he apologised to himself by saying that poor Gritty had been a good-looking wench before she married Moss ; he would sometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice . But this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business , and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes , with their deep ruts , —lying so far away from a market-town that the labour of drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made of , —he got up a due amount of irritation against Moss as a man without capital , who , if murrain and blight were abroad , was sure to have his share of them , and who , the more you tried to help him out of the mud , would sink the further in . It would do him good rather than harm , now , if he were obliged to raise this three hundred pounds ; it would make him look about him better , and not act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last ; in fact , Mr Tulliver had been too easy with his brother-in-law , and because he had let the interest run on for two years , Moss was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal . But Mr Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer ; and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate a man ’ s resolution by softening his temper . The deep-trodden hoof-marks , made in the muddiest days of winter , gave him a shake now and then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers , who , whether by means of his hoof or otherwise , had doubtless something to do with this state of the roads ; and the abundance of foul land and neglected fences that met his eye , though they made no part of his brother Moss ’ s farm , strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist . If this wasn ’ t Moss ’ s fallow , it might have been ; Basset was all alike ; it was a beggarly parish , in Mr Tulliver ’ s opinion , and his opinion was certainly not groundless . Basset had a poor soil , poor roads , a poor non-resident landlord , a poor non-resident vicar , and rather less than half a curate , also poor . If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people , I have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition ; I only know that , in point of fact , the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances . The muddy lanes , green or clayey , that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other , did really lead , with patience , to a distant high-road ; but there were many feet in Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation , spoken of formerly as the “ Markis o ’ Granby , ” but among intimates as “ Dickison ’ s. ” A large low room with a sanded floor ; a cold scent of tobacco , modified by undetected beer-dregs ; Mr Dickison leaning against the door-post with a melancholy pimpled face , looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last night ’ s guttered candle , —all this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation ; but the majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four o ’ clock on a wintry afternoon ; and if any wife in Basset wished to indicate that her husband was not a pleasure-seeking man , she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didn ’ t spend a shilling at Dickison ’ s from one Whitsuntide to another . Mrs Moss had said so of _her_ husband more than once , when her brother was in a mood to find fault with him , as he certainly was to-day . And nothing could be less pacifying to Mr Tulliver than the behaviour of the farmyard gate , which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do , to the peril of shins , whether equine or human . He was about to get down and lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard , shadowed drearily by the large half-timbered buildings , up to the long line of tumble-down dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway ; but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he had determined on , —namely , not to get down from his horse during this visit . If a man means to be hard , let him keep in his saddle and speak from that height , above the level of pleading eyes , and with the command of a distant horizon . Mrs Moss heard the sound of the horse ’ s feet , and , when her brother rode up , was already outside the kitchen door , with a half-weary smile on her face , and a black-eyed baby in her arms . Mrs Moss ’ s face bore a faded resemblance to her brother ’ s ; baby ’ s little fat hand , pressed against her cheek , seemed to show more strikingly that the cheek was faded . “ Brother , I ’ m glad to see you , ” she said , in an affectionate tone . “ I didn ’ t look for you to-day . How do you do ? ” “ Oh , pretty well , Mrs Moss , pretty well , ” answered the brother , with cool deliberation , as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that question . She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humour ; he never called her Mrs Moss except when he was angry , and when they were in company . But she thought it was in the order of nature that people who were poorly off should be snubbed . Mrs Moss did not take her stand on the equality of the human race ; she was a patient , prolific , loving-hearted woman . “ Your husband isn ’ t in the house , I suppose ? ” added Mr Tulliver after a grave pause , during which four children had run out , like chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen-coop . “ No , ” said Mrs Moss , “ but he ’ s only in the potato-field yonders . Georgy , run to the Far Close in a minute , and tell father your uncle ’ s come . You ’ ll get down , brother , won ’ t you , and take something ? ” “ No , no ; I can ’ t get down . I must be going home again directly , ” said Mr Tulliver , looking at the distance . “ And how ’ s Mrs Tulliver and the children ? ” said Mrs Moss , humbly , not daring to press her invitation . “ Oh , pretty well . Tom ’ s going to a new school at Midsummer , —a deal of expense to me . It ’ s bad work for me , lying out o ’ my money. ” “ I wish you ’ d be so good as let the children come and see their cousins some day . My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never was . And me her godmother , and so fond of her ; there ’ s nobody ’ ud make a bigger fuss with her , according to what they ’ ve got . And I know she likes to come , for she ’ s a loving child , and how quick and clever she is , to be sure ! ” If Mrs Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world , instead of being one of the simplest , she could have thought of nothing more likely to propitiate her brother than this praise of Maggie . He seldom found any one volunteering praise of “ the little wench ” ; it was usually left entirely to himself to insist on her merits . But Maggie always appeared in the most amiable light at her aunt Moss ’ s ; it was her Alsatia , where she was out of the reach of law , —if she upset anything , dirtied her shoes , or tore her frock , these things were matters of course at her aunt Moss ’ s . In spite of himself , Mr Tulliver ’ s eyes got milder , and he did not look away from his sister as he said , — “ Ay ; she ’ s fonder o ’ you than o ’ the other aunts , I think . She takes after our family : not a bit of her mother ’ s in her. ” “ Moss says she ’ s just like what I used to be , ” said Mrs Moss , “ though I was never so quick and fond o ’ the books . But I think my Lizzy ’ s like her ; _she ’ s_ sharp . Come here , Lizzy , my dear , and let your uncle see you ; he hardly knows you , you grow so fast. ” Lizzy , a black-eyed child of seven , looked very shy when her mother drew her forward , for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle from Dorlcote Mill . She was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely flattering to Mr Tulliver ’ s fatherly love . “ Ay , they ’ re a bit alike , ” he said , looking kindly at the little figure in the soiled pinafore . “ They both take after our mother . You ’ ve got enough o ’ gells , Gritty , ” he added , in a tone half compassionate , half reproachful . “ Four of ’ em , bless ’ em ! ” said Mrs Moss , with a sigh , stroking Lizzy ’ s hair on each side of her forehead ; “ as many as there ’ s boys . They ’ ve got a brother apiece. ” “ Ah , but they must turn out and fend for themselves , ” said Mr Tulliver , feeling that his severity was relaxing and trying to brace it by throwing out a wholesome hint “ They mustn ’ t look to hanging on their brothers. ” “ No ; but I hope their brothers ’ ull love the poor things , and remember they came o ’ one father and mother ; the lads ’ ull never be the poorer for that , ” said Mrs Moss , flashing out with hurried timidity , like a half-smothered fire . Mr Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank , then checked it , and said angrily , “ Stand still with you ! ” much to the astonishment of that innocent animal . “ And the more there is of ’ em , the more they must love one another , ” Mrs Moss went on , looking at her children with a didactic purpose . But she turned toward her brother again to say , “ Not but what I hope your boy ’ ull allays be good to his sister , though there ’ s but two of ’ em , like you and me , brother. ” The arrow went straight to Mr Tulliver ’ s heart . He had not a rapid imagination , but the thought of Maggie was very near to him , and he was not long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with Tom ’ s relation to Maggie . Would the little wench ever be poorly off , and Tom rather hard upon her ? “ Ay , ay , Gritty , ” said the miller , with a new softness in his tone ; “ but I ’ ve allays done what I could for you , ” he added , as if vindicating himself from a reproach . “ I ’ m not denying that , brother , and I ’ m noways ungrateful , ” said poor Mrs Moss , too fagged by toil and children to have strength left for any pride . “ But here ’ s the father . What a while you ’ ve been , Moss ! ” “ While , do you call it ? ” said Mr Moss , feeling out of breath and injured . “ I ’ ve been running all the way . Won ’ t you ’ light , Mr Tulliver ? ” “ Well , I ’ ll just get down and have a bit o ’ talk with you in the garden , ” said Mr Tulliver , thinking that he should be more likely to show a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not present . He got down , and passed with Mr Moss into the garden , toward an old yew-tree arbour , while his sister stood tapping her baby on the back and looking wistfully after them . Their entrance into the yew-tree arbour surprised several fowls that were recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty ground , and at once took flight with much pother and cackling . Mr Tulliver sat down on the bench , and tapping the ground curiously here and there with his stick , as if he suspected some hollowness , opened the conversation by observing , with something like a snarl in his tone , — “ Why , you ’ ve got wheat again in that Corner Close , I see ; and never a bit o ’ dressing on it . You ’ ll do no good with it this year. ” Mr Moss , who , when he married Miss Tulliver , had been regarded as the buck of Basset , now wore a beard nearly a week old , and had the depressed , unexpectant air of a machine-horse . He answered in a patient-grumbling tone , “ Why , poor farmers like me must do as they can ; they must leave it to them as have got money to play with , to put half as much into the ground as they mean to get out of it. ” “ I don ’ t know who should have money to play with , if it isn ’ t them as can borrow money without paying interest , ” said Mr Tulliver , who wished to get into a slight quarrel ; it was the most natural and easy introduction to calling in money . “ I know I ’ m behind with the interest , ” said Mr Moss , “ but I was so unlucky wi ’ the wool last year ; and what with the Missis being laid up so , things have gone awk ’ arder nor usual. ” “ Ay , ” snarled Mr Tulliver , “ there ’ s folks as things ’ ull allays go awk ’ ard with ; empty sacks ’ ull never stand upright. ” “ Well , I don ’ t know what fault you ’ ve got to find wi ’ me , Mr Tulliver , ” said Mr Moss , deprecatingly ; “ I know there isn ’ t a day-labourer works harder. ” “ What ’ s the use o ’ that , ” said Mr Tulliver , sharply , “ when a man marries , and ’ s got no capital to work his farm but his wife ’ s bit o ’ fortin ? I was against it from the first ; but you ’ d neither of you listen to me . And I can ’ t lie out o ’ my money any longer , for I ’ ve got to pay five hundred o ’ Mrs Glegg ’ s , and there ’ ll be Tom an expense to me . I should find myself short , even saying I ’ d got back all as is my own . You must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred pound. ” “ Well , if that ’ s what you mean , ” said Mr Moss , looking blankly before him , “ we ’ d better be sold up , and ha ’ done with it ; I must part wi ’ every head o ’ stock I ’ ve got , to pay you and the landlord too. ” Poor relations are undeniably irritating , —their existence is so entirely uncalled for on our part , and they are almost always very faulty people . Mr Tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much irritated with Mr Moss as he had desired , and he was able to say angrily , rising from his seat , — “ Well , you must do as you can . _I_ can ’ t find money for everybody else as well as myself . I must look to my own business and my own family . I can ’ t lie out o ’ my money any longer . You must raise it as quick as you can. ” Mr Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbour as he uttered the last sentence , and , without looking round at Mr Moss , went on to the kitchen door , where the eldest boy was holding his horse , and his sister was waiting in a state of wondering alarm , which was not without its alleviations , for baby was making pleasant gurgling sounds , and performing a great deal of finger practice on the faded face . Mrs Moss had eight children , but could never overcome her regret that the twins had not lived . Mr Moss thought their removal was not without its consolations . “ Won ’ t you come in , brother ? ” she said , looking anxiously at her husband , who was walking slowly up , while Mr Tulliver had his foot already in the stirrup . “ No , no ; good-by , ” said he , turning his horse ’ s head , and riding away . No man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate , and a little way along the deep-rutted lane ; but before he reached the next turning , which would take him out of sight of the dilapidated farm-buildings , he appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought . He checked his horse , and made it stand still in the same spot for two or three minutes , during which he turned his head from side to side in a melancholy way , as if he were looking at some painful object on more sides than one . Evidently , after his fit of promptitude , Mr Tulliver was relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world . He turned his horse , and rode slowly back , giving vent to the climax of feeling which had determined this movement by saying aloud , as he struck his horse , “ Poor little wench ! she ’ ll have nobody but Tom , belike , when I ’ m gone. ” Mr Tulliver ’ s return into the yard was descried by several young Mosses , who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother , so that Mrs Moss was again on the door-step when her brother rode up . She had been crying , but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now , and made no ostentatious show of sorrow as her brother looked at her , but merely said : “ The father ’ s gone to the field , again , if you want him , brother. ” “ No , Gritty , no , ” said Mr Tulliver , in a gentle tone . “ Don ’ t you fret , —that ’ s all , —I ’ ll make a shift without the money a bit , only you must be as clever and contriving as you can. ” Mrs Moss ’ s tears came again at this unexpected kindness , and she could say nothing . “ Come , come ! —the little wench shall come and see you . I ’ ll bring her and Tom some day before he goes to school . You mustn ’ t fret . I ’ ll allays be a good brother to you. ” “ Thank you for that word , brother , ” said Mrs Moss , drying her tears ; then turning to Lizzy , she said , “ Run now , and fetch the coloured egg for cousin Maggie. ” Lizzy ran in , and quickly reappeared with a small paper parcel . “ It ’ s boiled hard , brother , and coloured with thrums , very pretty ; it was done o ’ purpose for Maggie . Will you please to carry it in your pocket ? ” “ Ay , ay , ” said Mr Tulliver , putting it carefully in his side pocket . “ Good-by. ” And so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather more puzzled than before as to ways and means , but still with the sense of a danger escaped . It had come across his mind that if he were hard upon his sister , it might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon Maggie at some distant day , when her father was no longer there to take her part ; for simple people , like our friend Mr Tulliver , are apt to clothe unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas , and this was his confused way of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety for “ the little wench ” had given him a new sensibility toward his sister . Chapter IX . To Garum Firs While the possible troubles of Maggie ’ s future were occupying her father ’ s mind , she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the present . Childhood has no forebodings ; but then , it is soothed by no memories of outlived sorrow . The fact was , the day had begun ill with Maggie . The pleasure of having Lucy to look at , and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs , where she would hear uncle Pullet ’ s musical box , had been marred as early as eleven o ’ clock by the advent of the hair-dresser from St Ogg ’ s , who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which he had found her hair , holding up one jagged lock after another and saying , “ See here ! tut , tut , tut ! ” in a tone of mingled disgust and pity , which to Maggie ’ s imagination was equivalent to the strongest expression of public opinion . Mr Rappit , the hair-dresser , with his well-anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward , like the simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn , seemed to her at that moment the most formidable of her contemporaries , into whose street at St Ogg ’ s she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life . Moreover , the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the Dodson family , Martha was enjoined to have Mrs Tulliver ’ s room ready an hour earlier than usual , that the laying out of the best clothes might not be deferred till the last moment , as was sometimes the case in families of lax views , where the ribbon-strings were never rolled up , where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper , and where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily produced no shock to the mind . Already , at twelve o ’ clock , Mrs Tulliver had on her visiting costume , with a protective apparatus of brown holland , as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of flies ; Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders , that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers , while her mother was remonstrating , “ Don ’ t , Maggie , my dear ; don ’ t make yourself so ugly ! ” and Tom ’ s cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a relief to his best blue suit , which he wore with becoming calmness , having , after a little wrangling , effected what was always the one point of interest to him in his toilet : he had transferred all the contents of his everyday pockets to those actually in wear . As for Lucy , she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday ; no accidents ever happened to her clothes , and she was never uncomfortable in them , so that she looked with wondering pity at Maggie , pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker . Maggie would certainly have torn it off , if she had not been checked by the remembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair ; as it was , she confined herself to fretting and twisting , and behaving peevishly about the card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner , as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes . Tom could build perfect pyramids of houses ; but Maggie ’ s would never bear the laying on the roof . It was always so with the things that Maggie made ; and Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make anything . But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at building ; she handled the cards so lightly , and moved so gently , that Tom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own , the more readily because she had asked him to teach her . Maggie , too , would have admired Lucy ’ s houses , and would have given up her own unsuccessful building to contemplate them , without ill temper , if her tucker had not made her peevish , and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her houses fell , and told her she was “ a stupid. ” “ Don ’ t laugh at me , Tom ! ” she burst out angrily ; “ I ’ m not a stupid . I know a great many things you don ’ t. ” “ Oh , I dare say , Miss Spitfire ! I ’ d never be such a cross thing as you , making faces like that . Lucy doesn ’ t do so . I like Lucy better than you ; _I_ wish Lucy was _my_ sister. ” “ Then it ’ s very wicked and cruel of you to wish so , ” said Maggie , starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor , and upsetting Tom ’ s wonderful pagoda . She really did not mean it , but the circumstantial evidence was against her , and Tom turned white with anger , but said nothing ; he would have struck her , only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl , and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do anything cowardly . Maggie stood in dismay and terror , while Tom got up from the floor and walked away , pale , from the scattered ruins of his pagoda , and Lucy looked on mutely , like a kitten pausing from its lapping . “ Oh , Tom , ” said Maggie , at last , going half-way toward him , “ I didn ’ t mean to knock it down , indeed , indeed I didn ’ t. ” Tom took no notice of her , but took , instead , two or three hard peas out of his pocket , and shot them with his thumbnail against the window , vaguely at first , but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a superannuated blue-bottle which was exposing its imbecility in the spring sunshine , clearly against the views of Nature , who had provided Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual . Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie , and Tom ’ s persistent coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her . He called Lucy to look at the half-built bird ’ s nest without caring to show it Maggie , and peeled a willow switch for Lucy and himself , without offering one to Maggie . Lucy had said , “ Maggie , shouldn ’ t _you_ like one ? ” but Tom was deaf . Still , the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the stackyard wall , just as they reached Garum Firs , was enough to divert the mind temporarily from personal grievances . And this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs . All the farmyard life was wonderful there , —bantams , speckled and top-knotted ; Friesland hens , with their feathers all turned the wrong way ; Guinea-fowls that flew and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers ; pouter-pigeons and a tame magpie ; nay , a goat , and a wonderful brindled dog , half mastiff , half bull-dog , as large as a lion . Then there were white railings and white gates all about , and glittering weathercocks of various design , and garden-walks paved with pebbles in beautiful patterns , —nothing was quite common at Garum Firs ; and Tom thought that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general unusualness which characterised uncle Pullet ’ s possessions as a gentleman farmer . Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner . As for the house , it was not less remarkable ; it had a receding centre , and two wings with battlemented turrets , and was covered with glittering white stucco . Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window , and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door , kept always in this fortified condition from fear of tramps , who might be supposed to know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall , and to contemplate rushing in and carrying it away on their heads . Aunt Pullet , too , appeared at the doorway , and as soon as her sister was within hearing said , “ Stop the children , for God ’ s sake ! Bessy ; don ’ t let ’ em come up the door-steps ; Sally ’ s bringing the old mat and the duster , to rub their shoes. ” Mrs Pullet ’ s front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on ; the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work . Tom rebelled particularly against this shoewiping , which he always considered in the light of an indignity to his sex . He felt it as the beginning of the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet ’ s , where he had once been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots ; a fact which may serve to correct the too hasty conclusion that a visit to Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of animals , —fond , that is , of throwing stones at them . The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions ; it was the mounting of the polished oak stairs , which had very handsome carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom , so that the ascent of these glossy steps might have served , in barbarous times , as a trial by ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs . Sophy ’ s weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs Glegg ’ s part ; but Mrs Tulliver ventured on no comment , only thinking to herself it was a mercy when she and the children were safe on the landing . “ Mrs Gray has sent home my new bonnet , Bessy , ” said Mrs Pullet , in a pathetic tone , as Mrs Tulliver adjusted her cap . “ Has she , sister ? ” said Mrs Tulliver , with an air of much interest . “ And how do you like it ? ” “ It ’ s apt to make a mess with clothes , taking ’ em out and putting ’ em in again , ” said Mrs Pullet , drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly , “ but it ’ ud be a pity for you to go away without seeing it . There ’ s no knowing what may happen. ” Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration , which determined her to single out a particular key . “ I ’ m afraid it ’ ll be troublesome to you getting it out , sister , ” said Mrs Tulliver ; “ but I _should_ like to see what sort of a crown she ’ s made you. ” Mrs Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright wardrobe , where you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet . Not at all . Such a supposition could only have arisen from a too superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family . In this wardrobe Mrs Pullet was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of linen , —it was a door-key . “ You must come with me into the best room , ” said Mrs Pullet . “ May the children come too , sister ? ” inquired Mrs Tulliver , who saw that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager . “ Well , ” said aunt Pullet , reflectively , “ it ’ ll perhaps be safer for ’ em to come ; they ’ ll be touching something if we leave ’ em behind. ” So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor , dimly lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the closed shutter ; it was really quite solemn . Aunt Pullet paused and unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the passage , —a darkened room , in which the outer light , entering feebly , showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds . Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward . Lucy laid hold of Maggie ’ s frock , and Maggie ’ s heart beat rapidly . Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe , with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the funereal solemnity of the scene . The delicious scent of rose-leaves that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at , though the sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie , who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural . But few things could have been more impressive to Mrs Tulliver . She looked all round it in silence for some moments , and then said emphatically , “ Well , sister , I ’ ll never speak against the full crowns again ! ” It was a great concession , and Mrs Pullet felt it ; she felt something was due to it . “ You ’ d like to see it on , sister ? ” she said sadly . “ I ’ ll open the shutter a bit further. ” “ Well , if you don ’ t mind taking off your cap , sister , ” said Mrs Tulliver . Mrs Pullet took off her cap , displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of those times , and placing the bonnet on her head , turned slowly round , like a draper ’ s lay-figure , that Mrs Tulliver might miss no point of view . “ I ’ ve sometimes thought there ’ s a loop too much o ’ ribbon on this left side , sister ; what do you think ? ” said Mrs Pullet . Mrs Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated , and turned her head on one side . “ Well , I think it ’ s best as it is ; if you meddled with it , sister , you might repent. ” “ That ’ s true , ” said aunt Pullet , taking off the bonnet and looking at it contemplatively . “ How much might she charge you for that bonnet , sister ? ” said Mrs Tulliver , whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting a humble imitation of this _chef-d ’ œuvre_ made from a piece of silk she had at home . Mrs Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head , and then whispered , “ Pullet pays for it ; he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum Church , let the next best be whose it would. ” She began slowly to adjust the trimmings , in preparation for returning it to its place in the wardrobe , and her thoughts seemed to have taken a melancholy turn , for she shook her head . “ Ah , ” she said at last , “ I may never wear it twice , sister ; who knows ? ” “ Don ’ t talk o ’ that sister , ” answered Mrs Tulliver . “ I hope you ’ ll have your health this summer. ” “ Ah ! but there may come a death in the family , as there did soon after I had my green satin bonnet . Cousin Abbott may go , and we can ’ t think o ’ wearing crape less nor half a year for him. ” “ That _would_ be unlucky , ” said Mrs Tulliver , entering thoroughly into the possibility of an inopportune decease . “ There ’ s never so much pleasure i ’ wearing a bonnet the second year , especially when the crowns are so chancy , —never two summers alike. ” “ Ah , it ’ s the way i ’ this world , ” said Mrs Pullet , returning the bonnet to the wardrobe and locking it up . She maintained a silence characterised by head-shaking , until they had all issued from the solemn chamber and were in her own room again . Then , beginning to cry , she said , “ Sister , if you should never see that bonnet again till I ’ m dead and gone , you ’ ll remember I showed it you this day. ” Mrs Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected , but she was a woman of sparse tears , stout and healthy ; she couldn ’ t cry so much as her sister Pullet did , and had often felt her deficiency at funerals . Her effort to bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face . Maggie , looking on attentively , felt that there was some painful mystery about her aunt ’ s bonnet which she was considered too young to understand ; indignantly conscious , all the while , that she could have understood that , as well as everything else , if she had been taken into confidence . When they went down , uncle Pullet observed , with some acumen , that he reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet , —that was what had made them so long upstairs . With Tom the interval had seemed still longer , for he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa directly opposite his uncle Pullet , who regarded him with twinkling gray eyes , and occasionally addressed him as “ Young sir. ” “ Well , young sir , what do you learn at school ? ” was a standing question with uncle Pullet ; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish , rubbed his hands across his face , and answered , “ I don ’ t know. ” It was altogether so embarrassing to be seated _tête-à-tête_ with uncle Pullet , that Tom could not even look at the prints on the walls , or the flycages , or the wonderful flower-pots ; he saw nothing but his uncle ’ s gaiters . Not that Tom was in awe of his uncle ’ s mental superiority ; indeed , he had made up his mind that he didn ’ t want to be a gentleman farmer , because he shouldn ’ t like to be such a thin-legged , silly fellow as his uncle Pullet , —a molly-coddle , in fact . A boy ’ s sheepishness is by no means a sign of overmastering reverence ; and while you are making encouraging advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and wisdom , ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer . The only consolation I can suggest to you is , that the Greek boys probably thought the same of Aristotle . It is only when you have mastered a restive horse , or thrashed a drayman , or have got a gun in your hand , that these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character . At least , I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver ’ s sentiments on these points . In very tender years , when he still wore a lace border under his outdoor cap , he was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr , intended to strike terror into their astonished minds ; indicating thus early that desire for mastery over the inferior animals , wild and domestic , including cockchafers , neighbours ’ dogs , and small sisters , which in all ages has been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race . Now , Mr Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony , and was the least predatory of men , considering firearms dangerous , as apt to go off of themselves by nobody ’ s particular desire . So that Tom was not without strong reasons when , in confidential talk with a chum , he had described uncle Pullet as a nincompoop , taking care at the same time to observe that he was a very “ rich fellow. ” The only alleviating circumstance in a _tête-à-tête_ with uncle Pullet was that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his person , and when at a loss for conversation , he filled up the void by proposing a mutual solace of this kind . “ Do you like peppermints , young sir ? ” required only a tacit answer when it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question . The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the further solace of small sweet-cakes , of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days ; but the three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their fingers , than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came , since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor “ all over ” crumbs . Lucy didn ’ t mind that much , for the cake was so pretty , she thought it was rather a pity to eat it ; but Tom , watching his opportunity while the elders were talking , hastily stowed it in his mouth at two bites , and chewed it furtively . As for Maggie , becoming fascinated , as usual , by a print of Ulysses and Nausicaa , which uncle Pullet had bought as a “ pretty Scripture thing , ” she presently let fall her cake , and in an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foot , —a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet and conscious disgrace to Maggie , that she began to despair of hearing the musical snuff-box to-day , till , after some reflection , it occurred to her that Lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a tune . So she whispered to Lucy ; and Lucy , who always did what she was desired to do , went up quietly to her uncle ’ s knee , and blushing all over her neck while she fingered her necklace , said , “ Will you please play us a tune , uncle ? ” Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle Pullet that the snuff-box played such beautiful tunes , and indeed the thing was viewed in that light by the majority of his neighbours in Garum . Mr Pullet had _bought_ the box , to begin with , and he understood winding it up , and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand ; altogether the possession of this unique “ piece of music ” was a proof that Mr Pullet ’ s character was not of that entire nullity which might otherwise have been attributed to it . But uncle Pullet , when entreated to exhibit his accomplishment , never depreciated it by a too ready consent . “ We ’ ll see about it , ” was the answer he always gave , carefully abstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable number of minutes had passed . Uncle Pullet had a programme for all great social occasions , and in this way fenced himself in from much painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will . Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie ’ s enjoyment when the fairy tune began ; for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind , that Tom was angry with her ; and by the time “ Hush , ye pretty warbling choir , ” had been played , her face wore that bright look of happiness , while she sat immovable with her hands clasped , which sometimes comforted her mother with the sense that Maggie could look pretty now and then , in spite of her brown skin . But when the magic music ceased , she jumped up , and running toward Tom , put her arm round his neck and said , “ Oh , Tom , isn ’ t it pretty ? ” Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that he felt any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and , to him , inexplicable caress , I must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand , and that she jerked him so as to make him spill half of it . He must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily , “ Look there , now ! ” especially when his resentment was sanctioned , as it was , by general disapprobation of Maggie ’ s behaviour . “ Why don ’ t you sit still , Maggie ? ” her mother said peevishly . “ Little gells mustn ’ t come to see me if they behave in that way , ” said aunt Pullet . “ Why , you ’ re too rough , little miss , ” said uncle Pullet . Poor Maggie sat down again , with the music all chased out of her soul , and the seven small demons all in again . Mrs Tulliver , foreseeing nothing but misbehaviour while the children remained indoors , took an early opportunity of suggesting that , now they were rested after their walk , they might go and play out of doors ; and aunt Pullet gave permission , only enjoining them not to go off the paved walks in the garden , and if they wanted to see the poultry fed , to view them from a distance on the horse-block ; a restriction which had been imposed ever since Tom had been found guilty of running after the peacock , with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its feathers drop off . Mrs Tulliver ’ s thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel with Mrs Glegg by millinery and maternal cares , but now the great theme of the bonnet was thrown into perspective , and the children were out of the way , yesterday ’ s anxieties recurred . “ It weighs on my mind so as never was , ” she said , by way of opening the subject , “ sister Glegg ’ s leaving the house in that way . I ’ m sure I ’ d no wish t ’ offend a sister. ” “ Ah , ” said aunt Pullet , “ there ’ s no accounting for what Jane ’ ull do . I wouldn ’ t speak of it out o ’ the family , if it wasn ’ t to Dr Turnbull ; but it ’ s my belief Jane lives too low . I ’ ve said so to Pullet often and often , and he knows it. ” “ Why , you said so last Monday was a week , when we came away from drinking tea with ’ em , ” said Mr Pullet , beginning to nurse his knee and shelter it with his pocket handkerchief , as was his way when the conversation took an interesting turn . “ Very like I did , ” said Mrs Pullet , “ for you remember when I said things , better than I can remember myself . He ’ s got a wonderful memory , Pullet has , ” she continued , looking pathetically at her sister . “ I should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke , for he always remembers when I ’ ve got to take my doctor ’ s stuff ; and I ’ m taking three sorts now. ” “ There ’ s the ‘ pills as before ’ every other night , and the new drops at eleven and four , and the ’ fervescing mixture ‘ when agreeable , ’ ” rehearsed Mr Pullet , with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on his tongue . “ Ah , perhaps it ’ ud be better for sister Glegg if _she ’ d_ go to the doctor sometimes , instead o ’ chewing Turkey rhubarb whenever there ’ s anything the matter with her , ” said Mrs Tulliver , who naturally saw the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to Mrs Glegg . “ It ’ s dreadful to think on , ” said aunt Pullet , raising her hands and letting them fall again , “ people playing with their own insides in that way ! And it ’ s flying i ’ the face o ’ Providence ; for what are the doctors for , if we aren ’ t to call ’ em in ? And when folks have got the money to pay for a doctor , it isn ’ t respectable , as I ’ ve told Jane many a time . I ’ m ashamed of acquaintance knowing it. ” “ Well , _we ’ ve_ no call to be ashamed , ” said Mr Pullet , “ for Doctor Turnbull hasn ’ t got such another patient as you i ’ this parish , now old Mrs Sutton ’ s gone. ” “ Pullet keeps all my physic-bottles , did you know , Bessy ? ” said Mrs Pullet . “ He won ’ t have one sold . He says it ’ s nothing but right folks should see ’ em when I ’ m gone . They fill two o ’ the long store-room shelves a ’ ready ; but , ” she added , beginning to cry a little , “ it ’ s well if they ever fill three . I may go before I ’ ve made up the dozen o ’ these last sizes . The pill-boxes are in the closet in my room , —you ’ ll remember that , sister , —but there ’ s nothing to show for the boluses , if it isn ’ t the bills. ” “ Don ’ t talk o ’ your going , sister , ” said Mrs Tulliver ; “ I should have nobody to stand between me and sister Glegg if you was gone . And there ’ s nobody but you can get her to make it up with Mr Tulliver , for sister Deane ’ s never o ’ my side , and if she was , it ’ s not to be looked for as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin. ” “ Well , your husband _is_ awk ’ ard , you know , Bessy , ” said Mrs Pullet , good-naturedly ready to use her deep depression on her sister ’ s account as well as her own . “ He ’ s never behaved quite so pretty to our family as he should do , and the children take after him , —the boy ’ s very mischievous , and runs away from his aunts and uncles , and the gell ’ s rude and brown . It ’ s your bad luck , and I ’ m sorry for you , Bessy ; for you was allays my favourite sister , and we allays liked the same patterns. ” “ I know Tulliver ’ s hasty , and says odd things , ” said Mrs Tulliver , wiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye ; “ but I ’ m sure he ’ s never been the man , since he married me , to object to my making the friends o ’ my side o ’ the family welcome to the house. ” “ _I_ don ’ t want to make the worst of you , Bessy , ” said Mrs Pullet , compassionately , “ for I doubt you ’ ll have trouble enough without that ; and your husband ’ s got that poor sister and her children hanging on him , —and so given to lawing , they say . I doubt he ’ ll leave you poorly off when he dies . Not as I ’ d have it said out o ’ the family. ” This view of her position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs Tulliver . Her imagination was not easily acted on , but she could not help thinking that her case was a hard one , since it appeared that other people thought it hard . “ I ’ m sure , sister , I can ’ t help myself , ” she said , urged by the fear lest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive , to take comprehensive review of her past conduct . “ There ’ s no woman strives more for her children ; and I ’ m sure at scouring-time this Lady-day as I ’ ve had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells put together ; and there ’ s the last elder-flower wine I ’ ve made—beautiful ! I allays offer it along with the sherry , though sister Glegg will have it I ’ m so extravagant ; and as for liking to have my clothes tidy , and not go a fright about the house , there ’ s nobody in the parish can say anything against me in respect o ’ backbiting and making mischief , for I don ’ t wish anybody any harm ; and nobody loses by sending me a porkpie , for my pies are fit to show with the best o ’ my neighbours ’ ; and the linen ’ s so in order as if I was to die to-morrow I shouldn ’ t be ashamed . A woman can do no more nor she can. ” “ But it ’ s all o ’ no use , you know , Bessy , ” said Mrs Pullet , holding her head on one side , and fixing her eyes pathetically on her sister , “ if your husband makes away with his money . Not but what if you was sold up , and other folks bought your furniture , it ’ s a comfort to think as you ’ ve kept it well rubbed . And there ’ s the linen , with your maiden mark on , might go all over the country . It ’ ud be a sad pity for our family. ” Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly . “ But what can I do , sister ? ” said Mrs Tulliver . “ Mr Tulliver ’ s not a man to be dictated to , —not if I was to go to the parson and get by heart what I should tell my husband for the best . And I ’ m sure I don ’ t pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that . I could never see into men ’ s business as sister Glegg does. ” “ Well , you ’ re like me in that , Bessy , ” said Mrs Pullet ; “ and I think it ’ ud be a deal more becoming o ’ Jane if she ’ d have that pier-glass rubbed oftener , —there was ever so many spots on it last week , —instead o ’ dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had , and telling ’ em what they ’ re to do with their money . But Jane and me were allays contrairy ; she _would_ have striped things , and I like spots . You like a spot too , Bessy ; we allays hung together i ’ that. ” “ Yes , Sophy , ” said Mrs Tulliver , “ I remember our having a blue ground with a white spot both alike , —I ’ ve got a bit in a bed-quilt now ; and if you would but go and see sister Glegg , and persuade her to make it up with Tulliver , I should take it very kind of you . You was allays a good sister to me. ” “ But the right thing ’ ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her himself , and say he was sorry for speaking so rash . If he ’ s borrowed money of her , he shouldn ’ t be above that , ” said Mrs Pullet , whose partiality did not blind her to principles ; she did not forget what was due to people of independent fortune . “ It ’ s no use talking o ’ that , ” said poor Mrs Tulliver , almost peevishly . “ If I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to Tulliver , he ’ d never humble himself. ” “ Well , you can ’ t expect me to persuade _Jane_ to beg pardon , ” said Mrs Pullet . “ Her temper ’ s beyond everything ; it ’ s well if it doesn ’ t carry her off her mind , though there never _was_ any of our family went to a madhouse. ” “ I ’ m not thinking of her begging pardon , ” said Mrs Tulliver . “ But if she ’ d just take no notice , and not call her money in ; as it ’ s not so much for one sister to ask of another ; time ’ ud mend things , and Tulliver ’ ud forget all about it , and they ’ d be friends again. ” Mrs Tulliver , you perceive , was not aware of her husband ’ s irrevocable determination to pay in the five hundred pounds ; at least such a determination exceeded her powers of belief . “ Well , Bessy , ” said Mrs Pullet , mournfully , “ _I_ don ’ t want to help you on to ruin . I won ’ t be behindhand i ’ doing you a good turn , if it is to be done . And I don ’ t like it said among acquaintance as we ’ ve got quarrels in the family . I shall tell Jane that ; and I don ’ t mind driving to Jane ’ s tomorrow , if Pullet doesn ’ t mind . What do you say , Mr Pullet ? ” “ I ’ ve no objections , ” said Mr Pullet , who was perfectly contented with any course the quarrel might take , so that Mr Tulliver did not apply to _him_ for money . Mr Pullet was nervous about his investments , and did not see how a man could have any security for his money unless he turned it into land . After a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better for Mrs Tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister Glegg , Mrs Pullet , observing that it was tea-time , turned to reach from a drawer a delicate damask napkin , which she pinned before her in the fashion of an apron . The door did , in fact , soon open , but instead of the tea-tray , Sally introduced an object so startling that both Mrs Pullet and Mrs Tulliver gave a scream , causing uncle Pullet to swallow his lozenge—for the fifth time in his life , as he afterward noted . Chapter X. Maggie Behaves Worse Than She Expected The startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was no other than little Lucy , with one side of her person , from her small foot to her bonnet-crown , wet and discoloured with mud , holding out two tiny blackened hands , and making a very piteous face . To account for this unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet ’ s parlour , we must return to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors , and the small demons who had taken possession of Maggie ’ s soul at an early period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a temporary absence . All the disagreeable recollections of the morning were thick upon her , when Tom , whose displeasure toward her had been considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his cowslip wine , said , “ Here , Lucy , you come along with me , ” and walked off to the area where the toads were , as if there were no Maggie in existence . Seeing this , Maggie lingered at a distance , looking like a small Medusa with her snakes cropped . Lucy was naturally pleased that cousin Tom was so good to her , and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area , with an iron grating over him . Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the spectacle also , especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad , and say what had been his past history ; for Lucy had a delighted semi-belief in Maggie ’ s stories about the live things they came upon by accident , —how Mrs Earwig had a wash at home , and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper , for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor . Tom had a profound contempt for this nonsense of Maggie ’ s , smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story ; but Lucy , for the life of her , could not help fancying there was something in it , and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe . So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad , added to her habitual affectionateness , made her run back to Maggie and say , “ Oh , there is such a big , funny toad , Maggie ! Do come and see ! ” Maggie said nothing , but turned away from her with a deeper frown . As long as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her , Lucy made part of his unkindness . Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could never be cross with pretty little Lucy , any more than she could be cruel to a little white mouse ; but then , Tom had always been quite indifferent to Lucy before , and it had been left to Maggie to pet and make much of her . As it was , she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her , especially as it might vex Tom , whom it was of no use to slap , even if she dared , because he didn ’ t mind it . And if Lucy hadn ’ t been there , Maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner . Tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it is possible to exhaust , and Tom by and by began to look round for some other mode of passing the time . But in so prim a garden , where they were not to go off the paved walks , there was not a great choice of sport . The only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the pleasure of breaking it , and Tom began to meditate an insurrectionary visit to the pond , about a field ’ s length beyond the garden . “ I say , Lucy , ” he began , nodding his head up and down with great significance , as he coiled up his string again , “ what do you think I mean to do ? ” “ What , Tom ? ” said Lucy , with curiosity . “ I mean to go to the pond and look at the pike . You may go with me if you like , ” said the young sultan . “ Oh , Tom , _dare_ you ? ” said Lucy . “ Aunt said we mustn ’ t go out of the garden. ” “ Oh , I shall go out at the other end of the garden , ” said Tom . “ Nobody ’ ull see us . Besides , I don ’ t care if they do , —I ’ ll run off home. ” “ But _I_ couldn ’ t run , ” said Lucy , who had never before been exposed to such severe temptation . “ Oh , never mind ; they won ’ t be cross with _you_ , ” said Tom . “ You say I took you. ” Tom walked along , and Lucy trotted by his side , timidly enjoying the rare treat of doing something naughty , —excited also by the mention of that celebrity , the pike , about which she was quite uncertain whether it was a fish or a fowl . Maggie saw them leaving the garden , and could not resist the impulse to follow . Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love , and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of which she was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to Maggie . So she kept a few yards behind them , unobserved by Tom , who was presently absorbed in watching for the pike , —a highly interesting monster ; he was said to be so very old , so very large , and to have such a remarkable appetite . The pike , like other celebrities , did not show when he was watched for , but Tom caught sight of something in rapid movement in the water , which attracted him to another spot on the brink of the pond . “ Here , Lucy ! ” he said in a loud whisper , “ come here ! take care ! keep on the grass ! —don ’ t step where the cows have been ! ” he added , pointing to a peninsula of dry grass , with trodden mud on each side of it ; for Tom ’ s contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute of being unfit to walk in dirty places . Lucy came carefully as she was bidden , and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrow-head darting through the water . It was a water-snake , Tom told her ; and Lucy at last could see the serpentine wave of its body , very much wondering that a snake could swim . Maggie had drawn nearer and nearer ; she _must_ see it too , though it was bitter to her , like everything else , since Tom did not care about her seeing it . At last she was close by Lucy ; and Tom , who had been aware of her approach , but would not notice it till he was obliged , turned round and said , — “ Now , get away , Maggie ; there ’ s no room for you on the grass here . Nobody asked _you_ to come. ” There were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a tragedy , if tragedies were made by passion only ; but the essential τι μέγεθος which was present in the passion was wanting to the action ; the utmost Maggie could do , with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm , was to push poor little pink-and-white Lucy into the cow-trodden mud . Then Tom could not restrain himself , and gave Maggie two smart slaps on the arm as he ran to pick up Lucy , who lay crying helplessly . Maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off , and looked on impenitently . Usually her repentance came quickly after one rash deed , but now Tom and Lucy had made her so miserable , she was glad to spoil their happiness , —glad to make everybody uncomfortable . Why should she be sorry ? Tom was very slow to forgive _her_ , however sorry she might have been . “ I shall tell mother , you know , Miss Mag , ” said Tom , loudly and emphatically , as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away . It was not Tom ’ s practice to “ tell , ” but here justice clearly demanded that Maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment ; not that Tom had learned to put his views in that abstract form ; he never mentioned “ justice , ” and had no idea that his desire to punish might be called by that fine name . Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had befallen her , —the spoiling of her pretty best clothes , and the discomfort of being wet and dirty , —to think much of the cause , which was entirely mysterious to her . She could never have guessed what she had done to make Maggie angry with her ; but she felt that Maggie was very unkind and disagreeable , and made no magnanimous entreaties to Tom that he would not “ tell , ” only running along by his side and crying piteously , while Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with her small Medusa face . “ Sally , ” said Tom , when they reached the kitchen door , and Sally looked at them in speechless amaze , with a piece of bread-and-butter in her mouth and a toasting-fork in her hand , — “ Sally , tell mother it was Maggie pushed Lucy into the mud. ” “ But Lors ha ’ massy , how did you get near such mud as that ? ” said Sally , making a wry face , as she stooped down and examined the _corpus delicti_ . Tom ’ s imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include this question among the foreseen consequences , but it was no sooner put than he foresaw whither it tended , and that Maggie would not be considered the only culprit in the case . He walked quietly away from the kitchen door , leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which active minds notoriously prefer to ready-made knowledge . Sally , as you are aware , lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlour door , for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum Firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind . “ Goodness gracious ! ” aunt Pullet exclaimed , after preluding by an inarticulate scream ; “ keep her at the door , Sally ! Don ’ t bring her off the oil-cloth , whatever you do. ” “ Why , she ’ s tumbled into some nasty mud , ” said Mrs Tulliver , going up to Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she felt herself responsible to her sister Deane . “ If you please , ’ um , it was Miss Maggie as pushed her in , ” said Sally ; “ Master Tom ’ s been and said so , and they must ha ’ been to the pond , for it ’ s only there they could ha ’ got into such dirt. ” “ There it is , Bessy ; it ’ s what I ’ ve been telling you , ” said Mrs Pullet , in a tone of prophetic sadness ; “ it ’ s your children , —there ’ s no knowing what they ’ ll come to. ” Mrs Tulliver was mute , feeling herself a truly wretched mother . As usual , the thought pressed upon her that people would think she had done something wicked to deserve her maternal troubles , while Mrs Pullet began to give elaborate directions to Sally how to guard the premises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt . Meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook , and the two naughty children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen . Mrs Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children , supposing them to be close at hand ; but it was not until after some search that she found Tom leaning with rather a hardened , careless air against the white paling of the poultry-yard , and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means of exasperating the turkey-cock . “ Tom , you naughty boy , where ’ s your sister ? ” said Mrs Tulliver , in a distressed voice . “ I don ’ t know , ” said Tom ; his eagerness for justice on Maggie had diminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought about without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct . “ Why , where did you leave her ? ” said the mother , looking round . “ Sitting under the tree , against the pond , ” said Tom , apparently indifferent to everything but the string and the turkey-cock . “ Then go and fetch her in this minute , you naughty boy . And how could you think o ’ going to the pond , and taking your sister where there was dirt ? You know she ’ ll do mischief if there ’ s mischief to be done. ” It was Mrs Tulliver ’ s way , if she blamed Tom , to refer his misdemeanour , somehow or other , to Maggie . The idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in Mrs Tulliver ’ s mind , and she mounted the horse-block to satisfy herself by a sight of that fatal child , while Tom walked—not very quickly—on his way toward her . “ They ’ re such children for the water , mine are , ” she said aloud , without reflecting that there was no one to hear her ; “ they ’ ll be brought in dead and drownded some day . I wish that river was far enough. ” But when she not only failed to discern Maggie , but presently saw Tom returning from the pool alone , this hovering fear entered and took complete possession of her , and she hurried to meet him . “ Maggie ’ s nowhere about the pond , mother , ” said Tom ; “ she ’ s gone away. ” You may conceive the terrified search for Maggie , and the difficulty of convincing her mother that she was not in the pond . Mrs Pullet observed that the child might come to a worse end if she lived , there was no knowing ; and Mr Pullet , confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary aspect of things , —the tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the unusual running to and fro , —took up his spud as an instrument of search , and reached down a key to unlock the goose-pen , as a likely place for Maggie to lie concealed in . Tom , after a while , started the idea that Maggie was gone home ( without thinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done himself under the circumstances ) , and the suggestion was seized as a comfort by his mother . “ Sister , for goodness ’ sake let ’ em put the horse in the carriage and take me home ; we shall perhaps find her on the road . Lucy can ’ t walk in her dirty clothes , ” she said , looking at that innocent victim , who was wrapped up in a shawl , and sitting with naked feet on the sofa . Aunt Pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring her premises to order and quiet , and it was not long before Mrs Tulliver was in the chaise , looking anxiously at the most distant point before her . What the father would say if Maggie was lost , was a question that predominated over every other . Chapter XI . Maggie Tries to Run away from Her Shadow Maggie ’ s intentions , as usual , were on a larger scale than Tom imagined . The resolution that gathered in her mind , after Tom and Lucy had walked away , was not so simple as that of going home . No ! she would run away and go to the gypsies , and Tom should never see her any more . That was by no means a new idea to Maggie ; she had been so often told she was like a gypsy , and “ half wild , ” that when she was miserable it seemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium , and being entirely in harmony with circumstances , would be to live in a little brown tent on the commons ; the gypsies , she considered , would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge . She had once mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested that he should stain his face brown , and they should run away together ; but Tom rejected the scheme with contempt , observing that gypsies were thieves , and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey . To-day however , Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was her refuge , and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life ; she would run straight away till she came to Dunlow Common , where there would certainly be gypsies ; and cruel Tom , and the rest of her relations who found fault with her , should never see her any more . She thought of her father as she ran along , but she reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him , by determining that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gypsy , who would run away without telling where she was , and just let him know that she was well and happy , and always loved him very much . Maggie soon got out of breath with running , but by the time Tom got to the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields , and was on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad . She stopped to pant a little , reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until one had got quite to the common where the gypsies were , but her resolution had not abated ; she presently passed through the gate into the lane , not knowing where it would lead her , for it was not this way that they came from Dorlcote Mill to Garum Firs , and she felt all the safer for that , because there was no chance of her being overtaken . But she was soon aware , not without trembling , that there were two men coming along the lane in front of her ; she had not thought of meeting strangers , she had been too much occupied with the idea of her friends coming after her . The formidable strangers were two shabby-looking men with flushed faces , one of them carrying a bundle on a stick over his shoulder ; but to her surprise , while she was dreading their disapprobation as a runaway , the man with the bundle stopped , and in a half-whining , half-coaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give a poor man . Maggie had a sixpence in her pocket , —her uncle Glegg ’ s present , —which she immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a polite smile , hoping he would feel very kindly toward her as a generous person . “ That ’ s the only money I ’ ve got , ” she said apologetically . “ Thank you , little miss , ” said the man , in a less respectful and grateful tone than Maggie anticipated , and she even observed that he smiled and winked at his companion . She walked on hurriedly , but was aware that the two men were standing still , probably to look after her , and she presently heard them laughing loudly . Suddenly it occurred to her that they might think she was an idiot ; Tom had said that her cropped hair made her look like an idiot , and it was too painful an idea to be readily forgotten . Besides , she had no sleeves on , —only a cape and bonnet . It was clear that she was not likely to make a favourable impression on passengers , and she thought she would turn into the fields again , but not on the same side of the lane as before , lest they should still be uncle Pullet ’ s fields . She turned through the first gate that was not locked , and felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the hedgerows , after her recent humiliating encounter . She was used to wandering about the fields by herself , and was less timid there than on the highroad . Sometimes she had to climb over high gates , but that was a small evil ; she was getting out of reach very fast , and she should probably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common , or at least of some other common , for she had heard her father say that you couldn ’ t go very far without coming to a common . She hoped so , for she was getting rather tired and hungry , and until she reached the gypsies there was no definite prospect of bread and butter . It was still broad daylight , for aunt Pullet , retaining the early habits of the Dodson family , took tea at half-past four by the sun , and at five by the kitchen clock ; so , though it was nearly an hour since Maggie started , there was no gathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the night would come . Still , it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance indeed , and it was really surprising that the common did not come within sight . Hitherto she had been in the rich parish of Garum , where was a great deal of pasture-land , and she had only seen one labourer at a distance . That was fortunate in some respects , as labourers might be too ignorant to understand the propriety of her wanting to go to Dunlow Common ; yet it would have been better if she could have met some one who would tell her the way without wanting to know anything about her private business . At last , however , the green fields came to an end , and Maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it . She had never seen such a wide lane before , and , without her knowing why , it gave her the impression that the common could not be far off ; perhaps it was because she saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin , for she had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow Common when she had been across it in her father ’ s gig . She crept through the bars of the gate and walked on with new spirit , though not without haunting images of Apollyon , and a highwayman with a pistol , and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth from ear to ear , and other miscellaneous dangers . For poor little Maggie had at once the timidity of an active imagination and the daring that comes from overmastering impulse . She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown kindred , the gypsies ; and now she was in this strange lane , she hardly dared look on one side of her , lest she should see the diabolical blacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo . It was not without a leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small pair of bare legs sticking up , feet uppermost , by the side of a hillock ; they seemed something hideously preternatural , —a diabolical kind of fungus ; for she was too much agitated at the first glance to see the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy head attached to them . It was a boy asleep , and Maggie trotted along faster and more lightly , lest she should wake him ; it did not occur to her that he was one of her friends the gypsies , who in all probability would have very genial manners . But the fact was so , for at the next bend in the lane Maggie actually saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke rising before it , which was to be her refuge from all the blighting obloquy that had pursued her in civilised life . She even saw a tall female figure by the column of smoke , doubtless the gypsy-mother , who provided the tea and other groceries ; it was astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted . But it was startling to find the gypsies in a lane , after all , and not on a common ; indeed , it was rather disappointing ; for a mysterious illimitable common , where there were sand-pits to hide in , and one was out of everybody ’ s reach , had always made part of Maggie ’ s picture of gypsy life . She went on , however , and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew nothing about idiots , so there was no danger of their falling into the mistake of setting her down at the first glance as an idiot . It was plain she had attracted attention ; for the tall figure , who proved to be a young woman with a baby on her arm , walked slowly to meet her . Maggie looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it approached , and was reassured by the thought that her aunt Pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gypsy ; for this face , with the bright dark eyes and the long hair , was really something like what she used to see in the glass before she cut her hair off . “ My little lady , where are you going to ? ” the gypsy said , in a tone of coaxing deference . It was delightful , and just what Maggie expected ; the gypsies saw at once that she was a little lady , and were prepared to treat her accordingly . “ Not any farther , ” said Maggie , feeling as if she were saying what she had rehearsed in a dream . “ I ’ m come to stay with _you_ , please. ” “ That ’ s pretty ; come , then . Why , what a nice little lady you are , to be sure ! ” said the gypsy , taking her by the hand . Maggie thought her very agreeable , but wished she had not been so dirty . There was quite a group round the fire when she reached it . An old gypsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her knees , and occasionally poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an odorous steam ; two small shock-headed children were lying prone and resting on their elbows something like small sphinxes ; and a placid donkey was bending his head over a tall girl , who , lying on her back , was scratching his nose and indulging him with a bite of excellent stolen hay . The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them , and the scene was really very pretty and comfortable , Maggie thought , only she hoped they would soon set out the tea-cups . Everything would be quite charming when she had taught the gypsies to use a washing-basin , and to feel an interest in books . It was a little confusing , though , that the young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which Maggie did not understand , while the tall girl , who was feeding the donkey , sat up and stared at her without offering any salutation . At last the old woman said , — “ What ! my pretty lady , are you come to stay with us ? Sit ye down and tell us where you come from. ” It was just like a story ; Maggie liked to be called pretty lady and treated in this way . She sat down and said , — “ I ’ m come from home because I ’ m unhappy , and I mean to be a gypsy . I ’ ll live with you if you like , and I can teach you a great many things. ” “ Such a clever little lady , ” said the woman with the baby sitting down by Maggie , and allowing baby to crawl ; “ and such a pretty bonnet and frock , ” she added , taking off Maggie ’ s bonnet and looking at it while she made an observation to the old woman , in the unknown language . The tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hind-foremost with a grin ; but Maggie was determined not to show any weakness on this subject , as if she were susceptible about her bonnet . “ I don ’ t want to wear a bonnet , ” she said ; “ I ’ d rather wear a red handkerchief , like yours ” ( looking at her friend by her side ) . “ My hair was quite long till yesterday , when I cut it off ; but I dare say it will grow again very soon , ” she added apologetically , thinking it probable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favour of long hair . And Maggie had forgotten even her hunger at that moment in the desire to conciliate gypsy opinion . “ Oh , what a nice little lady ! —and rich , I ’ m sure , ” said the old woman . “ Didn ’ t you live in a beautiful house at home ? ” “ Yes , my home is pretty , and I ’ m very fond of the river , where we go fishing , but I ’ m often very unhappy . I should have liked to bring my books with me , but I came away in a hurry , you know . But I can tell you almost everything there is in my books , I ’ ve read them so many times , and that will amuse you . And I can tell you something about Geography too , —that ’ s about the world we live in , —very useful and interesting . Did you ever hear about Columbus ? ” Maggie ’ s eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flush , —she was really beginning to instruct the gypsies , and gaining great influence over them . The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this talk , though their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie ’ s pocket , which the friend at her right hand had by this time emptied without attracting her notice . “ Is that where you live , my little lady ? ” said the old woman , at the mention of Columbus . “ Oh , no ! ” said Maggie , with some pity ; “ Columbus was a very wonderful man , who found out half the world , and they put chains on him and treated him very badly , you know ; it ’ s in my Catechism of Geography , but perhaps it ’ s rather too long to tell before tea—_I want my tea so_. ” The last words burst from Maggie , in spite of herself , with a sudden drop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness . “ Why , she ’ s hungry , poor little lady , ” said the younger woman . “ Give her some o ’ the cold victual . You ’ ve been walking a good way , I ’ ll be bound , my dear . Where ’ s your home ? ” “ It ’ s Dorlcote Mill , a good way off , ” said Maggie . “ My father is Mr Tulliver , but we mustn ’ t let him know where I am , else he ’ ll fetch me home again . Where does the queen of the gypsies live ? ” “ What ! do you want to go to her , my little lady ? ” said the younger woman . The tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at Maggie and grinning . Her manners were certainly not agreeable . “ No , ” said Maggie , “ I ’ m only thinking that if she isn ’ t a very good queen you might be glad when she died , and you could choose another . If I was a queen , I ’ d be a very good queen , and kind to everybody. ” “ Here ’ s a bit o ’ nice victual , then , ” said the old woman , handing to Maggie a lump of dry bread , which she had taken from a bag of scraps , and a piece of cold bacon . “ Thank you , ’ said Maggie , looking at the food without taking it ; “ but will you give me some bread-and-butter and tea instead ? I don ’ t like bacon. ” “ We ’ ve got no tea nor butter , ” said the old woman , with something like a scowl , as if she were getting tired of coaxing . “ Oh , a little bread and treacle would do , ” said Maggie . “ We han ’ t got no treacle , ” said the old woman , crossly , whereupon there followed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their unknown tongue , and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the bread-and-bacon , and began to eat it . At this moment the tall girl , who had gone a few yards off , came back , and said something which produced a strong effect . The old woman , seeming to forget Maggie ’ s hunger , poked the skewer into the pot with new vigor , and the younger crept under the tent and reached out some platters and spoons . Maggie trembled a little , and was afraid the tears would come into her eyes . Meanwhile the tall girl gave a shrill cry , and presently came running up the boy whom Maggie had passed as he was sleeping , —a rough urchin about the age of Tom . He stared at Maggie , and there ensued much incomprehensible chattering . She felt very lonely , and was quite sure she should begin to cry before long ; the gypsies didn ’ t seem to mind her at all , and she felt quite weak among them . But the springing tears were checked by new terror , when two men came up , whose approach had been the cause of the sudden excitement . The elder of the two carried a bag , which he flung down , addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone , which they answered by a shower of treble sauciness ; while a black cur ran barking up to Maggie , and threw her into a tremor that only found a new cause in the curses with which the younger man called the dog off , and gave him a rap with a great stick he held in his hand . Maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these people , or ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge . Both the men now seemed to be inquiring about Maggie , for they looked at her , and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind which implies curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on the other . At last the younger woman said in her previous deferential , coaxing tone , — “ This nice little lady ’ s come to live with us ; aren ’ t you glad ? ” “ Ay , very glad , ” said the younger man , who was looking at Maggie ’ s silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her pocket . He returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman , with some observation , and she immediately restored them to Maggie ’ s pocket , while the men seated themselves , and began to attack the contents of the kettle , —a stew of meat and potatoes , —which had been taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter . Maggie began to think that Tom must be right about the gypsies ; they must certainly be thieves , unless the man meant to return her thimble by and by . She would willingly have given it to him , for she was not at all attached to her thimble ; but the idea that she was among thieves prevented her from feeling any comfort in the revival of deference and attention toward her ; all thieves , except Robin Hood , were wicked people . The women saw she was frightened . “ We ’ ve got nothing nice for a lady to eat , ” said the old woman , in her coaxing tone . “ And she ’ s so hungry , sweet little lady. ” “ Here , my dear , try if you can eat a bit o ’ this , ” said the younger woman , handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to Maggie , who , remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her for not liking the bread-and-bacon , dared not refuse the stew , though fear had chased away her appetite . If her father would but come by in the gig and take her up ! But Maggie thought with a sinking heart that these heroes were never seen in the neighbourhood of St Ogg ’ s ; nothing very wonderful ever came there . Maggie Tulliver , you perceive , was by no means that well trained , well-informed young person that a small female of eight or nine necessarily is in these days ; she had only been to school a year at St Ogg ’ s , and had so few books that she sometimes read the dictionary ; so that in travelling over her small mind you would have found the most unexpected ignorance as well as unexpected knowledge . She could have informed you that there was such a word as “ polygamy , ” and being also acquainted with “ polysyllable , ” she had deduced the conclusion that “ poly ” mean “ many ” ; but she had had no idea that gypsies were not well supplied with groceries , and her thoughts generally were the oddest mixture of clear-eyed acumen and blind dreams . Her ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the last five minutes . From having considered them very respectful companions , amenable to instruction , she had begun to think that they meant perhaps to kill her as soon as it was dark , and cut up her body for gradual cooking ; the suspicion crossed her that the fierce-eyed old man was in fact the Devil , who might drop that transparent disguise at any moment , and turn either into the grinning blacksmith , or else a fiery-eyed monster with dragon ’ s wings . It was no use trying to eat the stew , and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend the gypsies , by betraying her extremely unfavourable opinion of them ; and she wondered , with a keenness of interest that no theologian could have exceeded , whether , if the Devil were really present , he would know her thoughts . “ What ! you don ’ t like the smell of it , my dear , ” said the young woman , observing that Maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew . “ Try a bit , come. ” “ No , thank you , ” said Maggie , summoning all her force for a desperate effort , and trying to smile in a friendly way . “ I haven ’ t time , I think ; it seems getting darker . I think I must go home now , and come again another day , and then I can bring you a basket with some jam-tarts and things. ” Maggie rose from her seat as she threw out this illusory prospect , devoutly hoping that Apollyon was gullible ; but her hope sank when the old gypsy-woman said , “ Stop a bit , stop a bit , little lady ; we ’ ll take you home , all safe , when we ’ ve done supper ; you shall ride home , like a lady. ” Maggie sat down again , with little faith in this promise , though she presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey , and throwing a couple of bags on his back . “ Now , then , little missis , ” said the younger man , rising , and leading the donkey forward , “ tell us where you live ; what ’ s the name o ’ the place ? ” “ Dorlcote Mill is my home , ” said Maggie , eagerly . “ My father is Mr Tulliver ; he lives there. ” “ What ! a big mill a little way this side o ’ St Ogg ’ s ? ” “ Yes , ” said Maggie . “ Is it far off ? I think I should like to walk there , if you please. ” “ No , no , it ’ ll be getting dark , we must make haste . And the donkey ’ ll carry you as nice as can be ; you ’ ll see. ” He lifted Maggie as he spoke , and set her on the donkey . She felt relieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her , but she had only a trembling hope that she was really going home . “ Here ’ s your pretty bonnet , ” said the younger woman , putting that recently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie ’ s head ; “ and you ’ ll say we ’ ve been very good to you , won ’ t you ? and what a nice little lady we said you was. ” “ Oh yes , thank you , ” said Maggie , “ I ’ m very much obliged to you . But I wish you ’ d go with me too. ” She thought anything was better than going with one of the dreadful men alone ; it would be more cheerful to be murdered by a larger party . “ Ah , you ’ re fondest o ’ _me_ , aren ’ t you ? ” said the woman . “ But I can ’ t go ; you ’ ll go too fast for me. ” It now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey , holding Maggie before him , and she was as incapable of remonstrating against this arrangement as the donkey himself , though no nightmare had ever seemed to her more horrible . When the woman had patted her on the back , and said “ Good-by , ” the donkey , at a strong hint from the man ’ s stick , set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point Maggie had come from an hour ago , while the tall girl and the rough urchin , also furnished with sticks , obligingly escorted them for the first hundred yards , with much screaming and thwacking . Not Leonore , in that preternatural midnight excursion with her phantom lover , was more terrified than poor Maggie in this entirely natural ride on a short-paced donkey , with a gypsy behind her , who considered that he was earning half a crown . The red light of the setting sun seemed to have a portentous meaning , with which the alarming bray of the second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have some connection . Two low thatched cottages—the only houses they passed in this lane—seemed to add to its dreariness ; they had no windows to speak of , and the doors were closed ; it was probable that they were inhabitated by witches , and it was a relief to find that the donkey did not stop there . At last—oh , sight of joy ! —this lane , the longest in the world , was coming to an end , was opening on a broad highroad , where there was actually a coach passing ! And there was a finger-post at the corner , —she had surely seen that finger-post before , — “ To St Ogg ’ s , 2 miles. ” The gypsy really meant to take her home , then ; he was probably a good man , after all , and might have been rather hurt at the thought that she didn ’ t like coming with him alone . This idea became stronger as she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well , and she was considering how she might open a conversation with the injured gypsy , and not only gratify his feelings but efface the impression of her cowardice , when , as they reached a cross-road . Maggie caught sight of some one coming on a white-faced horse . “ Oh , stop , stop ! ” she cried out . “ There ’ s my father ! Oh , father , father ! ” The sudden joy was almost painful , and before her father reached her , she was sobbing . Great was Mr Tulliver ’ s wonder , for he had made a round from Basset , and had not yet been home . “ Why , what ’ s the meaning o ’ this ? ” he said , checking his horse , while Maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her father ’ s stirrup . “ The little miss lost herself , I reckon , ” said the gypsy . “ She ’ d come to our tent at the far end o ’ Dunlow Lane , and I was bringing her where she said her home was . It ’ s a good way to come after being on the tramp all day. ” “ Oh yes , father , he ’ s been very good to bring me home , ” said Maggie , — “ a very kind , good man ! ” “ Here , then , my man , ” said Mr Tulliver , taking out five shillings . “ It ’ s the best day ’ s work _you_ ever did . I couldn ’ t afford to lose the little wench ; here , lift her up before me. ” “ Why , Maggie , how ’ s this , how ’ s this ? ” he said , as they rode along , while she laid her head against her father and sobbed . “ How came you to be rambling about and lose yourself ? ” “ Oh , father , ” sobbed Maggie , “ I ran away because I was so unhappy ; Tom was so angry with me . I couldn ’ t bear it. ” “ Pooh , pooh , ” said Mr Tulliver , soothingly , “ you mustn ’ t think o ’ running away from father . What ’ ud father do without his little wench ? ” “ Oh no , I never will again , father—never. ” Mr Tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that evening ; and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that Maggie never heard one reproach from her mother , or one taunt from Tom , about this foolish business of her running away to the gypsies . Maggie was rather awe-stricken by this unusual treatment , and sometimes thought that her conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to . Chapter XII . Mr and Mrs Glegg at Home In order to see Mr and Mrs Glegg at home , we must enter the town of St Ogg ’ s , —that venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the broad warehouse gables , where the black ships unlade themselves of their burthens from the far north , and carry away , in exchange , the precious inland products , the well-crushed cheese and the soft fleeces which my refined readers have doubtless become acquainted with through the medium of the best classic pastorals . It is one of those old , old towns which impress one as a continuation and outgrowth of nature , as much as the nests of the bower-birds or the winding galleries of the white ants ; a town which carries the traces of its long growth and history like a millennial tree , and has sprung up and developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from the time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp on the hillside , and the long-haired sea-kings came up the river and looked with fierce , eager eyes at the fatness of the land . It is a town “ familiar with forgotten years. ” The shadow of the Saxon hero-king still walks there fitfully , reviewing the scenes of his youth and love-time , and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful heathen Dane , who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an invisible avenger , and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist from his tumulus on the hill , and hovers in the court of the old hall by the river-side , the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the days before the old hall was built . It was the Normans who began to build that fine old hall , which is , like the town , telling of the thoughts and hands of widely sundered generations ; but it is all so old that we look with loving pardon at its inconsistencies , and are well content that they who built the stone oriel , and they who built the Gothic façade and towers of finest small brickwork with the trefoil ornament , and the windows and battlements defined with stone , did not sacreligiously pull down the ancient half-timbered body with its oak-roofed banqueting-hall . But older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built into the belfry of the parish church , and said to be a remnant of the original chapel dedicated to St Ogg , the patron saint of this ancient town , of whose history I possess several manuscript versions . I incline to the briefest , since , if it should not be wholly true , it is at least likely to contain the least falsehood . “ Ogg the son of Beorl , ” says my private hagiographer , “ was a boatman who gained a scanty living by ferrying passengers across the river Floss . And it came to pass , one evening when the winds were high , that there sat moaning by the brink of the river a woman with a child in her arms ; and she was clad in rags , and had a worn and withered look , and she craved to be rowed across the river . And the men thereabout questioned her , and said , ‘ Wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river ? Tarry till the morning , and take shelter here for the night ; so shalt thou be wise and not foolish. ’ Still she went on to mourn and crave . But Ogg the son of Beorl came up and said , ‘ I will ferry thee across ; it is enough that thy heart needs it. ’ And he ferried her across . And it came to pass , when she stepped ashore , that her rags were turned into robes of flowing white , and her face became bright with exceeding beauty , and there was a glory around it , so that she shed a light on the water like the moon in its brightness . And she said , ‘ Ogg , the son of Beorl , thou art blessed in that thou didst not question and wrangle with the heart ’ s need , but wast smitten with pity , and didst straightway relieve the same . And from henceforth whoso steps into thy boat shall be in no peril from the storm ; and whenever it puts forth to the rescue , it shall save the lives both of men and beasts. ’ And when the floods came , many were saved by reason of that blessing on the boat . But when Ogg the son of Beorl died , behold , in the parting of his soul , the boat loosed itself from its moorings , and was floated with the ebbing tide in great swiftness to the ocean , and was seen no more . Yet it was witnessed in the floods of aftertime , that at the coming on of eventide , Ogg the son of Beorl was always seen with his boat upon the wide-spreading waters , and the Blessed Virgin sat in the prow , shedding a light around as of the moon in its brightness , so that the rowers in the gathering darkness took heart and pulled anew. ” This legend , one sees , reflects from a far-off time the visitation of the floods , which , even when they left human life untouched , were widely fatal to the helpless cattle , and swept as sudden death over all smaller living things . But the town knew worse troubles even than the floods , —troubles of the civil wars , when it was a continual fighting-place , where first Puritans thanked God for the blood of the Loyalists , and then Loyalists thanked God for the blood of the Puritans . Many honest citizens lost all their possessions for conscience ’ sake in those times , and went forth beggared from their native town . Doubtless there are many houses standing now on which those honest citizens turned their backs in sorrow , —quaint-gabled houses looking on the river , jammed between newer warehouses , and penetrated by surprising passages , which turn and turn at sharp angles till they lead you out on a muddy strand overflowed continually by the rushing tide . Everywhere the brick houses have a mellow look , and in Mrs Glegg ’ s day there was no incongruous new-fashioned smartness , no plate-glass in shop-windows , no fresh stucco-facing or other fallacious attempt to make fine old red St Ogg ’ s wear the air of a town that sprang up yesterday . The shop-windows were small and unpretending ; for the farmers ’ wives and daughters who came to do their shopping on market-days were not to be withdrawn from their regular well-known shops ; and the tradesmen had no wares intended for customers who would go on their way and be seen no more . Ah ! even Mrs Glegg ’ s day seems far back in the past now , separated from us by changes that widen the years . War and the rumor of war had then died out from the minds of men , and if they were ever thought of by the farmers in drab greatcoats , who shook the grain out of their sample-bags and buzzed over it in the full market-place , it was as a state of things that belonged to a past golden age when prices were high . Surely the time was gone forever when the broad river could bring up unwelcome ships ; Russia was only the place where the linseed came from , —the more the better , —making grist for the great vertical millstones with their scythe-like arms , roaring and grinding and carefully sweeping as if an informing soul were in them . The Catholics , bad harvests , and the mysterious fluctuations of trade were the three evils mankind had to fear ; even the floods had not been great of late years . The mind of St Ogg ’ s did not look extensively before or after . It inherited a long past without thinking of it , and had no eyes for the spirits that walk the streets . Since the centuries when St Ogg with his boat and the Virgin Mother at the prow had been seen on the wide water , so many memories had been left behind , and had gradually vanished like the receding hilltops ! And the present time was like the level plain where men lose their belief in volcanoes and earthquakes , thinking to-morrow will be as yesterday , and the giant forces that used to shake the earth are forever laid to sleep . The days were gone when people could be greatly wrought upon by their faith , still less change it ; the Catholics were formidable because they would lay hold of government and property , and burn men alive ; not because any sane and honest parishioner of St Ogg ’ s could be brought to believe in the Pope . One aged person remembered how a rude multitude had been swayed when John Wesley preached in the cattle-market ; but for a long while it had not been expected of preachers that they should shake the souls of men . An occasional burst of fervor in Dissenting pulpits on the subject of infant baptism was the only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times when men had done with change . Protestantism sat at ease , unmindful of schisms , careless of proselytism : Dissent was an inheritance along with a superior pew and a business connection ; and Churchmanship only wondered contemptuously at Dissent as a foolish habit that clung greatly to families in the grocery and chandlering lines , though not incompatible with prosperous wholesale dealing . But with the Catholic Question had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm : the elderly rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative ; and Mr Spray , the Independent minister , had begun to preach political sermons , in which he distinguished with much subtlety between his fervent belief in the right of the Catholics to the franchise and his fervent belief in their eternal perdition . Most of Mr Spray ’ s hearers , however , were incapable of following his subtleties , and many old-fashioned Dissenters were much pained by his “ siding with the Catholics ” ; while others thought he had better let politics alone . Public spirit was not held in high esteem at St Ogg ’ s , and men who busied themselves with political questions were regarded with some suspicion , as dangerous characters ; they were usually persons who had little or no business of their own to manage , or , if they had , were likely enough to become insolvent . This was the general aspect of things at St Ogg ’ s in Mrs Glegg ’ s day , and at that particular period in her family history when she had had her quarrel with Mr Tulliver . It was a time when ignorance was much more comfortable than at present , and was received with all the honours in very good society , without being obliged to dress itself in an elaborate costume of knowledge ; a time when cheap periodicals were not , and when country surgeons never thought of asking their female patients if they were fond of reading , but simply took it for granted that they preferred gossip ; a time when ladies in rich silk gowns wore large pockets , in which they carried a mutton-bone to secure them against cramp . Mrs Glegg carried such a bone , which she had inherited from her grandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty , like a suit of armor , and a silver-headed walking-stick ; for the Dodson family had been respectable for many generations . Mrs Glegg had both a front and a back parlour in her excellent house at St Ogg ’ s , so that she had two points of view from which she could observe the weakness of her fellow-beings , and reinforce her thankfulness for her own exceptional strength of mind . From her front window she could look down the Tofton Road , leading out of St Ogg ’ s , and note the growing tendency to “ gadding about ” in the wives of men not retired from business , together with a practice of wearing woven cotton stockings , which opened a dreary prospect for the coming generation ; and from her back windows she could look down the pleasant garden and orchard which stretched to the river , and observe the folly of Mr Glegg in spending his time among “ them flowers and vegetables. ” For Mr Glegg , having retired from active business as a wool-stapler for the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life , had found this last occupation so much more severe than his business , that he had been driven into amateur hard labour as a dissipation , and habitually relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners . The economizing of a gardener ’ s wages might perhaps have induced Mrs Glegg to wink at this folly , if it were possible for a healthy female mind even to simulate respect for a husband ’ s hobby . But it is well known that this conjugal complacency belongs only to the weaker portion of the sex , who are scarcely alive to the responsibilities of a wife as a constituted check on her husband ’ s pleasures , which are hardly ever of a rational or commendable kind . Mr Glegg on his side , too , had a double source of mental occupation , which gave every promise of being inexhaustible . On the one hand , he surprised himself by his discoveries in natural history , finding that his piece of garden-ground contained wonderful caterpillars , slugs , and insects , which , so far as he had heard , had never before attracted human observation ; and he noticed remarkable coincidences between these zoological phenomena and the great events of that time , —as , for example , that before the burning of York Minster there had been mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rose-trees , together with an unusual prevalence of slugs , which he had been puzzled to know the meaning of , until it flashed upon him with this melancholy conflagration . ( Mr Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity , which , when disengaged from the wool business , naturally made itself a pathway in other directions . ) And his second subject of meditation was the “ contrairiness ” of the female mind , as typically exhibited in Mrs Glegg . That a creature made—in a genealogical sense—out of a man ’ s rib , and in this particular case maintained in the highest respectability without any trouble of her own , should be normally in a state of contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most accommodating concessions , was a mystery in the scheme of things to which he had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of Genesis . Mr Glegg had chosen the eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome embodiment of female prudence and thrift , and being himself of a money-getting , money-keeping turn , had calculated on much conjugal harmony . But in that curious compound , the feminine character , it may easily happen that the flavour is unpleasant in spite of excellent ingredients ; and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a seasoning that quite spoils its relish . Now , good Mr Glegg himself was stingy in the most amiable manner ; his neighbours called him “ near , ” which always means that the person in question is a lovable skinflint . If you expressed a preference for cheese-parings , Mr Glegg would remember to save them for you , with a good-natured delight in gratifying your palate , and he was given to pet all animals which required no appreciable keep . There was no humbug or hypocrisy about Mr Glegg ; his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of a widow ’ s furniture , which a five-pound note from his side pocket would have prevented ; but a donation of five pounds to a person “ in a small way of life ” would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather than “ charity , ” which had always presented itself to him as a contribution of small aids , not a neutralizing of misfortune . And Mr Glegg was just as fond of saving other people ’ s money as his own ; he would have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses were to be paid for him , as when they were to come out of his own pocket , and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking . This inalienable habit of saving , as an end in itself , belonged to the industrious men of business of a former generation , who made their fortunes slowly , almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the harrier , —it constituted them a “ race , ” which is nearly lost in these days of rapid money-getting , when lavishness comes close on the back of want . In old-fashioned times an “ independence ” was hardly ever made without a little miserliness as a condition , and you would have found that quality in every provincial district , combined with characters as various as the fruits from which we can extract acid . The true Harpagons were always marked and exceptional characters ; not so the worthy tax-payers , who , having once pinched from real necessity , retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement , with their wallfruit and wine-bins , the habit of regarding life as an ingenious process of nibbling out one ’ s livelihood without leaving any perceptible deficit , and who would have been as immediately prompted to give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred a year , as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital . Mr Glegg was one of these men , found so impracticable by chancellors of the exchequer ; and knowing this , you will be the better able to understand why he had not swerved from the conviction BOY AND GIRL .

Outside Dorlcote Mill A wide plain , where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green banks to the sea , and the loving tide , rushing to meet it , checks its passage with an impetuous embrace . On this mighty tide the black ships—laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks , with rounded sacks of oil-bearing seed , or with the dark glitter of coal—are borne along to the town of St Ogg ’ s , which shows its aged , fluted red roofs and the broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the river-brink , tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the transient glance of this February sun . Far away on each hand stretch the rich pastures , and the patches of dark earth made ready for the seed of broad-leaved green crops , or touched already with the tint of the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn . There is a remnant still of last year ’ s golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the hedgerows ; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees ; the distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their red-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash . Just by the red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current into the Floss . How lovely the little river is , with its dark changing wavelets ! It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along the bank , and listen to its low , placid voice , as to the voice of one who is deaf and loving . I remember those large dipping willows . I remember the stone bridge . And this is Dorlcote Mill . I must stand a minute or two here on the bridge and look at it , though the clouds are threatening , and it is far on in the afternoon . Even in this leafless time of departing February it is pleasant to look at , —perhaps the chill , damp season adds a charm to the trimly kept , comfortable dwelling-house , as old as the elms and chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast . The stream is brimful now , and lies high in this little withy plantation , and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house . As I look at the full stream , the vivid grass , the delicate bright-green powder softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from under the bare purple boughs , I am in love with moistness , and envy the white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among the withes , unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier world above . The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy deafness , which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene . They are like a great curtain of sound , shutting one out from the world beyond . And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming home with sacks of grain . That honest wagoner is thinking of his dinner , getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour ; but he will not touch it till he has fed his horses , —the strong , submissive , meek-eyed beasts , who , I fancy , are looking mild reproach at him from between their blinkers , that he should crack his whip at them in that awful manner as if they needed that hint ! See how they stretch their shoulders up the slope toward the bridge , with all the more energy because they are so near home . Look at their grand shaggy feet that seem to grasp the firm earth , at the patient strength of their necks , bowed under the heavy collar , at the mighty muscles of their struggling haunches ! I should like well to hear them neigh over their hardly-earned feed of corn , and see them , with their moist necks freed from the harness , dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond . Now they are on the bridge , and down they go again at a swifter pace , and the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the trees . Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again , and watch the unresting wheel sending out its diamond jets of water . That little girl is watching it too ; she has been standing on just the same spot at the edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge . And that queer white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel ; perhaps he is jealous because his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement . It is time the little playfellow went in , I think ; and there is a very bright fire to tempt her : the red light shines out under the deepening gray of the sky . It is time , too , for me to leave off resting my arms on the cold stone of this bridge .... Ah , my arms are really benumbed . I have been pressing my elbows on the arms of my chair , and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill , as it looked one February afternoon many years ago . Before I dozed off , I was going to tell you what Mr and Mrs Tulliver were talking about , as they sat by the bright fire in the left-hand parlour , on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of . Chapter II . Mr Tulliver , of Dorlcote Mill , Declares His Resolution about Tom “ What I want , you know , ” said Mr Tulliver , — “ what I want is to give Tom a good eddication ; an eddication as ’ ll be a bread to him . That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at Lady-day . I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer . The two years at th ’ academy ’ ud ha ’ done well enough , if I ’ d meant to make a miller and farmer of him , for he ’ s had a fine sight more schoolin ’ nor _I_ ever got . All the learnin ’ _my_ father ever paid for was a bit o ’ birch at one end and the alphabet at th ’ other . But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard , so as he might be up to the tricks o ’ these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish . It ’ ud be a help to me wi ’ these lawsuits , and arbitrations , and things . I wouldn ’ t make a downright lawyer o ’ the lad , —I should be sorry for him to be a raskill , —but a sort o ’ engineer , or a surveyor , or an auctioneer and vallyer , like Riley , or one o ’ them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay , only for a big watch-chain and a high stool . They ’ re pretty nigh all one , and they ’ re not far off being even wi ’ the law , _I_ believe ; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i ’ the face as hard as one cat looks another . _He ’ s_ none frightened at him. ” Mr Tulliver was speaking to his wife , a blond comely woman in a fan-shaped cap ( I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped caps were worn , they must be so near coming in again . At that time , when Mrs Tulliver was nearly forty , they were new at St Ogg ’ s , and considered sweet things ) . “ Well , Mr Tulliver , you know best : _I ’ ve_ no objections . But hadn ’ t I better kill a couple o ’ fowl , and have th ’ aunts and uncles to dinner next week , so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have got to say about it ? There ’ s a couple o ’ fowl _wants_ killing ! ” “ You may kill every fowl i ’ the yard if you like , Bessy ; but I shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what I ’ m to do wi ’ my own lad , ” said Mr Tulliver , defiantly . “ Dear heart ! ” said Mrs Tulliver , shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric , “ how can you talk so , Mr Tulliver ? But it ’ s your way to speak disrespectful o ’ my family ; and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo ’ me , though I ’ m sure I ’ m as innocent as the babe unborn . For nobody ’ s ever heard me say as it wasn ’ t lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can live independent . Howiver , if Tom ’ s to go to a new school , I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him ; else he might as well have calico as linen , for they ’ d be one as yallow as th ’ other before they ’ d been washed half-a-dozen times . And then , when the box is goin ’ back ’ ard and forrard , I could send the lad a cake , or a pork-pie , or an apple ; for he can do with an extry bit , bless him ! whether they stint him at the meals or no . My children can eat as much victuals as most , thank God ! ” “ Well , well , we won ’ t send him out o ’ reach o ’ the carrier ’ s cart , if other things fit in , ” said Mr Tulliver . “ But you mustn ’ t put a spoke i ’ the wheel about the washin , ’ if we can ’ t get a school near enough . That ’ s the fault I have to find wi ’ you , Bessy ; if you see a stick i ’ the road , you ’ re allays thinkin ’ you can ’ t step over it . You ’ d want me not to hire a good wagoner , ’ cause he ’ d got a mole on his face. ” “ Dear heart ! ” said Mrs Tulliver , in mild surprise , “ when did I iver make objections to a man because he ’ d got a mole on his face ? I ’ m sure I ’ m rether fond o ’ the moles ; for my brother , as is dead an ’ gone , had a mole on his brow . But I can ’ t remember your iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole , Mr Tulliver . There was John Gibbs hadn ’ t a mole on his face no more nor you have , an ’ I was all for having you hire _him_ ; an ’ so you did hire him , an ’ if he hadn ’ t died o ’ th ’ inflammation , as we paid Dr Turnbull for attending him , he ’ d very like ha ’ been drivin ’ the wagon now . He might have a mole somewhere out o ’ sight , but how was I to know that , Mr Tulliver ? ” “ No , no , Bessy ; I didn ’ t mean justly the mole ; I meant it to stand for summat else ; but niver mind—it ’ s puzzling work , talking is . What I ’ m thinking on , is how to find the right sort o ’ school to send Tom to , for I might be ta ’ en in again , as I ’ ve been wi ’ th ’ academy . I ’ ll have nothing to do wi ’ a ’ cademy again : whativer school I send Tom to , it sha ’ n ’ t be a ’ cademy ; it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i ’ summat else besides blacking the family ’ s shoes , and getting up the potatoes . It ’ s an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick. ” Mr Tulliver paused a minute or two , and dived with both hands into his breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there . Apparently he was not disappointed , for he presently said , “ I know what I ’ ll do : I ’ ll talk it over wi ’ Riley ; he ’ s coming to-morrow , t ’ arbitrate about the dam. ” “ Well , Mr Tulliver , I ’ ve put the sheets out for the best bed , and Kezia ’ s got ’ em hanging at the fire . They aren ’ t the best sheets , but they ’ re good enough for anybody to sleep in , be he who he will ; for as for them best Holland sheets , I should repent buying ’ em , only they ’ ll do to lay us out in . An ’ if you was to die to-morrow , Mr Tulliver , they ’ re mangled beautiful , an ’ all ready , an ’ smell o ’ lavender as it ’ ud be a pleasure to lay ’ em out ; an ’ they lie at the left-hand corner o ’ the big oak linen-chest at the back : not as I should trust anybody to look ’ em out but myself. ” As Mrs Tulliver uttered the last sentence , she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket , and singled out one , rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire . If Mr Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation , he might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the production of the best Holland sheets . Happily he was not so ; he was only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power ; moreover , he had the marital habit of not listening very closely , and since his mention of Mr Riley , had been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings . “ I think I ’ ve hit it , Bessy , ” was his first remark after a short silence . “ Riley ’ s as likely a man as any to know o ’ some school ; he ’ s had schooling himself , an ’ goes about to all sorts o ’ places , arbitratin ’ and vallyin ’ and that . And we shall have time to talk it over to-morrow night when the business is done . I want Tom to be such a sort o ’ man as Riley , you know , —as can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him , and knows a good lot o ’ words as don ’ t mean much , so as you can ’ t lay hold of ’ em i ’ law ; and a good solid knowledge o ’ business too. ” “ Well , ” said Mrs Tulliver , “ so far as talking proper , and knowing everything , and walking with a bend in his back , and setting his hair up , I shouldn ’ t mind the lad being brought up to that . But them fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts ; they wear a frill till it ’ s all a mess , and then hide it with a bib ; I know Riley does . And then , if Tom ’ s to go and live at Mudport , like Riley , he ’ ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in , an ’ niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast , an ’ sleep up three pair o ’ stairs , —or four , for what I know , —and be burnt to death before he can get down. ” “ No , no , ” said Mr Tulliver , “ I ’ ve no thoughts of his going to Mudport : I mean him to set up his office at St Ogg ’ s , close by us , an ’ live at home . But , ” continued Mr Tulliver after a pause , “ what I ’ m a bit afraid on is , as Tom hasn ’ t got the right sort o ’ brains for a smart fellow . I doubt he ’ s a bit slowish . He takes after your family , Bessy. ” “ Yes , that he does , ” said Mrs Tulliver , accepting the last proposition entirely on its own merits ; “ he ’ s wonderful for liking a deal o ’ salt in his broth . That was my brother ’ s way , and my father ’ s before him. ” “ It seems a bit a pity , though , ” said Mr Tulliver , “ as the lad should take after the mother ’ s side instead o ’ the little wench . That ’ s the worst on ’ t wi ’ crossing o ’ breeds : you can never justly calkilate what ’ ll come on ’ t . The little un takes after my side , now : she ’ s twice as ’ cute as Tom . Too ’ cute for a woman , I ’ m afraid , ” continued Mr Tulliver , turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other . “ It ’ s no mischief much while she ’ s a little un ; but an over- ’ cute woman ’ s no better nor a long-tailed sheep , —she ’ ll fetch none the bigger price for that. ” “ Yes , it _is_ a mischief while she ’ s a little un , Mr Tulliver , for it runs to naughtiness . How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning . An ’ now you put me i ’ mind , ” continued Mrs Tulliver , rising and going to the window , “ I don ’ t know where she is now , an ’ it ’ s pretty nigh tea-time . Ah , I thought so , —wanderin ’ up an ’ down by the water , like a wild thing : She ’ ll tumble in some day. ” Mrs Tulliver rapped the window sharply , beckoned , and shook her head , —a process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her chair . “ You talk o ’ ’ cuteness , Mr Tulliver , ” she observed as she sat down , “ but I ’ m sure the child ’ s half an idiot i ’ some things ; for if I send her upstairs to fetch anything , she forgets what she ’ s gone for , an ’ perhaps ’ ull sit down on the floor i ’ the sunshine an ’ plait her hair an ’ sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur ’ , all the while I ’ m waiting for her downstairs . That niver run i ’ my family , thank God ! no more nor a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter . I don ’ t like to fly i ’ the face o ’ Providence , but it seems hard as I should have but one gell , an ’ her so comical. ” “ Pooh , nonsense ! ” said Mr Tulliver ; “ she ’ s a straight , black-eyed wench as anybody need wish to see . I don ’ t know i ’ what she ’ s behind other folks ’ s children ; and she can read almost as well as the parson. ” “ But her hair won ’ t curl all I can do with it , and she ’ s so franzy about having it put i ’ paper , and I ’ ve such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th ’ irons. ” “ Cut it off—cut it off short , ” said the father , rashly . “ How can you talk so , Mr Tulliver ? She ’ s too big a gell—gone nine , and tall of her age—to have her hair cut short ; an ’ there ’ s her cousin Lucy ’ s got a row o ’ curls round her head , an ’ not a hair out o ’ place . It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child ; I ’ m sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does . Maggie , Maggie , ” continued the mother , in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness , as this small mistake of nature entered the room , “ where ’ s the use o ’ my telling you to keep away from the water ? You ’ ll tumble in and be drownded some day , an ’ then you ’ ll be sorry you didn ’ t do as mother told you. ” Maggie ’ s hair , as she threw off her bonnet , painfully confirmed her mother ’ s accusation . Mrs Tulliver , desiring her daughter to have a curled crop , “ like other folks ’ s children , ” had had it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears ; and as it was usually straight an hour after it had been taken out of paper , Maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark , heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes , —an action which gave her very much the air of a small Shetland pony . “ Oh , dear , oh , dear , Maggie , what are you thinkin ’ of , to throw your bonnet down there ? Take it upstairs , there ’ s a good gell , an ’ let your hair be brushed , an ’ put your other pinafore on , an ’ change your shoes , do , for shame ; an ’ come an ’ go on with your patchwork , like a little lady. ” “ Oh , mother , ” said Maggie , in a vehemently cross tone , “ I don ’ t _want_ to do my patchwork. ” “ What ! not your pretty patchwork , to make a counterpane for your aunt Glegg ? ” “ It ’ s foolish work , ” said Maggie , with a toss of her mane , — “ tearing things to pieces to sew ’ em together again . And I don ’ t want to do anything for my aunt Glegg . I don ’ t like her. ” Exit Maggie , dragging her bonnet by the string , while Mr Tulliver laughs audibly . “ I wonder at you , as you ’ ll laugh at her , Mr Tulliver , ” said the mother , with feeble fretfulness in her tone . “ You encourage her i ’ naughtiness . An ’ her aunts will have it as it ’ s me spoils her. ” Mrs Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person , —never cried , when she was a baby , on any slighter ground than hunger and pins ; and from the cradle upward had been healthy , fair , plump , and dull-witted ; in short , the flower of her family for beauty and amiability . But milk and mildness are not the best things for keeping , and when they turn only a little sour , they may disagree with young stomachs seriously . I have often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael , with the blond faces and somewhat stupid expression , kept their placidity undisturbed when their strong-limbed , strong-willed boys got a little too old to do without clothing . I think they must have been given to feeble remonstrance , getting more and more peevish as it became more and more ineffectual . Chapter III . Mr Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill , taking his brandy-and-water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver , is Mr Riley , a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands , rather highly educated for an auctioneer and appraiser , but large-hearted enough to show a great deal of _bonhomie_ toward simple country acquaintances of hospitable habits . Mr Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as “ people of the old school. ” The conversation had come to a pause . Mr Tulliver , not without a particular reason , had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix , and how Wakem had had his comb cut for once in his life , now the business of the dam had been settled by arbitration , and how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they should be , and Old Harry hadn ’ t made the lawyers . Mr Tulliver was , on the whole , a man of safe traditional opinions ; but on one or two points he had trusted to his unassisted intellect , and had arrived at several questionable",The Mill On The Floss

The birth of the Prince and the Pauper . In the ancient city of London , on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century , a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty , who did not want him . On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor , who did want him . All England wanted him too . England had so longed for him , and hoped for him , and prayed God for him , that , now that he was really come , the people went nearly mad for joy . Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried . Everybody took a holiday , and high and low , rich and poor , feasted and danced and sang , and got very mellow ; and they kept this up for days and nights together . By day , London was a sight to see , with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop , and splendid pageants marching along . By night , it was again a sight to see , with its great bonfires at every corner , and its troops of revellers making merry around them . There was no talk in all England but of the new baby , Edward Tudor , Prince of Wales , who lay lapped in silks and satins , unconscious of all this fuss , and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him -- and not caring , either . But there was no talk about the other baby , Tom Canty , lapped in his poor rags , except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence . CHAPTER II . Tom ’ s early life . Let us skip a number of years . London was fifteen hundred years old , and was a great town -- for that day . It had a hundred thousand inhabitants -- some think double as many . The streets were very narrow , and crooked , and dirty , especially in the part where Tom Canty lived , which was not far from London Bridge . The houses were of wood , with the second story projecting over the first , and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second . The higher the houses grew , the broader they grew . They were skeletons of strong criss-cross beams , with solid material between , coated with plaster . The beams were painted red or blue or black , according to the owner ’ s taste , and this gave the houses a very picturesque look . The windows were small , glazed with little diamond-shaped panes , and they opened outward , on hinges , like doors . The house which Tom ’ s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called Offal Court , out of Pudding Lane . It was small , decayed , and rickety , but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families . Canty ’ s tribe occupied a room on the third floor . The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner ; but Tom , his grandmother , and his two sisters , Bet and Nan , were not restricted -- they had all the floor to themselves , and might sleep where they chose . There were the remains of a blanket or two , and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw , but these could not rightly be called beds , for they were not organised ; they were kicked into a general pile , mornings , and selections made from the mass at night , for service . Bet and Nan were fifteen years old -- twins . They were good-hearted girls , unclean , clothed in rags , and profoundly ignorant . Their mother was like them . But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends . They got drunk whenever they could ; then they fought each other or anybody else who came in the way ; they cursed and swore always , drunk or sober ; John Canty was a thief , and his mother a beggar . They made beggars of the children , but failed to make thieves of them . Among , but not of , the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house , was a good old priest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings , and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly . Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin , and how to read and write ; and would have done the same with the girls , but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends , who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them . All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty ’ s house . Drunkenness , riot and brawling were the order , there , every night and nearly all night long . Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place . Yet little Tom was not unhappy . He had a hard time of it , but did not know it . It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had , therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing . When he came home empty-handed at night , he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first , and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it ; and that away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself , notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband . No , Tom ’ s life went along well enough , especially in summer . He only begged just enough to save himself , for the laws against mendicancy were stringent , and the penalties heavy ; so he put in a good deal of his time listening to good Father Andrew ’ s charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies , dwarfs and genii , and enchanted castles , and gorgeous kings and princes . His head grew to be full of these wonderful things , and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw , tired , hungry , and smarting from a thrashing , he unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace . One desire came in time to haunt him day and night : it was to see a real prince , with his own eyes . He spoke of it once to some of his Offal Court comrades ; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that . He often read the priest ’ s old books and got him to explain and enlarge upon them . His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him , by-and-by . His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt , and to wish to be clean and better clad . He went on playing in the mud just the same , and enjoying it , too ; but , instead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it , he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it afforded . Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside , and at the fairs ; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the Tower , by land or boat . One summer ’ s day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield , and heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him . Yes , Tom ’ s life was varied and pleasant enough , on the whole . By-and-by Tom ’ s reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to _act_ the prince , unconsciously . His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly , to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates . But Tom ’ s influence among these young people began to grow now , day by day ; and in time he came to be looked up to , by them , with a sort of wondering awe , as a superior being . He seemed to know so much ! and he could do and say such marvellous things ! and withal , he was so deep and wise ! Full-grown people brought their perplexities to Tom for solution , and were often astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions . In fact he was become a hero to all who knew him except his own family -- these , only , saw nothing in him . Privately , after a while , Tom organised a royal court ! He was the prince ; his special comrades were guards , chamberlains , equerries , lords and ladies in waiting , and the royal family . Daily the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic readings ; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council , and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies , navies , and viceroyalties . After which , he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings , eat his poor crust , take his customary cuffs and abuse , and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw , and resume his empty grandeurs in his dreams . And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince , in the flesh , grew upon him , day by day , and week by week , until at last it absorbed all other desires , and became the one passion of his life . One January day , on his usual begging tour , he tramped despondently up and down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap , hour after hour , bare-footed and cold , looking in at cook-shop windows and longing for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed there -- for to him these were dainties fit for the angels ; that is , judging by the smell , they were -- for it had never been his good luck to own and eat one . There was a cold drizzle of rain ; the atmosphere was murky ; it was a melancholy day . At night Tom reached home so wet and tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved -- after their fashion ; wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed . For a long time his pain and hunger , and the swearing and fighting going on in the building , kept him awake ; but at last his thoughts drifted away to far , romantic lands , and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces , and had servants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders . And then , as usual , he dreamed that _he_ was a princeling himself . All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him ; he moved among great lords and ladies , in a blaze of light , breathing perfumes , drinking in delicious music , and answering the reverent obeisances of the glittering throng as it parted to make way for him , with here a smile , and there a nod of his princely head . And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about him , his dream had had its usual effect -- it had intensified the sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold . Then came bitterness , and heart-break , and tears . CHAPTER III . Tom ’ s meeting with the Prince . Tom got up hungry , and sauntered hungry away , but with his thoughts busy with the shadowy splendours of his night ’ s dreams . He wandered here and there in the city , hardly noticing where he was going , or what was happening around him . People jostled him , and some gave him rough speech ; but it was all lost on the musing boy . By-and-by he found himself at Temple Bar , the farthest from home he had ever travelled in that direction . He stopped and considered a moment , then fell into his imaginings again , and passed on outside the walls of London . The Strand had ceased to be a country-road then , and regarded itself as a street , but by a strained construction ; for , though there was a tolerably compact row of houses on one side of it , there were only some scattered great buildings on the other , these being palaces of rich nobles , with ample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river -- grounds that are now closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone . Tom discovered Charing Village presently , and rested himself at the beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days ; then idled down a quiet , lovely road , past the great cardinal ’ s stately palace , toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond -- Westminster . Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry , the wide-spreading wings , the frowning bastions and turrets , the huge stone gateway , with its gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions , and other the signs and symbols of English royalty . Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last ? Here , indeed , was a king ’ s palace . Might he not hope to see a prince now -- a prince of flesh and blood , if Heaven were willing ? At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue -- that is to say , an erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms , clad from head to heel in shining steel armour . At a respectful distance were many country folk , and people from the city , waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that might offer . Splendid carriages , with splendid people in them and splendid servants outside , were arriving and departing by several other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure . Poor little Tom , in his rags , approached , and was moving slowly and timidly past the sentinels , with a beating heart and a rising hope , when all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that almost made him shout for joy . Within was a comely boy , tanned and brown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises , whose clothing was all of lovely silks and satins , shining with jewels ; at his hip a little jewelled sword and dagger ; dainty buskins on his feet , with red heels ; and on his head a jaunty crimson cap , with drooping plumes fastened with a great sparkling gem . Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near -- his servants , without a doubt . Oh ! he was a prince -- a prince , a living prince , a real prince -- without the shadow of a question ; and the prayer of the pauper-boy ’ s heart was answered at last . Tom ’ s breath came quick and short with excitement , and his eyes grew big with wonder and delight . Everything gave way in his mind instantly to one desire : that was to get close to the prince , and have a good , devouring look at him . Before he knew what he was about , he had his face against the gate-bars . The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him rudely away , and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks and London idlers . The soldier said , -- “ Mind thy manners , thou young beggar ! ” The crowd jeered and laughed ; but the young prince sprang to the gate with his face flushed , and his eyes flashing with indignation , and cried out , -- “ How dar ’ st thou use a poor lad like that ? How dar ’ st thou use the King my father ’ s meanest subject so ? Open the gates , and let him in ! ” You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then . You should have heard them cheer , and shout , “ Long live the Prince of Wales ! ” The soldiers presented arms with their halberds , opened the gates , and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in , in his fluttering rags , to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty . Edward Tudor said -- “ Thou lookest tired and hungry : thou ’ st been treated ill. Come with me. ” Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to -- I don ’ t know what ; interfere , no doubt . But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture , and they stopped stock still where they were , like so many statues . Edward took Tom to a rich apartment in the palace , which he called his cabinet . By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before except in books . The prince , with princely delicacy and breeding , sent away the servants , so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by their critical presence ; then he sat near by , and asked questions while Tom ate . “ What is thy name , lad ? ” “ Tom Canty , an ’ it please thee , sir. ” “ ‘ Tis an odd one . Where dost live ? ” “ In the city , please thee , sir . Offal Court , out of Pudding Lane. ” “ Offal Court ! Truly ’ tis another odd one . Hast parents ? ” “ Parents have I , sir , and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently precious to me , God forgive me if it be offence to say it -- also twin sisters , Nan and Bet. ” “ Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee , I take it ? ” “ Neither to any other is she , so please your worship . She hath a wicked heart , and worketh evil all her days. ” “ Doth she mistreat thee ? ” “ There be times that she stayeth her hand , being asleep or overcome with drink ; but when she hath her judgment clear again , she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings. ” A fierce look came into the little prince ’ s eyes , and he cried out -- “ What ! Beatings ? ” “ Oh , indeed , yes , please you , sir. ” “ _Beatings_ ! -- and thou so frail and little . Hark ye : before the night come , she shall hie her to the Tower . The King my father ” -- “ In sooth , you forget , sir , her low degree . The Tower is for the great alone. ” “ True , indeed . I had not thought of that . I will consider of her punishment . Is thy father kind to thee ? ” “ Not more than Gammer Canty , sir. ” “ Fathers be alike , mayhap . Mine hath not a doll ’ s temper . He smiteth with a heavy hand , yet spareth me : he spareth me not always with his tongue , though , sooth to say . How doth thy mother use thee ? ” “ She is good , sir , and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort . And Nan and Bet are like to her in this. ” “ How old be these ? ” “ Fifteen , an ’ it please you , sir. ” “ The Lady Elizabeth , my sister , is fourteen , and the Lady Jane Grey , my cousin , is of mine own age , and comely and gracious withal ; but my sister the Lady Mary , with her gloomy mien and -- Look you : do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile , lest the sin destroy their souls ? ” “ They ? Oh , dost think , sir , that _they_ have servants ? ” The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment , then said -- “ And prithee , why not ? Who helpeth them undress at night ? Who attireth them when they rise ? ” “ None , sir . Would ’ st have them take off their garment , and sleep without -- like the beasts ? ” “ Their garment ! Have they but one ? ” “ Ah , good your worship , what would they do with more ? Truly they have not two bodies each. ” “ It is a quaint and marvellous thought ! Thy pardon , I had not meant to laugh . But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow , and that soon , too : my cofferer shall look to it . No , thank me not ; ’ tis nothing . Thou speakest well ; thou hast an easy grace in it . Art learned ? ” “ I know not if I am or not , sir . The good priest that is called Father Andrew taught me , of his kindness , from his books. ” “ Know ’ st thou the Latin ? ” “ But scantly , sir , I doubt. ” “ Learn it , lad : ’ tis hard only at first . The Greek is harder ; but neither these nor any tongues else , I think , are hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin . Thou should ’ st hear those damsels at it ! But tell me of thy Offal Court . Hast thou a pleasant life there ? ” “ In truth , yes , so please you , sir , save when one is hungry . There be Punch-and-Judy shows , and monkeys -- oh such antic creatures ! and so bravely dressed ! -- and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain , and ’ tis so fine to see , and costeth but a farthing -- albeit ’ tis main hard to get the farthing , please your worship. ” “ Tell me more. ” “ We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel , like to the fashion of the ‘ prentices , sometimes. ” The prince ’ s eyes flashed . Said he -- “ Marry , that would not I mislike . Tell me more. ” “ We strive in races , sir , to see who of us shall be fleetest. ” “ That would I like also . Speak on. ” “ In summer , sir , we wade and swim in the canals and in the river , and each doth duck his neighbour , and splatter him with water , and dive and shout and tumble and -- ” “ ‘ Twould be worth my father ’ s kingdom but to enjoy it once ! Prithee go on. ” “ We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside ; we play in the sand , each covering his neighbour up ; and times we make mud pastry -- oh the lovely mud , it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world ! -- we do fairly wallow in the mud , sir , saving your worship ’ s presence. ” “ Oh , prithee , say no more , ’ tis glorious ! If that I could but clothe me in raiment like to thine , and strip my feet , and revel in the mud once , just once , with none to rebuke me or forbid , meseemeth I could forego the crown ! ” “ And if that I could clothe me once , sweet sir , as thou art clad -- just once -- ” “ Oho , would ’ st like it ? Then so shall it be . Doff thy rags , and don these splendours , lad ! It is a brief happiness , but will be not less keen for that . We will have it while we may , and change again before any come to molest. ” A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom ’ s fluttering odds and ends , and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty . The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror , and lo , a miracle : there did not seem to have been any change made ! They stared at each other , then at the glass , then at each other again . At last the puzzled princeling said -- “ What dost thou make of this ? ” “ Ah , good your worship , require me not to answer . It is not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing. ” “ Then will _I_ utter it . Thou hast the same hair , the same eyes , the same voice and manner , the same form and stature , the same face and countenance that I bear . Fared we forth naked , there is none could say which was you , and which the Prince of Wales . And , now that I am clothed as thou wert clothed , it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier -- Hark ye , is not this a bruise upon your hand ? ” “ Yes ; but it is a slight thing , and your worship knoweth that the poor man-at-arms -- ” “ Peace ! It was a shameful thing and a cruel ! ” cried the little prince , stamping his bare foot . “ If the King -- Stir not a step till I come again ! It is a command ! ” In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table , and was out at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags , with a hot face and glowing eyes . As soon as he reached the great gate , he seized the bars , and tried to shake them , shouting -- “ Open ! Unbar the gates ! ” The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly ; and as the prince burst through the portal , half-smothered with royal wrath , the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway , and said -- “ Take that , thou beggar ’ s spawn , for what thou got ’ st me from his Highness ! ” The crowd roared with laughter . The prince picked himself out of the mud , and made fiercely at the sentry , shouting -- “ I am the Prince of Wales , my person is sacred ; and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me ! ” The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly -- “ I salute your gracious Highness. ” Then angrily -- “ Be off , thou crazy rubbish ! ” Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince , and hustled him far down the road , hooting him , and shouting -- “ Way for his Royal Highness ! Way for the Prince of Wales ! ” CHAPTER IV . The Prince ’ s troubles begin . After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution , the little prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself . As long as he had been able to rage against the mob , and threaten it royally , and royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at , he was very entertaining ; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent , he was no longer of use to his tormentors , and they sought amusement elsewhere . He looked about him , now , but could not recognise the locality . He was within the city of London -- that was all he knew . He moved on , aimlessly , and in a little while the houses thinned , and the passers-by were infrequent . He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then where Farringdon Street now is ; rested a few moments , then passed on , and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it , and a prodigious church . He recognised this church . Scaffoldings were about , everywhere , and swarms of workmen ; for it was undergoing elaborate repairs . The prince took heart at once -- he felt that his troubles were at an end , now . He said to himself , “ It is the ancient Grey Friars ’ Church , which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children , and new-named it Christ ’ s Church . Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously by them -- and the more that that son is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day , or ever shall be. ” He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running , jumping , playing at ball and leap-frog , and otherwise disporting themselves , and right noisily , too . They were all dressed alike , and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and ‘ prentices { 1 } -- that is to say , each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer , which was not useful as a covering , it being of such scanty dimensions , neither was it ornamental ; from beneath it the hair fell , unparted , to the middle of the forehead , and was cropped straight around ; a clerical band at the neck ; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower ; full sleeves ; a broad red belt ; bright yellow stockings , gartered above the knees ; low shoes with large metal buckles . It was a sufficiently ugly costume . The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince , who said with native dignity -- “ Good lads , say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth speech with him. ” A great shout went up at this , and one rude fellow said -- “ Marry , art thou his grace ’ s messenger , beggar ? ” The prince ’ s face flushed with anger , and his ready hand flew to his hip , but there was nothing there . He fancied he had a sword -- belike he is the prince himself. ” This sally brought more laughter . Poor Edward drew himself up proudly and said -- “ I am the prince ; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my father ’ s bounty to use me so. ” This was vastly enjoyed , as the laughter testified . The youth who had first spoken , shouted to his comrades -- “ Ho , swine , slaves , pensioners of his grace ’ s princely father , where be your manners ? Down on your marrow bones , all of ye , and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags ! ” With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did mock homage to their prey . The prince spurned the nearest boy with his foot , and said fiercely -- “ Take thou that , till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet ! ” Ah , but this was not a joke -- this was going beyond fun . The laughter ceased on the instant , and fury took its place . A dozen shouted -- “ Hale him forth ! To the horse-pond , to the horse-pond ! Where be the dogs ? Ho , there , Lion ! ho , Fangs ! ” Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before -- the sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands , and set upon and torn by dogs . As night drew to a close that day , the prince found himself far down in the close-built portion of the city . His body was bruised , his hands were bleeding , and his rags were all besmirched with mud . He wandered on and on , and grew more and more bewildered , and so tired and faint he could hardly drag one foot after the other . He had ceased to ask questions of anyone , since they brought him only insult instead of information . He kept muttering to himself , “ Offal Court -- that is the name ; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop , then am I saved -- for his people will take me to the palace and prove that I am none of theirs , but the true prince , and I shall have mine own again. ” And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those rude Christ ’ s Hospital boys , and he said , “ When I am king , they shall not have bread and shelter only , but also teachings out of books ; for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved , and the heart . I will keep this diligently in my remembrance , that this day ’ s lesson be not lost upon me , and my people suffer thereby ; for learning softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity. ” { 1 } The lights began to twinkle , it came on to rain , the wind rose , and a raw and gusty night set in . The houseless prince , the homeless heir to the throne of England , still moved on , drifting deeper into the maze of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed together . Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said -- “ Out to this time of night again , and hast not brought a farthing home , I warrant me ! If it be so , an ’ I do not break all the bones in thy lean body , then am I not John Canty , but some other. ” The prince twisted himself loose , unconsciously brushed his profaned shoulder , and eagerly said -- “ Oh , art _his_ father , truly ? Sweet heaven grant it be so -- then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me ! ” “ _His_ father ? I know not what thou mean ’ st ; I but know I am _thy_ father , as thou shalt soon have cause to -- ” “ Oh , jest not , palter not , delay not ! -- I am worn , I am wounded , I can bear no more . Take me to the king my father , and he will make thee rich beyond thy wildest dreams . Believe me , man , believe me ! -- I speak no lie , but only the truth ! -- put forth thy hand and save me ! I am indeed the Prince of Wales ! ” The man stared down , stupefied , upon the lad , then shook his head and muttered -- “ Gone stark mad as any Tom o ’ Bedlam ! ” -- then collared him once more , and said with a coarse laugh and an oath , “ But mad or no mad , I and thy Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie , or I ’ m no true man ! ” With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away , and disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of human vermin . CHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician . Tom Canty , left alone in the prince ’ s cabinet , made good use of his opportunity . He turned himself this way and that before the great mirror , admiring his finery ; then walked away , imitating the prince ’ s high-bred carriage , and still observing results in the glass . Next he drew the beautiful sword , and bowed , kissing the blade , and laying it across his breast , as he had seen a noble knight do , by way of salute to the lieutenant of the Tower , five or six weeks before , when delivering the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity . Tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh ; he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room ; he tried each of the sumptuous chairs , and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur . He wondered if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home , or if they would shake their heads , and say his overtaxed imagination had at last upset his reason . At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince was gone a long time ; then right away he began to feel lonely ; very soon he fell to listening and longing , and ceased to toy with the pretty things about him ; he grew uneasy , then restless , then distressed . Suppose some one should come , and catch him in the prince ’ s clothes , and the prince not there to explain . Might they not hang him at once , and inquire into his case afterward ? He had heard that the great were prompt about small matters . His fear rose higher and higher ; and trembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber , resolved to fly and seek the prince , and , through him , protection and release . Six gorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree , clothed like butterflies , sprang to their feet and bowed low before him . He stepped quickly back and shut the door . He said -- “ Oh , they mock at me ! They will go and tell . Oh ! why came I here to cast away my life ? ” He walked up and down the floor , filled with nameless fears , listening , starting at every trifling sound . Presently the door swung open , and a silken page said -- “ The Lady Jane Grey. ” The door closed and a sweet young girl , richly clad , bounded toward him . But she stopped suddenly , and said in a distressed voice -- “ Oh , what aileth thee , my lord ? ” Tom ’ s breath was nearly failing him ; but he made shift to stammer out -- “ Ah , be merciful , thou ! In sooth I am no lord , but only poor Tom Canty of Offal Court in the city . Prithee let me see the prince , and he will of his grace restore to me my rags , and let me hence unhurt . Oh , be thou merciful , and save me ! ” By this time the boy was on his knees , and supplicating with his eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue . The young girl seemed horror-stricken . She cried out -- “ O my lord , on thy knees ? -- and to _me_ ! ” Then she fled away in fright ; and Tom , smitten with despair , sank down , murmuring -- “ There is no help , there is no hope . Now will they come and take me. ” Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror , dreadful tidings were speeding through the palace . The whisper -- for it was whispered always -- flew from menial to menial , from lord to lady , down all the long corridors , from story to story , from saloon to saloon , “ The prince hath gone mad , the prince hath gone mad ! ” Soon every saloon , every marble hall , had its groups of glittering lords and ladies , and other groups of dazzling lesser folk , talking earnestly together in whispers , and every face had in it dismay . Presently a splendid official came marching by these groups , making solemn proclamation -- “ IN THE NAME OF THE KING ! Let none list to this false and foolish matter , upon pain of death , nor discuss the same , nor carry it abroad . In the name of the King ! ” The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been stricken dumb . Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors , of “ The prince ! See , the prince comes ! ” Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups , trying to bow in return , and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with bewildered and pathetic eyes . Great nobles walked upon each side of him , making him lean upon them , and so steady his steps . Behind him followed the court-physicians and some servants . Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard the door close behind him . Around him stood those who had come with him . Before him , at a little distance , reclined a very large and very fat man , with a wide , pulpy face , and a stern expression . His large head was very grey ; and his whiskers , which he wore only around his face , like a frame , were grey also . His clothing was of rich stuff , but old , and slightly frayed in places . One of his swollen legs had a pillow under it , and was wrapped in bandages . There was silence now ; and there was no head there but was bent in reverence , except this man ’ s . This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII . He said -- and his face grew gentle as he began to speak -- “ How now , my lord Edward , my prince ? Hast been minded to cozen me , the good King thy father , who loveth thee , and kindly useth thee , with a sorry jest ? ” Poor Tom was listening , as well as his dazed faculties would let him , to the beginning of this speech ; but when the words ‘ me , the good King ’ fell upon his ear , his face blanched , and he dropped as instantly upon his knees as if a shot had brought him there . Lifting up his hands , he exclaimed -- “ Thou the _King_ ? Then am I undone indeed ! ” This speech seemed to stun the King . His eyes wandered from face to face aimlessly , then rested , bewildered , upon the boy before him . Then he said in a tone of deep disappointment -- “ Alack , I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth ; but I fear me ’ tis not so. ” He breathed a heavy sigh , and said in a gentle voice , “ Come to thy father , child : thou art not well. ” Tom was assisted to his feet , and approached the Majesty of England , humble and trembling . The King took the frightened face between his hands , and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile , as if seeking some grateful sign of returning reason there , then pressed the curly head against his breast , and patted it tenderly . Presently he said -- “ Dost not know thy father , child ? Break not mine old heart ; say thou know ’ st me . Thou _dost_ know me , dost thou not ? ” “ Yea : thou art my dread lord the King , whom God preserve ! ” “ True , true -- that is well -- be comforted , tremble not so ; there is none here would hurt thee ; there is none here but loves thee . Thou art better now ; thy ill dream passeth -- is ’ t not so ? Thou wilt not miscall thyself again , as they say thou didst a little while agone ? ” “ I pray thee of thy grace believe me , I did but speak the truth , most dread lord ; for I am the meanest among thy subjects , being a pauper born , and ’ tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here , albeit I was therein nothing blameful . I am but young to die , and thou canst save me with one little word . Oh speak it , sir ! ” “ Die ? Talk not so , sweet prince -- peace , peace , to thy troubled heart -- thou shalt not die ! ” Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry -- “ God requite thy mercy , O my King , and save thee long to bless thy land ! ” Then springing up , he turned a joyful face toward the two lords in waiting , and exclaimed , “ Thou heard ’ st it ! I am not to die : the King hath said it ! ” There was no movement , save that all bowed with grave respect ; but no one spoke . He hesitated , a little confused , then turned timidly toward the King , saying , “ I may go now ? ” “ Go ? Surely , if thou desirest . But why not tarry yet a little ? Whither would ’ st go ? ” Tom dropped his eyes , and answered humbly -- “ Peradventure I mistook ; but I did think me free , and so was I moved to seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery , yet which harboureth my mother and my sisters , and so is home to me ; whereas these pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used -- oh , please you , sir , to let me go ! ” The King was silent and thoughtful a while , and his face betrayed a growing distress and uneasiness . Presently he said , with something of hope in his voice -- “ Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain , and hath his wits unmarred as toucheth other matter . God send it may be so ! We will make trial. ” Then he asked Tom a question in Latin , and Tom answered him lamely in the same tongue . The lords and doctors manifested their gratification also . The King said -- “ ‘ Twas not according to his schooling and ability , but showeth that his mind is but diseased , not stricken fatally . Tom stood silent a moment , embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him , then said diffidently -- “ I have no knowledge of this tongue , so please your majesty. ” The King fell back upon his couch . The attendants flew to his assistance ; but he put them aside , and said -- “ Trouble me not -- it is nothing but a scurvy faintness . Raise me ! There , ‘ tis sufficient . Come hither , child ; there , rest thy poor troubled head upon thy father ’ s heart , and be at peace . Thou ’ lt soon be well : ’ tis but a passing fantasy . Fear thou not ; thou ’ lt soon be well. ” Then he turned toward the company : his gentle manner changed , and baleful lightnings began to play from his eyes . He said -- “ List ye all ! This my son is mad ; but it is not permanent . Over-study hath done this , and somewhat too much of confinement . Away with his books and teachers ! see ye to it . Pleasure him with sports , beguile him in wholesome ways , so that his health come again. ” He raised himself higher still , and went on with energy , “ He is mad ; but he is my son , and England ’ s heir ; and , mad or sane , still shall he reign ! And hear ye further , and proclaim it : whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms , and shall to the gallows ! . . . Give me to drink -- I burn : this sorrow sappeth my strength . . . . There , take away the cup . . . . Support me . There , that is well . Mad , is he ? Were he a thousand times mad , yet is he Prince of Wales , and I the King will confirm it . This very morrow shall he be installed in his princely dignity in due and ancient form . Take instant order for it , my lord Hertford. ” One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch , and said -- “ The King ’ s majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England lieth attainted in the Tower . It were not meet that one attainted -- ” “ Peace ! Insult not mine ears with his hated name . Is this man to live for ever ? Am I to be baulked of my will ? Is the prince to tarry uninstalled , because , forsooth , the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours ? No , by the splendour of God ! Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk ’ s doom before the sun rise again , else shall they answer for it grievously ! ” { 1 } Lord Hertford said -- “ The King ’ s will is law ; ” and , rising , returned to his former place . Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King ’ s face , and he said -- “ Kiss me , my prince . There . . . what fearest thou ? Am I not thy loving father ? ” “ Thou art good to me that am unworthy , O mighty and gracious lord : that in truth I know . But -- but -- it grieveth me to think of him that is to die , and -- ” “ Ah , ’ tis like thee , ’ tis like thee ! I know thy heart is still the same , even though thy mind hath suffered hurt , for thou wert ever of a gentle spirit . But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours : I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great office . Comfort thee , my prince : trouble not thy poor head with this matter. ” “ But is it not I that speed him hence , my liege ? How long might he not live , but for me ? ” “ Take no thought of him , my prince : he is not worthy . Kiss me once again , and go to thy trifles and amusements ; for my malady distresseth me . I am aweary , and would rest . Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy people , and come again when my body is refreshed. ” Tom , heavy-hearted , was conducted from the presence , for this last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would be set free . Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming , “ The prince , the prince comes ! ” His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering files of bowing courtiers ; for he recognised that he was indeed a captive now , and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage , a forlorn and friendless prince , except God in his mercy take pity on him and set him free . And , turn where he would , he seemed to see floating in the air the severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk , the eyes fixed on him reproachfully . His old dreams had been so pleasant ; but this reality was so dreary ! CHAPTER VI . Tom receives instructions . Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite , and made to sit down -- a thing which he was loth to do , since there were elderly men and men of high degree about him . He begged them to be seated also , but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them , and remained standing . He would have insisted , but his ‘ uncle ’ the Earl of Hertford whispered in his ear -- “ Prithee , insist not , my lord ; it is not meet that they sit in thy presence. ” The Lord St. John was announced , and after making obeisance to Tom , he said -- “ I come upon the King ’ s errand , concerning a matter which requireth privacy . Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend you here , save my lord the Earl of Hertford ? ” Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed , Hertford whispered him to make a sign with his hand , and not trouble himself to speak unless he chose . When the waiting gentlemen had retired , Lord St. John said -- “ His majesty commandeth , that for due and weighty reasons of state , the prince ’ s grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his power , till it be passed and he be as he was before . To wit , that he shall deny to none that he is the true prince , and heir to England ’ s greatness ; that he shall uphold his princely dignity , and shall receive , without word or sign of protest , that reverence and observance which unto it do appertain of right and ancient usage ; that he shall cease to speak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the unwholesome imaginings of o ’ er-wrought fancy ; that he shall strive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he was wont to know -- and where he faileth he shall hold his peace , neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath forgot ; that upon occasions of state , whensoever any matter shall perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should make , he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on , but take advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford , or my humble self , which are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at call , till this commandment be dissolved . Thus saith the King ’ s majesty , who sendeth greeting to your royal highness , and prayeth that God will of His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy keeping. ” The Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside . Tom replied resignedly -- “ The King hath said it . None may palter with the King ’ s command , or fit it to his ease , where it doth chafe , with deft evasions . The King shall be obeyed. ” Lord Hertford said -- “ Touching the King ’ s majesty ’ s ordainment concerning books and such like serious matters , it may peradventure please your highness to ease your time with lightsome entertainment , lest you go wearied to the banquet and suffer harm thereby. ” Tom ’ s face showed inquiring surprise ; and a blush followed when he saw Lord St. John ’ s eyes bent sorrowfully upon him . His lordship said -- “ Thy memory still wrongeth thee , and thou hast shown surprise -- but suffer it not to trouble thee , for ’ tis a matter that will not bide , but depart with thy mending malady . My Lord of Hertford speaketh of the city ’ s banquet which the King ’ s majesty did promise , some two months flown , your highness should attend . Thou recallest it now ? ” “ It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me , ” said Tom , in a hesitating voice ; and blushed again . At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced . The two lords exchanged significant glances , and Hertford stepped quickly toward the door . As the young girls passed him , he said in a low voice -- “ I pray ye , ladies , seem not to observe his humours , nor show surprise when his memory doth lapse -- it will grieve you to note how it doth stick at every trifle. ” Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom ’ s ear -- “ Please you , sir , keep diligently in mind his majesty ’ s desire . Remember all thou canst -- _seem_ to remember all else . Let them not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont , for thou knowest how tenderly thy old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how ’ twould grieve them . Art willing , sir , that I remain ? -- and thine uncle ? ” Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word , for he was already learning , and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself as best he might , according to the King ’ s command . In spite of every precaution , the conversation among the young people became a little embarrassing at times . More than once , in truth , Tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his tremendous part ; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him , or a word from one or the other of the vigilant lords , thrown in apparently by chance , had the same happy effect . Once the little Lady Jane turned to Tom and dismayed him with this question , -- “ Hast paid thy duty to the Queen ’ s majesty to-day , my lord ? ” Tom hesitated , looked distressed , and was about to stammer out something at hazard , when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate difficulties and to be ready for them -- “ He hath indeed , madam , and she did greatly hearten him , as touching his majesty ’ s condition ; is it not so , your highness ? ” Tom mumbled something that stood for assent , but felt that he was getting upon dangerous ground . Somewhat later it was mentioned that Tom was to study no more at present , whereupon her little ladyship exclaimed -- “ ‘ Tis a pity , ’ tis a pity ! Thou wert proceeding bravely . But bide thy time in patience : it will not be for long . Thou ’ lt yet be graced with learning like thy father , and make thy tongue master of as many languages as his , good my prince. ” “ My father ! ” cried Tom , off his guard for the moment . “ I trow he can not speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may tell his meaning ; and as for learning of any sort soever -- ” He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John ’ s eyes . He stopped , blushed , then continued low and sadly : “ Ah , my malady persecuteth me again , and my mind wandereth . I meant the King ’ s grace no irreverence. ” “ We know it , sir , ” said the Princess Elizabeth , taking her ‘ brother ’ s ’ hand between her two palms , respectfully but caressingly ; “ trouble not thyself as to that . The fault is none of thine , but thy distemper ’ s. ” “ Thou ’ rt a gentle comforter , sweet lady , ” said Tom , gratefully , “ and my heart moveth me to thank thee for ’ t , an ’ I may be so bold. ” Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom . The Princess Elizabeth ’ s quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the target ’ s front that the shaft was overshot ; so she tranquilly delivered a return volley of sounding Greek on Tom ’ s behalf , and then straightway changed the talk to other matters . Time wore on pleasantly , and likewise smoothly , on the whole . Snags and sandbars grew less and less frequent , and Tom grew more and more at his ease , seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and overlooking his mistakes . When it came out that the little ladies were to accompany him to the Lord Mayor ’ s banquet in the evening , his heart gave a bound of relief and delight , for he felt that he should not be friendless , now , among that multitude of strangers ; whereas , an hour earlier , the idea of their going with him would have been an insupportable terror to him . Tom ’ s guardian angels , the two lords , had had less comfort in the interview than the other parties to it . They felt much as if they were piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel ; they were on the alert constantly , and found their office no child ’ s play . Wherefore , at last , when the ladies ’ visit was drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford Dudley was announced , they not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the present , but also that they themselves were not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all over again . So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse himself , which he was very glad to do , although a slight shade of disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane ’ s face when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance . There was a pause now , a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not understand . He glanced at Lord Hertford , who gave him a sign -- but he failed to understand that also . The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue with her usual easy grace . She made reverence and said -- “ Have we leave of the prince ’ s grace my brother to go ? ” Tom said -- “ Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will , for the asking ; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor power lieth , than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence hence . Give ye good den , and God be with ye ! ” Then he smiled inwardly at the thought , “ ‘ Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in my reading , and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered and gracious speech withal ! ” When the illustrious maidens were gone , Tom turned wearily to his keepers and said -- “ May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner and rest me ? ” Lord Hertford said -- “ So please your highness , it is for you to command , it is for us to obey . That thou should ’ st rest is indeed a needful thing , since thou must journey to the city presently. ” He touched a bell , and a page appeared , who was ordered to desire the presence of Sir William Herbert . This gentleman came straightway , and conducted Tom to an inner apartment . Tom ’ s first movement there was to reach for a cup of water ; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it , dropped upon one knee , and offered it to him on a golden salver . Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins , timidly asking leave with his eye , but another silk-and-velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him . He made two or three further efforts to help himself , but being promptly forestalled each time , he finally gave up , with a sigh of resignation and a murmured “ Beshrew me , but I marvel they do not require to breathe for me also ! ” Slippered , and wrapped in a sumptuous robe , he laid himself down at last to rest , but not to sleep , for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people . He could not dismiss the former , so they stayed ; he did not know enough to dismiss the latter , so they stayed also , to his vast regret -- and theirs . Tom ’ s departure had left his two noble guardians alone . They mused a while , with much head-shaking and walking the floor , then Lord St. John said -- “ Plainly , what dost thou think ? ” “ Plainly , then , this . The King is near his end ; my nephew is mad -- mad will mount the throne , and mad remain . God protect England , since she will need it ! ” “ Verily it promiseth so , indeed . But . . . have you no misgivings as to . . . as to . . . ” The speaker hesitated , and finally stopped . He evidently felt that he was upon delicate ground . Lord Hertford stopped before him , looked into his face with a clear , frank eye , and said -- “ Speak on -- there is none to hear but me . Misgivings as to what ? ” “ I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind , and thou so near to him in blood , my lord . But craving pardon if I do offend , seemeth it not strange that madness could so change his port and manner ? -- not but that his port and speech are princely still , but that they _differ_ , in one unweighty trifle or another , from what his custom was aforetime . Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his father ’ s very lineaments ; the customs and observances that are his due from such as be about him ; and , leaving him his Latin , strip him of his Greek and French ? My lord , be not offended , but ease my mind of its disquiet and receive my grateful thanks . It haunteth me , his saying he was not the prince , and so -- ” “ Peace , my lord , thou utterest treason ! Hast forgot the King ’ s command ? Remember I am party to thy crime if I but listen. ” St. John paled , and hastened to say -- “ I was in fault , I do confess it . Betray me not , grant me this grace out of thy courtesy , and I will neither think nor speak of this thing more . Deal not hardly with me , sir , else am I ruined. ” “ I am content , my lord . So thou offend not again , here or in the ears of others , it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken . But thou need ’ st not have misgivings . He is my sister ’ s son ; are not his voice , his face , his form , familiar to me from his cradle ? Madness can do all the odd conflicting things thou seest in him , and more . Dost not recall how that the old Baron Marley , being mad , forgot the favour of his own countenance that he had known for sixty years , and held it was another ’ s ; nay , even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene , and that his head was made of Spanish glass ; and , sooth to say , he suffered none to touch it , lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it ? Give thy misgivings easement , good my lord . This is the very prince -- I know him well -- and soon will be thy king ; it may advantage thee to bear this in mind , and more dwell upon it than the other. ” After some further talk , in which the Lord St. John covered up his mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was thoroughly grounded now , and could not be assailed by doubts again , the Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper , and sat down to keep watch and ward alone . He was soon deep in meditation , and evidently the longer he thought , the more he was bothered . By-and-by he began to pace the floor and mutter . “ Tush , he _must_ be the prince ! Will any be in all the land maintain there can be two , not of one blood and birth , so marvellously twinned ? And even were it so , ’ twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the other ’ s place . Nay , ’ tis folly , folly , folly ! ” Presently he said -- “ Now were he impostor and called himself prince , look you _that_ would be natural ; that would be reasonable . But lived ever an impostor yet , who , being called prince by the king , prince by the court , prince by all , _denied_ his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation ? _No_ ! By the soul of St. Swithin , no ! This is the true prince , gone mad ! ” CHAPTER VII . Tom ’ s first royal dinner . Somewhat after one in the afternoon , Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal of being dressed for dinner . He found himself as finely clothed as before , but everything different , everything changed , from his ruff to his stockings . He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious and ornate apartment , where a table was already set for one . Its furniture was all of massy gold , and beautified with designs which well-nigh made it priceless , since they were the work of Benvenuto . The room was half-filled with noble servitors . A chaplain said grace , and Tom was about to fall to , for hunger had long been constitutional with him , but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley , who fastened a napkin about his neck ; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince of Wales was hereditary in this nobleman ’ s family . Tom ’ s cupbearer was present , and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine . The Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also , prepared to taste any suspicious dish upon requirement , and run the risk of being poisoned . He was only an ornamental appendage at this time , and was seldom called upon to exercise his function ; but there had been times , not many generations past , when the office of taster had its perils , and was not a grandeur to be desired . Why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange ; but all the ways of royalty are strange . My Lord d ’ Arcy , First Groom of the Chamber , was there , to do goodness knows what ; but there he was -- let that suffice . The Lord Chief Butler was there , and stood behind Tom ’ s chair , overseeing the solemnities , under command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook , who stood near . Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these ; but they were not all in that room , of course , nor the quarter of them ; neither was Tom aware yet that they existed . All those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head , and to be careful to show no surprise at his vagaries . These ‘ vagaries ’ were soon on exhibition before them ; but they only moved their compassion and their sorrow , not their mirth . It was a heavy affliction to them to see the beloved prince so stricken . Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly ; but no one smiled at it , or even seemed to observe it . He inspected his napkin curiously , and with deep interest , for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric , then said with simplicity -- “ Prithee , take it away , lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled. ” The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner , and without word or protest of any sort . Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest , and asked what they were , and if they were to be eaten ; for it was only recently that men had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing them as luxuries from Holland . { 1 } His question was answered with grave respect , and no surprise manifested . When he had finished his dessert , he filled his pockets with nuts ; but nobody appeared to be aware of it , or disturbed by it . But the next moment he was himself disturbed by it , and showed discomposure ; for this was the only service he had been permitted to do with his own hands during the meal , and he did not doubt that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing . At that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch , and the end of that organ to lift and wrinkle . This continued , and Tom began to evince a growing distress . He looked appealingly , first at one and then another of the lords about him , and tears came into his eyes . They sprang forward with dismay in their faces , and begged to know his trouble . Tom said with genuine anguish -- “ I crave your indulgence : my nose itcheth cruelly . What is the custom and usage in this emergence ? Prithee , speed , for ’ tis but a little time that I can bear it. ” None smiled ; but all were sore perplexed , and looked one to the other in deep tribulation for counsel . But behold , here was a dead wall , and nothing in English history to tell how to get over it . The Master of Ceremonies was not present : there was no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea , or risk the attempt to solve this solemn problem . Alas ! there was no Hereditary Scratcher . Meantime the tears had overflowed their banks , and begun to trickle down Tom ’ s cheeks . His twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief . At last nature broke down the barriers of etiquette : Tom lifted up an inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong , and brought relief to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself . His meal being ended , a lord came and held before him a broad , shallow , golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it , to cleanse his mouth and fingers with ; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin for his use . Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two , then raised it to his lips , and gravely took a draught . Then he returned it to the waiting lord , and said -- “ Nay , it likes me not , my lord : it hath a pretty flavour , but it wanteth strength. ” This new eccentricity of the prince ’ s ruined mind made all the hearts about him ache ; but the sad sight moved none to merriment . Tom ’ s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair , and with uplifted hands , and closed , uplifted eyes , was in the act of beginning the blessing . Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a thing unusual . By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private cabinet , and left there alone to his own devices . Hanging upon hooks in the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel armour , covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in gold . This martial panoply belonged to the true prince -- a recent present from Madam Parr the Queen . Tom put on the greaves , the gauntlets , the plumed helmet , and such other pieces as he could don without assistance , and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter , but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner , and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye him , and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services ; so he restored the pretty things to their several places , and soon was cracking nuts , and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time since God for his sins had made him a prince . When the nuts were all gone , he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet , among them one about the etiquette of the English court . This was a prize . He lay down upon a sumptuous divan , and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal . Let us leave him there for the present . CHAPTER VIII . The Question of the Seal . About five o ’ clock Henry VIII . awoke out of an unrefreshing nap , and muttered to himself , “ Troublous dreams , troublous dreams ! Mine end is now at hand : so say these warnings , and my failing pulses do confirm it. ” Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye , and he muttered , “ Yet will not I die till _He_ go before. ” His attendants perceiving that he was awake , one of them asked his pleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor , who was waiting without . “ Admit him , admit him ! ” exclaimed the King eagerly . The Lord Chancellor entered , and knelt by the King ’ s couch , saying -- “ I have given order , and , according to the King ’ s command , the peers of the realm , in their robes , do now stand at the bar of the House , where , having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk ’ s doom , they humbly wait his majesty ’ s further pleasure in the matter. ” The King ’ s face lit up with a fierce joy . Said he -- “ Lift me up ! In mine own person will I go before my Parliament , and with mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of -- ” His voice failed ; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks ; and the attendants eased him back upon his pillows , and hurriedly assisted him with restoratives . Presently he said sorrowfully -- “ Alack , how have I longed for this sweet hour ! and lo , too late it cometh , and I am robbed of this so coveted chance . But speed ye , speed ye ! let others do this happy office sith ’ tis denied to me . I put my Great Seal in commission : choose thou the lords that shall compose it , and get ye to your work . Speed ye , man ! Before the sun shall rise and set again , bring me his head that I may see it. ” “ According to the King ’ s command , so shall it be . Will ’ t please your majesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me , so that I may forth upon the business ? ” “ The Seal ? Who keepeth the Seal but thou ? ” “ Please your majesty , you did take it from me two days since , saying it should no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon the Duke of Norfolk ’ s warrant. ” “ Why , so in sooth I did : I do remember . . . . What did I with it ? ... I am very feeble . . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the traitor with me . . . . ’ tis strange , strange -- ” The King dropped into inarticulate mumblings , shaking his grey head weakly from time to time , and gropingly trying to recollect what he had done with the Seal . At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and offer information -- “ Sire , if that I may be so bold , here be several that do remember with me how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the Prince of Wales to keep against the day that -- ” “ True , most true ! ” interrupted the King . “ Fetch it ! Go : time flieth ! ” Lord Hertford flew to Tom , but returned to the King before very long , troubled and empty-handed . He delivered himself to this effect -- “ It grieveth me , my lord the King , to bear so heavy and unwelcome tidings ; but it is the will of God that the prince ’ s affliction abideth still , and he can not recall to mind that he received the Seal . So came I quickly to report , thinking it were waste of precious time , and little worth withal , that any should attempt to search the long array of chambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high -- ” A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point . After a little while his majesty said , with a deep sadness in his tone -- “ Trouble him no more , poor child . The hand of God lieth heavy upon him , and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him , and sorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders , and so bring him peace. ” He closed his eyes , fell to mumbling , and presently was silent . After a time he opened his eyes again , and gazed vacantly around until his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor . Instantly his face flushed with wrath -- “ What , thou here yet ! By the glory of God , an ’ thou gettest not about that traitor ’ s business , thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal ! ” The trembling Chancellor answered -- “ Good your Majesty , I cry you mercy ! I but waited for the Seal. ” “ Man , hast lost thy wits ? The small Seal which aforetime I was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury . And , since the Great Seal hath flown away , shall not it suffice ? Hast lost thy wits ? Begone ! And hark ye -- come no more till thou do bring his head. ” The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous vicinity ; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament , and appointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England , the luckless Duke of Norfolk . CHAPTER IX . The river pageant . At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was blazing with light . The river itself , as far as the eye could reach citywards , was so thickly covered with watermen ’ s boats and with pleasure-barges , all fringed with coloured lanterns , and gently agitated by the waves , that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds . The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water , spacious enough to mass the army of a German principality upon , was a picture to see , with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished armour , and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting up and down , and to and fro , in the hurry of preparation . Presently a command was given , and immediately all living creatures vanished from the steps . Now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense and expectancy . As far as one ’ s vision could carry , he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up , and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches , and gaze toward the palace . A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps . They were richly gilt , and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved . Some of them were decorated with banners and streamers ; some with cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms ; others with silken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them , which shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes fluttered them ; others of yet higher pretensions , since they belonged to nobles in the prince ’ s immediate service , had their sides picturesquely fenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings . Each state barge was towed by a tender . Besides the rowers , these tenders carried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate , and a company of musicians . The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great gateway , a troop of halberdiers . ‘ They were dressed in striped hose of black and tawny , velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses , and doublets of murrey and blue cloth , embroidered on the front and back with the three feathers , the prince ’ s blazon , woven in gold . Their halberd staves were covered with crimson velvet , fastened with gilt nails , and ornamented with gold tassels . Filing off on the right and left , they formed two long lines , extending from the gateway of the palace to the water ’ s edge . A thick rayed cloth or carpet was then unfolded , and laid down between them by attendants in the gold-and-crimson liveries of the prince . This done , a flourish of trumpets resounded from within . A lively prelude arose from the musicians on the water ; and two ushers with white wands marched with a slow and stately pace from the portal . They were followed by an officer bearing the civic mace , after whom came another carrying the city ’ s sword ; then several sergeants of the city guard , in their full accoutrements , and with badges on their sleeves ; then the Garter King-at-arms , in his tabard ; then several Knights of the Bath , each with a white lace on his sleeve ; then their esquires ; then the judges , in their robes of scarlet and coifs ; then the Lord High Chancellor of England , in a robe of scarlet , open before , and purfled with minever ; then a deputation of aldermen , in their scarlet cloaks ; and then the heads of the different civic companies , in their robes of state . Now came twelve French gentlemen , in splendid habiliments , consisting of pourpoints of white damask barred with gold , short mantles of crimson velvet lined with violet taffeta , and carnation coloured hauts-de-chausses , and took their way down the steps . They were of the suite of the French ambassador , and were followed by twelve cavaliers of the suite of the Spanish ambassador , clothed in black velvet , unrelieved by any ornament . Following these came several great English nobles with their attendants. ’ There was a flourish of trumpets within ; and the Prince ’ s uncle , the future great Duke of Somerset , emerged from the gateway , arrayed in a ‘ doublet of black cloth-of-gold , and a cloak of crimson satin flowered with gold , and ribanded with nets of silver. ’ He turned , doffed his plumed cap , bent his body in a low reverence , and began to step backward , bowing at each step . A prolonged trumpet-blast followed , and a proclamation , “ Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward , Prince of Wales ! ” High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of flame leapt forth with a thunder-crash ; the massed world on the river burst into a mighty roar of welcome ; and Tom Canty , the cause and hero of it all , stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head . He was ‘ magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin , with a front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue , powdered with diamonds , and edged with ermine . Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold , pounced with the triple-feathered crest , lined with blue satin , set with pearls and precious stones , and fastened with a clasp of brilliants . About his neck hung the order of the Garter , and several princely foreign orders ; ’ and wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash . O Tom Canty , born in a hovel , bred in the gutters of London , familiar with rags and dirt and misery , what a spectacle is this ! CHAPTER X . The Prince in the toils . We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court , with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels . There was but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive , and he was not heeded ; he was hardly even heard , so great was the turmoil . The Prince continued to struggle for freedom , and to rage against the treatment he was suffering , until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him , and raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince ’ s head . The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man ’ s arm , and the blow descended upon his own wrist . Canty roared out -- “ Thou ’ lt meddle , wilt thou ? Then have thy reward. ” His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler ’ s head : there was a groan , a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd , and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone . The mob pressed on , their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode . Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty ’ s abode , with the door closed against the outsiders . By the vague light of a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle , he made out the main features of the loathsome den , and also the occupants of it . Two frowsy girls and a middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner , with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh usage , and expecting and dreading it now . From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes . John Canty said to this one -- “ Tarry ! There ’ s fine mummeries here . Mar them not till thou ’ st enjoyed them : then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt . Stand forth , lad . Now say thy foolery again , an thou ’ st not forgot it . Name thy name . Who art thou ? ” The insulted blood mounted to the little prince ’ s cheek once more , and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man ’ s face and said -- “ ‘ Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak . I tell thee now , as I told thee before , I am Edward , Prince of Wales , and none other. ” The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag ’ s feet to the floor where she stood , and almost took her breath . She stared at the Prince in stupid amazement , which so amused her ruffianly son , that he burst into a roar of laughter . But the effect upon Tom Canty ’ s mother and sisters was different . Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort . They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces , exclaiming -- “ Oh , poor Tom , poor lad ! ” The mother fell on her knees before the Prince , put her hands upon his shoulders , and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears . Then she said -- “ Oh , my poor boy ! Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at last , and ta ’ en thy wit away . Ah ! why did ’ st thou cleave to it when I so warned thee ‘ gainst it ? Thou ’ st broke thy mother ’ s heart. ” The Prince looked into her face , and said gently -- “ Thy son is well , and hath not lost his wits , good dame . Comfort thee : let me to the palace where he is , and straightway will the King my father restore him to thee. ” “ The King thy father ! Oh , my child ! unsay these words that be freighted with death for thee , and ruin for all that be near to thee . Shake of this gruesome dream . Call back thy poor wandering memory . Look upon me . Am not I thy mother that bore thee , and loveth thee ? ” The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said -- “ God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart ; but truly have I never looked upon thy face before. ” The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor , and , covering her eyes with her hands , gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings . “ Let the show go on ! ” shouted Canty . “ What , Nan ! -- what , Bet ! mannerless wenches ! will ye stand in the Prince ’ s presence ? Upon your knees , ye pauper scum , and do him reverence ! ” He followed this with another horse-laugh . The girls began to plead timidly for their brother ; and Nan said -- “ An thou wilt but let him to bed , father , rest and sleep will heal his madness : prithee , do. ” “ Do , father , ” said Bet ; “ he is more worn than is his wont . Show what thou ’ st gathered with thy lazy begging. ” The Prince said -- “ Offend me not with thy sordid matters . I tell thee again I am the King ’ s son. ” A sounding blow upon the Prince ’ s shoulder from Canty ’ s broad palm sent him staggering into goodwife Canty ’ s arms , who clasped him to her breast , and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by interposing her own person . The frightened girls retreated to their corner ; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son . The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty , exclaiming -- “ Thou shalt not suffer for me , madam . Let these swine do their will upon me alone. ” This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about their work without waste of time . Between them they belaboured the boy right soundly , and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim . “ Now , ” said Canty , “ to bed , all of ye . The entertainment has tired me. ” The light was put out , and the family retired . As soon as the snorings of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep , the young girls crept to where the Prince lay , and covered him tenderly from the cold with straw and rags ; and their mother crept to him also , and stroked his hair , and cried over him , whispering broken words of comfort and compassion in his ear the while . She had saved a morsel for him to eat , also ; but the boy ’ s pains had swept away all appetite -- at least for black and tasteless crusts . He was touched by her brave and costly defence of him , and by her commiseration ; and he thanked her in very noble and princely words , and begged her to go to her sleep and try to forget her sorrows . And he added that the King his father would not let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded . This return to his ‘ madness ’ broke her heart anew , and she strained him to her breast again and again , and then went back , drowned in tears , to her bed . As she lay thinking and mourning , the suggestion began to creep into her mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was lacking in Tom Canty , mad or sane . She could not describe it , she could not tell just what it was , and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it . What if the boy were really not her son , after all ? Oh , absurd ! She almost smiled at the idea , spite of her griefs and troubles . No matter , she found that it was an idea that would not ‘ down , ’ but persisted in haunting her . It pursued her , it harassed her , it clung to her , and refused to be put away or ignored . At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove , clearly and without question , whether this lad was her son or not , and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts . Ah , yes , this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty ; therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that test . But it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish . She turned over in her mind one promising test after another , but was obliged to relinquish them all -- none of them were absolutely sure , absolutely perfect ; and an imperfect one could not satisfy her . Evidently she was racking her head in vain -- it seemed manifest that she must give the matter up . While this depressing thought was passing through her mind , her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy , and she knew he had fallen asleep . And while she listened , the measured breathing was broken by a soft , startled cry , such as one utters in a troubled dream . This chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests combined . She at once set herself feverishly , but noiselessly , to work to relight her candle , muttering to herself , “ Had I but seen him _then_ , I should have known ! Since that day , when he was little , that the powder burst in his face , he hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings , but he hath cast his hand before his eyes , even as he did that day ; and not as others would do it , with the palm inward , but always with the palm turned outward -- I have seen it a hundred times , and it hath never varied nor ever failed . Yes , I shall soon know , now ! ” By this time she had crept to the slumbering boy ’ s side , with the candle , shaded , in her hand . She bent heedfully and warily over him , scarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement , and suddenly flashed the light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles . The sleeper ’ s eyes sprang wide open , and he cast a startled stare about him -- but he made no special movement with his hands . The poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief ; but she contrived to hide her emotions , and to soothe the boy to sleep again ; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon the disastrous result of her experiment . She tried to believe that her Tom ’ s madness had banished this habitual gesture of his ; but she could not do it . “ No , ” she said , “ his _hands_ are not mad ; they could not unlearn so old a habit in so brief a time . Hour after hour slipped away , and still he slept like the dead . Thus four or five hours passed . Then his stupor began to lighten . Presently , while half asleep and half awake , he murmured -- “ Sir William ! ” After a moment -- “ Ho , Sir William Herbert ! Hie thee hither , and list to the strangest dream that ever . . . Sir William ! dost hear ? Man , I did think me changed to a pauper , and . . . Ho there ! Guards ! Sir William ! What ! is there no groom of the chamber in waiting ? Alack ! it shall go hard with -- ” “ What aileth thee ? ” asked a whisper near him . “ Who art thou calling ? ” “ Sir William Herbert . Who art thou ? ” “ I ? Who should I be , but thy sister Nan ? Oh , Tom , I had forgot ! Thou ’ rt mad yet -- poor lad , thou ’ rt mad yet : would I had never woke to know it again ! But prithee master thy tongue , lest we be all beaten till we die ! ” The startled Prince sprang partly up , but a sharp reminder from his stiffened bruises brought him to himself , and he sank back among his foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation -- “ Alas ! it was no dream , then ! ” In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished were upon him again , and he realised that he was no longer a petted prince in a palace , with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him , but a pauper , an outcast , clothed in rags , prisoner in a den fit only for beasts , and consorting with beggars and thieves . In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises and shoutings , apparently but a block or two away . The next moment there were several sharp raps at the door ; John Canty ceased from snoring and said -- “ Who knocketh ? What wilt thou ? ” A voice answered -- “ Know ’ st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on ? ” “ No . Neither know I , nor care. ” “ Belike thou ’ lt change thy note eftsoons . An thou would save thy neck , nothing but flight may stead thee . The man is this moment delivering up the ghost . ’ Tis the priest , Father Andrew ! ” “ God-a-mercy ! ” exclaimed Canty . He roused his family , and hoarsely commanded , “ Up with ye all and fly -- or bide where ye are and perish ! ” Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and flying for their lives . John Canty held the Prince by the wrist , and hurried him along the dark way , giving him this caution in a low voice -- “ Mind thy tongue , thou mad fool , and speak not our name . I will choose me a new name , speedily , to throw the law ’ s dogs off the scent . Mind thy tongue , I tell thee ! ” He growled these words to the rest of the family -- “ If it so chance that we be separated , let each make for London Bridge ; whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper ’ s shop on the bridge , let him tarry there till the others be come , then will we flee into Southwark together. ” At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light ; and not only into light , but into the midst of a multitude of singing , dancing , and shouting people , massed together on the river frontage . There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see , up and down the Thames ; London Bridge was illuminated ; Southwark Bridge likewise ; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of coloured lights ; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day ; everywhere were crowds of revellers ; all London seemed to be at large . John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat ; but it was too late . He and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming hive of humanity , and hopelessly separated from each other in an instant . We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe ; Canty still kept his grip upon him . The Prince ’ s heart was beating high with hopes of escape , now . A burly waterman , considerably exalted with liquor , found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd ; he laid his great hand on Canty ’ s shoulder and said -- “ Nay , whither so fast , friend ? Dost canker thy soul with sordid business when all that be leal men and true make holiday ? ” “ Mine affairs are mine own , they concern thee not , ” answered Canty , roughly ; “ take away thy hand and let me pass. ” “ Sith that is thy humour , thou ’ lt _not_ pass , till thou ’ st drunk to the Prince of Wales , I tell thee that , ” said the waterman , barring the way resolutely . “ Give me the cup , then , and make speed , make speed ! ” Other revellers were interested by this time . They cried out -- “ The loving-cup , the loving-cup ! make the sour knave drink the loving-cup , else will we feed him to the fishes. ” So a huge loving-cup was brought ; the waterman , grasping it by one of its handles , and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary napkin , presented it in due and ancient form to Canty , who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the other , according to ancient custom . This left the Prince hand-free for a second , of course . He wasted no time , but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared . In another moment he could not have been harder to find , under that tossing sea of life , if its billows had been the Atlantic ’ s and he a lost sixpence . He very soon realised this fact , and straightway busied himself about his own affairs without further thought of John Canty . He quickly realised another thing , too . To wit , that a spurious Prince of Wales was being feasted by the city in his stead . He easily concluded that the pauper lad , Tom Canty , had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and become a usurper . Therefore there was but one course to pursue -- find his way to the Guildhall , make himself known , and denounce the impostor . He also made up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual preparation , and then be hanged , drawn and quartered , according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high treason . CHAPTER XI . At Guildhall . The royal barge , attended by its gorgeous fleet , took its stately way down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats . The air was laden with music ; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames ; the distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible bonfires ; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky , incrusted with sparkling lights , wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like jewelled lances thrust aloft ; as the fleet swept along , it was greeted from the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and boom of artillery . To Tom Canty , half buried in his silken cushions , these sounds and this spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing . To his little friends at his side , the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey , they were nothing . Arrived at the Dowgate , the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook ( whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under acres of buildings ) to Bucklersbury , past houses and under bridges populous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted , and at last came to a halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard , in the centre of the ancient city of London . Tom disembarked , and he and his gallant procession crossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and Basinghall Street to the Guildhall . Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord Mayor and the Fathers of the City , in their gold chains and scarlet robes of state , and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of the great hall , preceded by heralds making proclamation , and by the Mace and the City Sword . The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom and his two small friends took their places behind their chairs . At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree were seated , with the magnates of the city ; the commoners took places at a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall . From their lofty vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog , the ancient guardians of the city , contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar to it in forgotten generations . There was a bugle-blast and a proclamation , and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall , followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef , smoking hot and ready for the knife . After grace , Tom ( being instructed ) rose -- and the whole house with him -- and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess Elizabeth ; from her it passed to the Lady Jane , and then traversed the general assemblage . So the banquet began . By midnight the revelry was at its height . Now came one of those picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day . A description of it is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it : ‘ Space being made , presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold ; hats on their heads of crimson velvet , with great rolls of gold , girded with two swords , called scimitars , hanging by great bawdricks of gold . Next came yet another baron and another earl , in two long gowns of yellow satin , traversed with white satin , and in every bend of white was a bend of crimson satin , after the fashion of Russia , with furred hats of gray on their heads ; either of them having an hatchet in their hands , and boots with pykes ’ ( points a foot long ) , ’ turned up . And after them came a knight , then the Lord High Admiral , and with him five nobles , in doublets of crimson velvet , voyded low on the back and before to the cannell-bone , laced on the breasts with chains of silver ; and over that , short cloaks of crimson satin , and on their heads hats after the dancers ’ fashion , with pheasants ’ feathers in them . These were appareled after the fashion of Prussia . The torchbearers , which were about an hundred , were appareled in crimson satin and green , like Moors , their faces black . Next came in a mommarye . Then the minstrels , which were disguised , danced ; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also , that it was a pleasure to behold. ’ And while Tom , in his high seat , was gazing upon this ‘ wild ’ dancing , lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented , the ragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and his wrongs , denouncing the impostor , and clamouring for admission at the gates of Guildhall ! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously , and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter . Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him , purposely to goad him into a higher and still more entertaining fury . Tears of mortification sprang to his eyes , but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally . Other taunts followed , added mockings stung him , and he exclaimed -- “ I tell ye again , you pack of unmannerly curs , I am the Prince of Wales ! And all forlorn and friendless as I be , with none to give me word of grace or help me in my need , yet will not I be driven from my ground , but will maintain it ! ” “ Though thou be prince or no prince , ’ tis all one , thou be ’ st a gallant lad , and not friendless neither ! Here stand I by thy side to prove it ; and mind I tell thee thou might ’ st have a worser friend than Miles Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking . Rest thy small jaw , my child ; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very native. ” The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress , aspect , and bearing . He was tall , trim-built , muscular . The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion of jeers and laughter . The next moment a score of voices shouted , “ Kill the dog ! Kill him ! Kill him ! ” and the mob closed in on the warrior , who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a madman . His victims sprawled this way and that , but the mob-tide poured over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished fury . His moments seemed numbered , his destruction certain , when suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded , a voice shouted , “ Way for the King ’ s messenger ! ” and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob , who fled out of harm ’ s reach as fast as their legs could carry them . The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms , and was soon far away from danger and the multitude . Return we within the Guildhall . Suddenly , high above the jubilant roar and thunder of the revel , broke the clear peal of a bugle-note . There was instant silence -- a deep hush ; then a single voice rose -- that of the messenger from the palace -- and began to pipe forth a proclamation , the whole multitude standing listening . The closing words , solemnly pronounced , were -- “ The King is dead ! ” The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one accord ; remained so , in profound silence , a few moments ; then all sank upon their knees in a body , stretched out their hands toward Tom , and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building -- “ Long live the King ! ” Poor Tom ’ s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle , and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him , a moment , then upon the Earl of Hertford . A sudden purpose dawned in his face . He said , in a low tone , at Lord Hertford ’ s ear -- “ Answer me truly , on thy faith and honour ! Uttered I here a command , the which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter , would such commandment be obeyed , and none rise up to say me nay ? ” “ None , my liege , in all these realms . In thy person bides the majesty of England . Thou art the king -- thy word is law. ” Tom responded , in a strong , earnest voice , and with great animation -- “ Then shall the king ’ s law be law of mercy , from this day , and never more be law of blood ! Up from thy knees and away ! To the Tower , and say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die ! ” The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and wide over the hall , and as Hertford hurried from the presence , another prodigious shout burst forth -- “ The reign of blood is ended ! Long live Edward , King of England ! ” CHAPTER XII . The Prince and his Deliverer . As soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob , they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river . Their way was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge ; then they ploughed into the multitude again , Hendon keeping a fast grip upon the Prince ’ s -- no , the King ’ s -- wrist . The tremendous news was already abroad , and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once -- “ The King is dead ! ” The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif , and sent a shudder through his frame . He realised the greatness of his loss , and was filled with a bitter grief ; for the grim tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him . The tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects . For an instant he felt himself the most forlorn , outcast , and forsaken of God ’ s creatures -- then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching thunders : “ Long live King Edward the Sixth ! ” and this made his eyes kindle , and thrilled him with pride to his fingers ’ ends . “ Ah , ” he thought , “ how grand and strange it seems -- _I am King_ ! ” Our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the bridge . This structure , which had stood for six hundred years , and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time , was a curious affair , for a closely packed rank of stores and shops , with family quarters overhead , stretched along both sides of it , from one bank of the river to the other . It looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together -- London and Southwark -- as being well enough as suburbs , but not otherwise particularly important . It was a close corporation , so to speak ; it was a narrow town , of a single street a fifth of a mile long , its population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all his fellow-townsmen intimately , and had known their fathers and mothers before them -- and all their little family affairs into the bargain . It had its aristocracy , of course -- its fine old families of butchers , and bakers , and what-not , who had occupied the same old premises for five or six hundred years , and knew the great history of the Bridge from beginning to end , and all its strange legends ; and who always talked bridgy talk , and thought bridgy thoughts , and lied in a long , level , direct , substantial bridgy way . It was just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and self-conceited . Children were born on the Bridge , were reared there , grew to old age , and finally died without ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge alone . Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable procession which moved through its street night and day , with its confused roar of shouts and cries , its neighings and bellowing and bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp , was the one great thing in this world , and themselves somehow the proprietors of it . And so they were , in effect -- at least they could exhibit it from their windows , and did -- for a consideration -- whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting splendour , for there was no place like it for affording a long , straight , uninterrupted view of marching columns . Men born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and inane elsewhere . History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at the age of seventy-one and retired to the country . But he could only fret and toss in his bed ; he could not go to sleep , the deep stillness was so painful , so awful , so oppressive . When he was worn out with it , at last , he fled back to his old home , a lean and haggard spectre , and fell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge . In the times of which we are writing , the Bridge furnished ‘ object lessons ’ in English history for its children -- namely , the livid and decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its gateways . But we digress . Hendon ’ s lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge . As he neared the door with his small friend , a rough voice said -- “ So , thou ’ rt come at last ! Thou ’ lt not escape again , I warrant thee ; and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat , thou ’ lt not keep us waiting another time , mayhap , ” -- and John Canty put out his hand to seize the boy . Miles Hendon stepped in the way and said -- “ Not too fast , friend . Thou art needlessly rough , methinks . What is the lad to thee ? ” “ If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others ’ affairs , he is my son. ” “ ‘ Tis a lie ! ” cried the little King , hotly . “ Boldly said , and I believe thee , whether thy small headpiece be sound or cracked , my boy . But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father or no , ’ tis all one , he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse , according to his threat , so thou prefer to bide with me. ” “ I do , I do -- I know him not , I loathe him , and will die before I will go with him. ” “ Then ’ tis settled , and there is nought more to say. ” “ We will see , as to that ! ” exclaimed John Canty , striding past Hendon to get at the boy ; “ by force shall he -- ” “ If thou do but touch him , thou animated offal , I will spit thee like a goose ! ” said Hendon , barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword hilt . Canty drew back . So go thy ways , and set quick about it , for I like not much bandying of words , being not over-patient in my nature. ” John Canty moved off , muttering threats and curses , and was swallowed from sight in the crowd . Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his room , with his charge , after ordering a meal to be sent thither . It was a poor apartment , with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in it , and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles . The little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it , almost exhausted with hunger and fatigue . He had been on his feet a good part of a day and a night ( for it was now two or three o ’ clock in the morning ) , and had eaten nothing meantime . He murmured drowsily -- “ Prithee call me when the table is spread , ” and sank into a deep sleep immediately . A smile twinkled in Hendon ’ s eye , and he said to himself -- “ By the mass , the little beggar takes to one ’ s quarters and usurps one ’ s bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them -- with never a by-your-leave or so-please-it-you , or anything of the sort . In his diseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales , and bravely doth he keep up the character . Poor little friendless rat , doubtless his mind has been disordered with ill-usage . Well , I will be his friend ; I have saved him , and it draweth me strongly to him ; already I love the bold-tongued little rascal . How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble and flung back his high defiance ! And what a comely , sweet and gentle face he hath , now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its griefs . I will teach him ; I will cure his malady ; yea , I will be his elder brother , and care for him and watch over him ; and whoso would shame him or do him hurt may order his shroud , for though I be burnt for it he shall need it ! ” He bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying interest , tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the tangled curls with his great brown hand . A slight shiver passed over the boy ’ s form . Hendon muttered -- “ See , now , how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill his body with deadly rheums . Now what shall I do ? ’ twill wake him to take him up and put him within the bed , and he sorely needeth sleep. ” He looked about for extra covering , but finding none , doffed his doublet and wrapped the lad in it , saying , “ I am used to nipping air and scant apparel , ’ tis little I shall mind the cold ! ” -- then walked up and down the room , to keep his blood in motion , soliloquising as before . “ His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales ; ’ twill be odd to have a Prince of Wales still with us , now that he that _was_ the prince is prince no more , but king -- for this poor mind is set upon the one fantasy , and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince and call itself the king . . . If my father liveth still , after these seven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon , he will welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake ; so will my good elder brother , Arthur ; my other brother , Hugh -- but I will crack his crown an _he_ interfere , the fox-hearted , ill-conditioned animal ! Yes , thither will we fare -- and straightway , too. ” A servant entered with a smoking meal , disposed it upon a small deal table , placed the chairs , and took his departure , leaving such cheap lodgers as these to wait upon themselves . The door slammed after him , and the noise woke the boy , who sprang to a sitting posture , and shot a glad glance about him ; then a grieved look came into his face and he murmured to himself , with a deep sigh , “ Alack , it was but a dream , woe is me ! ” Next he noticed Miles Hendon ’ s doublet -- glanced from that to Hendon , comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him , and said , gently -- “ Thou art good to me , yes , thou art very good to me . Take it and put it on -- I shall not need it more. ” Then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood there , waiting . Hendon said in a cheery voice -- “ We ’ ll have a right hearty sup and bite , now , for everything is savoury and smoking hot , and that and thy nap together will make thee a little man again , never fear ! ” The boy made no answer , but bent a steady look , that was filled with grave surprise , and also somewhat touched with impatience , upon the tall knight of the sword . Hendon was puzzled , and said -- “ What ’ s amiss ? ” “ Good sir , I would wash me. ” “ Oh , is that all ? Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou cravest . Make thyself perfectly free here , and welcome , with all that are his belongings. ” Still the boy stood , and moved not ; more , he tapped the floor once or twice with his small impatient foot . Hendon was wholly perplexed . Said he -- “ Bless us , what is it ? ” “ Prithee pour the water , and make not so many words ! ” Hendon , suppressing a horse-laugh , and saying to himself , “ By all the saints , but this is admirable ! ” stepped briskly forward and did the small insolent ’ s bidding ; then stood by , in a sort of stupefaction , until the command , “ Come -- the towel ! ” woke him sharply up . He took up a towel , from under the boy ’ s nose , and handed it to him without comment . He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash , and while he was at it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to . Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity , then drew back the other chair and was about to place himself at table , when the boy said , indignantly -- “ Forbear ! Wouldst sit in the presence of the King ? ” This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations . He muttered to himself , “ Lo , the poor thing ’ s madness is up with the time ! It hath changed with the great change that is come to the realm , and now in fancy is he _king_ ! Good lack , I must humour the conceit , too -- there is no other way -- faith , he would order me to the Tower , else ! ” And pleased with this jest , he removed the chair from the table , took his stand behind the King , and proceeded to wait upon him in the courtliest way he was capable of . While the King ate , the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little , and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk . He said -- “ I think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon , if I heard thee aright ? ” “ Yes , Sire , ” Miles replied ; then observed to himself , “ If I _must_ humour the poor lad ’ s madness , I must ‘ Sire ’ him , I must ‘ Majesty ’ him , I must not go by halves , I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the part I play , else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable and kindly cause. ” The King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine , and said -- “ I would know thee -- tell me thy story . Thou hast a gallant way with thee , and a noble -- art nobly born ? ” “ We are of the tail of the nobility , good your Majesty . My father is a baronet -- one of the smaller lords by knight service { 2 } -- Sir Richard Hendon of Hendon Hall , by Monk ’ s Holm in Kent. ” “ The name has escaped my memory . Go on -- tell me thy story. ” “ ‘ Tis not much , your Majesty , yet perchance it may beguile a short half-hour for want of a better . My father , Sir Richard , is very rich , and of a most generous nature . My mother died whilst I was yet a boy . I have two brothers : Arthur , my elder , with a soul like to his father ’ s ; and Hugh , younger than I , a mean spirit , covetous , treacherous , vicious , underhanded -- a reptile . Such was he from the cradle ; such was he ten years past , when I last saw him -- a ripe rascal at nineteen , I being twenty then , and Arthur twenty-two . There is none other of us but the Lady Edith , my cousin -- she was sixteen then -- beautiful , gentle , good , the daughter of an earl , the last of her race , heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title . My father was her guardian . I loved her and she loved me ; but she was betrothed to Arthur from the cradle , and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be broken . Arthur loved another maid , and bade us be of good cheer and hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give success to our several causes . Hugh loved the Lady Edith ’ s fortune , though in truth he said it was herself he loved -- but then ’ twas his way , alway , to say the one thing and mean the other . But he lost his arts upon the girl ; he could deceive my father , but none else . My father loved him best of us all , and trusted and believed him ; for he was the youngest child , and others hated him -- these qualities being in all ages sufficient to win a parent ’ s dearest love ; and he had a smooth persuasive tongue , with an admirable gift of lying -- and these be qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself . I was wild -- in troth I might go yet farther and say _very_ wild , though ‘ twas a wildness of an innocent sort , since it hurt none but me , brought shame to none , nor loss , nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness , or what might not beseem mine honourable degree . “ Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account -- he seeing that our brother Arthur ’ s health was but indifferent , and hoping the worst might work him profit were I swept out of the path -- so -- but ’ twere a long tale , good my liege , and little worth the telling . Briefly , then , this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them crimes ; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine apartments -- conveyed thither by his own means -- and did convince my father by this , and suborned evidence of servants and other lying knaves , that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in rank defiance of his will . “ Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier and a man of me , my father said , and teach me some degree of wisdom . I fought out my long probation in the continental wars , tasting sumptuously of hard knocks , privation , and adventure ; but in my last battle I was taken captive , and during the seven years that have waxed and waned since then , a foreign dungeon hath harboured me . Through wit and courage I won to the free air at last , and fled hither straight ; and am but just arrived , right poor in purse and raiment , and poorer still in knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall , its people and belongings . So please you , sir , my meagre tale is told. ” “ Thou hast been shamefully abused ! ” said the little King , with a flashing eye . “ But I will right thee -- by the cross will I ! The King hath said it. ” Then , fired by the story of Miles ’ s wrongs , he loosed his tongue and poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his astonished listener . When he had finished , Miles said to himself -- “ Lo , what an imagination he hath ! Verily , this is no common mind ; else , crazed or sane , it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt . Poor ruined little head , it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I bide with the living . He shall never leave my side ; he shall be my pet , my little comrade . And he shall be cured ! -- ay , made whole and sound -- then will he make himself a name -- and proud shall I be to say , ‘ Yes , he is mine -- I took him , a homeless little ragamuffin , but I saw what was in him , and I said his name would be heard some day -- behold him , observe him -- was I right ? ’ ” The King spoke -- in a thoughtful , measured voice -- “ Thou didst save me injury and shame , perchance my life , and so my crown . Such service demandeth rich reward . Name thy desire , and so it be within the compass of my royal power , it is thine. ” This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie . Miles reflected during some moments , then said to himself , “ Yes , that is the thing to do -- by any other means it were impossible to get at it -- and certes , this hour ’ s experience has taught me ’ twould be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as it is . Yes , I will propose it ; ’ twas a happy accident that I did not throw the chance away. ” Then he dropped upon one knee and said -- “ My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject ’ s simple duty , and therefore hath no merit ; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold it worthy some reward , I take heart of grace to make petition to this effect . Near four hundred years ago , as your grace knoweth , there being ill blood betwixt John , King of England , and the King of France , it was decreed that two champions should fight together in the lists , and so settle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God . These two kings , and the Spanish king , being assembled to witness and judge the conflict , the French champion appeared ; but so redoubtable was he , that our English knights refused to measure weapons with him . So the matter , which was a weighty one , was like to go against the English monarch by default . Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy , the mightiest arm in England , stripped of his honours and possessions , and wasting with long captivity . Appeal was made to him ; he gave assent , and came forth arrayed for battle ; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge frame and hear his famous name but he fled away , and the French king ’ s cause was lost . King John restored De Courcy ’ s titles and possessions , and said , ‘ Name thy wish and thou shalt have it , though it cost me half my kingdom ; ’ whereat De Courcy , kneeling , as I do now , made answer , ‘ This , then , I ask , my liege ; that I and my successors may have and hold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of England , henceforth while the throne shall last. ’ The boon was granted , as your Majesty knoweth ; and there hath been no time , these four hundred years , that that line has failed of an heir ; and so , even unto this day , the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the King ’ s Majesty , without let or hindrance , and this none other may do . { 3 } Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer , I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and privilege -- to my more than sufficient reward -- and none other , to wit : that I and my heirs , for ever , may _sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England ! ” “ Rise , Sir Miles Hendon , Knight , ” said the King , gravely -- giving the accolade with Hendon ’ s sword -- “ rise , and seat thyself . Thy petition is granted . Whilst England remains , and the crown continues , the privilege shall not lapse. ” His Majesty walked apart , musing , and Hendon dropped into a chair at table , observing to himself , “ ‘ Twas a brave thought , and hath wrought me a mighty deliverance ; my legs are grievously wearied . An I had not thought of that , I must have had to stand for weeks , till my poor lad ’ s wits are cured. ” After a little , he went on , “ And so I am become a knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows ! A most odd and strange position , truly , for one so matter-of-fact as I. I will not laugh -- no , God forbid , for this thing which is so substanceless to me is _real_ to him . And to me , also , in one way , it is not a falsity , for it reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him. ” After a pause : “ Ah , what if he should call me by my fine title before folk ! -- there ’ d be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment ! But no matter , let him call me what he will , so it please him ; I shall be content. ” CHAPTER XIII . The disappearance of the Prince . A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades . The King said -- “ Remove these rags. ” -- meaning his clothing . He said , sleepily -- “ Thou wilt sleep athwart the door , and guard it. ” In a moment more he was out of his troubles , in a deep slumber . “ Dear heart , he should have been born a king ! ” muttered Hendon , admiringly ; “ he playeth the part to a marvel. ” Then he stretched himself across the door , on the floor , saying contentedly -- “ I have lodged worse for seven years ; ’ twould be but ill gratitude to Him above to find fault with this. ” He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared . Toward noon he rose , uncovered his unconscious ward -- a section at a time -- and took his measure with a string . The King awoke , just as he had completed his work , complained of the cold , and asked what he was doing . “ ‘ Tis done , now , my liege , ” said Hendon ; “ I have a bit of business outside , but will presently return ; sleep thou again -- thou needest it . There -- let me cover thy head also -- thou ’ lt be warm the sooner. ” The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended . Miles slipped softly out , and slipped as softly in again , in the course of thirty or forty minutes , with a complete second-hand suit of boy ’ s clothing , of cheap material , and showing signs of wear ; but tidy , and suited to the season of the year . He seated himself , and began to overhaul his purchase , mumbling to himself -- “ A longer purse would have got a better sort , but when one has not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may do -- “ ‘ There was a woman in our town , In our town did dwell -- ’ “ He stirred , methinks -- I must sing in a less thunderous key ; ’ tis not good to mar his sleep , with this journey before him , and he so wearied out , poor chap . . . This garment -- ‘ tis well enough -- a stitch here and another one there will set it aright . This other is better , albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it , likewise . . . _These_ be very good and sound , and will keep his small feet warm and dry -- an odd new thing to him , belike , since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare , winters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread , seeing one getteth a year ’ s sufficiency for a farthing , and such a brave big needle without cost , for mere love . Now shall I have the demon ’ s own time to thread it ! ” And so he had . He did as men have always done , and probably always will do , to the end of time -- held the needle still , and tried to thrust the thread through the eye , which is the opposite of a woman ’ s way . He succeeded at last , and took up the garment that had lain waiting , meantime , across his lap , and began his work . “ The inn is paid -- the breakfast that is to come , included -- and there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at Hendon Hall -- “ ‘ She loved her hus -- ’ “ Body o ’ me ! I have driven the needle under my nail ! . . . It matters little -- ‘ tis not a novelty -- yet ’ tis not a convenience , neither . . . . We shall be merry there , little one , never doubt it ! Thy troubles will vanish there , and likewise thy sad distemper -- “ ‘ She loved her husband dearilee , But another man -- ’ “ These be noble large stitches ! ” -- holding the garment up and viewing it admiringly -- “ they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and plebeian -- “ ‘ She loved her husband dearilee , But another man he loved she , -- ’ “ Marry , ’ tis done -- a goodly piece of work , too , and wrought with expedition . Now will I wake him , apparel him , pour for him , feed him , and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark and -- be pleased to rise , my liege ! -- he answereth not -- what ho , my liege ! -- of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch , sith his slumber is deaf to speech . What ! ” He threw back the covers -- the boy was gone ! He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment ; noticed for the first time that his ward ’ s ragged raiment was also missing ; then he began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper . At that moment a servant entered with the breakfast . “ Explain , thou limb of Satan , or thy time is come ! ” roared the man of war , and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue , for the instant , for fright and surprise . “ Where is the boy ? ” In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information desired . “ You were hardly gone from the place , your worship , when a youth came running and said it was your worship ’ s will that the boy come to you straight , at the bridge-end on the Southwark side . I brought him hither ; and when he woke the lad and gave his message , the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed ‘ so early , ’ as he called it , but straightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth , only saying it had been better manners that your worship came yourself , not sent a stranger -- and so -- ” “ And so thou ’ rt a fool ! -- a fool and easily cozened -- hang all thy breed ! Yet mayhap no hurt is done . Possibly no harm is meant the boy . I will go fetch him . Make the table ready . Stay ! the coverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them -- happened that by accident ? ” “ I know not , good your worship . I saw the youth meddle with them -- he that came for the boy. ” “ Thousand deaths ! ‘ Twas done to deceive me -- ‘ tis plain ’ twas done to gain time . Hark ye ! Was that youth alone ? ” “ All alone , your worship. ” “ Art sure ? ” “ Sure , your worship. ” “ Collect thy scattered wits -- bethink thee -- take time , man. ” After a moment ’ s thought , the servant said -- “ When he came , none came with him ; but now I remember me that as the two stepped into the throng of the Bridge , a ruffian-looking man plunged out from some near place ; and just as he was joining them -- ” “ What _then_ ? -- out with it ! ” thundered the impatient Hendon , interrupting . “ Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in , and I saw no more , being called by my master , who was in a rage because a joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot , though I take all the saints to witness that to blame _me_ for that miscarriage were like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com -- ” “ Out of my sight , idiot ! Thy prating drives me mad ! Hold ! Whither art flying ? Canst not bide still an instant ? Went they toward Southwark ? ” “ Even so , your worship -- for , as I said before , as to that detestable joint , the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than -- ” “ Art here _yet_ ! And prating still ! Vanish , lest I throttle thee ! ” The servitor vanished . Hendon followed after him , passed him , and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride , muttering , “ ‘ Tis that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son . I have lost thee , my poor little mad master -- it is a bitter thought -- and I had come to love thee so ! No ! by book and bell , _not_ lost ! Not lost , for I will ransack the land till I find thee again . Poor child , yonder is his breakfast -- and mine , but I have no hunger now ; so , let the rats have it -- speed , speed ! that is the word ! ” As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the Bridge he several times said to himself -- clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly pleasing one -- “ He grumbled , but he _went_ -- he went , yes , because he thought Miles Hendon asked it , sweet lad -- he would ne ’ er have done it for another , I know it well. ” CHAPTER XIV . ‘ Le Roi est mort -- vive le Roi. ’ Toward daylight of the same morning , Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened his eyes in the dark . He lay silent a few moments , trying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions , and get some sort of meaning out of them ; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous but guarded voice -- “ I see it all , I see it all ! Now God be thanked , I am indeed awake at last ! Come , joy ! vanish , sorrow ! Ho , Nan ! Bet ! kick off your straw and hie ye hither to my side , till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the wildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to astonish the soul of man withal ! . . . Ho , Nan , I say ! Bet ! ” A dim form appeared at his side , and a voice said -- “ Wilt deign to deliver thy commands ? ” “ Commands ? . . . O , woe is me , I know thy voice ! Speak thou -- who am I ? ” “ Thou ? In sooth , yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales ; to-day art thou my most gracious liege , Edward , King of England. ” Tom buried his head among his pillows , murmuring plaintively -- “ Alack , it was no dream ! Go to thy rest , sweet sir -- leave me to my sorrows. ” Tom slept again , and after a time he had this pleasant dream . He thought it was summer , and he was playing , all alone , in the fair meadow called Goodman ’ s Fields , when a dwarf only a foot high , with long red whiskers and a humped back , appeared to him suddenly and said , “ Dig by that stump. ” He did so , and found twelve bright new pennies -- wonderful riches ! Yet this was not the best of it ; for the dwarf said -- “ I know thee . Thou art a good lad , and a deserving ; thy distresses shall end , for the day of thy reward is come . Dig here every seventh day , and thou shalt find always the same treasure , twelve bright new pennies . Tell none -- keep the secret. ” Then the dwarf vanished , and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize , saying to himself , “ Every night will I give my father a penny ; he will think I begged it , it will glad his heart , and I shall no more be beaten . One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall have ; mother , Nan , and Bet the other four . We be done with hunger and rags , now , done with fears and frets and savage usage. ” In his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath , but with eyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm ; cast four of his pennies into his mother ’ s lap and cried out -- “ They are for thee ! -- all of them , every one ! -- for thee and Nan and Bet -- and honestly come by , not begged nor stolen ! ” The happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and exclaimed -- “ It waxeth late -- may it please your Majesty to rise ? ” Ah ! that was not the answer he was expecting . The dream had snapped asunder -- he was awake . He opened his eyes -- the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was kneeling by his couch . The gladness of the lying dream faded away -- the poor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king . The room was filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles -- the mourning colour -- and with noble servants of the monarch . Tom sat up in bed and gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company . The weighty business of dressing began , and one courtier after another knelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences upon his heavy loss , whilst the dressing proceeded . In the beginning , a shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting , who passed it to the First Lord of the Buckhounds , who passed it to the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber , who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest , who passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole , who passed it to the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster , who passed it to the Master of the Wardrobe , who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms , who passed it to the Constable of the Tower , who passed it to the Chief Steward of the Household , who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer , who passed it to the Lord High Admiral of England , who passed it to the Archbishop of Canterbury , who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber , who took what was left of it and put it on Tom . Poor little wondering chap , it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire . Each garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process ; consequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony ; so weary that he felt an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose begin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter was drawing near . But he exulted too soon . The First Lord of the Bedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom ’ s legs in them , when a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things back into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded look and a whispered , “ See , my lord ! ” pointing to a something connected with the hose . The Archbishop paled , then flushed , and passed the hose to the Lord High Admiral , whispering , “ See , my lord ! ” The Admiral passed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer , and had hardly breath enough in his body to ejaculate , “ See , my lord ! ” The hose drifted backward along the line , to the Chief Steward of the Household , the Constable of the Tower , Norroy King-at-Arms , the Master of the Wardrobe , the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster , the Third Groom of the Stole , the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest , the Second Gentleman of the Bedchamber , the First Lord of the Buckhounds , -- accompanied always with that amazed and frightened “ See ! see ! ” -- till they finally reached the hands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting , who gazed a moment , with a pallid face , upon what had caused all this dismay , then hoarsely",The Prince And The Pauper

WHO STEADFAST FRIENDSHIP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THESE PAGES PART I -- THE DAMSEL CHAPTER ONE -- YOUNG POWELL AND HIS CHANCE I believe he had seen us out of the window coming off to dine in the dinghy of a fourteen-ton yawl belonging to Marlow my host and skipper . We helped the boy we had with us to haul the boat up on the landing-stage before we went up to the riverside inn , where we found our new acquaintance eating his dinner in dignified loneliness at the head of a long table , white and inhospitable like a snow bank . The red tint of his clear-cut face with trim short black whiskers under a cap of curly iron-grey hair was the only warm spot in the dinginess of that room cooled by the cheerless tablecloth . We knew him already by sight as the owner of a little five-ton cutter , which he sailed alone apparently , a fellow yachtsman in the unpretending band of fanatics who cruise at the mouth of the Thames . But the first time he addressed the waiter sharply as 'steward ' we knew him at once for a sailor as well as a yachtsman . Presently he had occasion to reprove that same waiter for the slovenly manner in which the dinner was served . He did it with considerable energy and then turned to us . `` If we at sea , '' he declared , `` went about our work as people ashore high and low go about theirs we should never make a living . No one would employ us . And moreover no ship navigated and sailed in the happy-go- lucky manner people conduct their business on shore would ever arrive into port . '' Since he had retired from the sea he had been astonished to discover that the educated people were not much better than the others . No one seemed to take any proper pride in his work : from plumbers who were simply thieves to , say , newspaper men ( he seemed to think them a specially intellectual class ) who never by any chance gave a correct version of the simplest affair . This universal inefficiency of what he called `` the shore gang '' he ascribed in general to the want of responsibility and to a sense of security . `` They see , '' he went on , `` that no matter what they do this tight little island wo n't turn turtle with them or spring a leak and go to the bottom with their wives and children . '' From this point the conversation took a special turn relating exclusively to sea-life . On that subject he got quickly in touch with Marlow who in his time had followed the sea . They kept up a lively exchange of reminiscences while I listened . They agreed that the happiest time in their lives was as youngsters in good ships , with no care in the world but not to lose a watch below when at sea and not a moment 's time in going ashore after work hours when in harbour . They agreed also as to the proudest moment they had known in that calling which is never embraced on rational and practical grounds , because of the glamour of its romantic associations . It was the moment when they had passed successfully their first examination and left the seamanship Examiner with the little precious slip of blue paper in their hands . `` That day I would n't have called the Queen my cousin , '' declared our new acquaintance enthusiastically . At that time the Marine Board examinations took place at the St. Katherine 's Dock House on Tower Hill , and he informed us that he had a special affection for the view of that historic locality , with the Gardens to the left , the front of the Mint to the right , the miserable tumble-down little houses farther away , a cabstand , boot-blacks squatting on the edge of the pavement and a pair of big policemen gazing with an air of superiority at the doors of the Black Horse public-house across the road . This was the part of the world , he said , his eyes first took notice of , on the finest day of his life . He had emerged from the main entrance of St. Katherine 's Dock House a full-fledged second mate after the hottest time of his life with Captain R- , the most dreaded of the three seamanship Examiners who at the time were responsible for the merchant service officers qualifying in the Port of London . `` We all who were preparing to pass , '' he said , `` used to shake in our shoes at the idea of going before him . He kept me for an hour and a half in the torture chamber and behaved as though he hated me . He kept his eyes shaded with one of his hands . Suddenly he let it drop saying , `` You will do ! '' Before I realised what he meant he was pushing the blue slip across the table . I jumped up as if my chair had caught fire . `` Thank you , sir , '' says I , grabbing the paper . `` Good morning , good luck to you , '' he growls at me . `` The old doorkeeper fussed out of the cloak-room with my hat . They always do . But he looked very hard at me before he ventured to ask in a sort of timid whisper : `` Got through all right , sir ? '' For all answer I dropped a half-crown into his soft broad palm . `` Well , '' says he with a sudden grin from ear to ear , `` I never knew him keep any of you gentlemen so long . He failed two second mates this morning before your turn came . Less than twenty minutes each : that 's about his usual time . '' `` I found myself downstairs without being aware of the steps as if I had floated down the staircase . The finest day in my life . The day you get your first command is nothing to it . For one thing a man is not so young then and for another with us , you know , there is nothing much more to expect . Yes , the finest day of one 's life , no doubt , but then it is just a day and no more . What comes after is about the most unpleasant time for a youngster , the trying to get an officer 's berth with nothing much to show but a brand-new certificate . It is surprising how useless you find that piece of ass 's skin that you have been putting yourself in such a state about . It did n't strike me at the time that a Board of Trade certificate does not make an officer , not by a long long way . But the slippers of the ships I was haunting with demands for a job knew that very well . I do n't wonder at them now , and I do n't blame them either . But this 'trying to get a ship ' is pretty hard on a youngster all the same . . . `` He went on then to tell us how tired he was and how discouraged by this lesson of disillusion following swiftly upon the finest day of his life . He told us how he went the round of all the ship-owners ' offices in the City where some junior clerk would furnish him with printed forms of application which he took home to fill up in the evening . He used to run out just before midnight to post them in the nearest pillar-box . And that was all that ever came of it . In his own words : he might just as well have dropped them all properly addressed and stamped into the sewer grating . Then one day , as he was wending his weary way to the docks , he met a friend and former shipmate a little older than himself outside the Fenchurch Street Railway Station . He craved for sympathy but his friend had just `` got a ship '' that very morning and was hurrying home in a state of outward joy and inward uneasiness usual to a sailor who after many days of waiting suddenly gets a berth . This friend had the time to condole with him but briefly . He must be moving . Then as he was running off , over his shoulder as it were , he suggested : `` Why do n't you go and speak to Mr. Powell in the Shipping Office . '' Our friend objected that he did not know Mr. Powell from Adam . And the other already pretty near round the corner shouted back advice : `` Go to the private door of the Shipping Office and walk right up to him . His desk is by the window . Go up boldly and say I sent you . '' Our new acquaintance looking from one to the other of us declared : `` Upon my word , I had grown so desperate that I 'd have gone boldly up to the devil himself on the mere hint that he had a second mate 's job to give away . '' It was at this point that interrupting his flow of talk to light his pipe but holding us with his eye he inquired whether we had known Powell . Marlow with a slight reminiscent smile murmured that he `` remembered him very well . '' Then there was a pause . Our new acquaintance had become involved in a vexatious difficulty with his pipe which had suddenly betrayed his trust and disappointed his anticipation of self-indulgence . To keep the ball rolling I asked Marlow if this Powell was remarkable in any way . `` He was not exactly remarkable , '' Marlow answered with his usual nonchalance . `` In a general way it 's very difficult for one to become remarkable . People wo n't take sufficient notice of one , do n't you know . I remember Powell so well simply because as one of the Shipping Masters in the Port of London he dispatched me to sea on several long stages of my sailor 's pilgrimage . He resembled Socrates . I mean he resembled him genuinely : that is in the face . A philosophical mind is but an accident . He reproduced exactly the familiar bust of the immortal sage , if you will imagine the bust with a high top hat riding far on the back of the head , and a black coat over the shoulders . As I never saw him except from the other side of the long official counter bearing the five writing desks of the five Shipping Masters , Mr. Powell has remained a bust to me . '' Our new acquaintance advanced now from the mantelpiece with his pipe in good working order . `` What was the most remarkable about Powell , '' he enunciated dogmatically with his head in a cloud of smoke , `` is that he should have had just that name . You see , my name happens to be Powell too . '' It was clear that this intelligence was not imparted to us for social purposes . It required no acknowledgment . We continued to gaze at him with expectant eyes . He gave himself up to the vigorous enjoyment of his pipe for a silent minute or two . Then picking up the thread of his story he told us how he had started hot foot for Tower Hill . He had not been that way since the day of his examination -- the finest day of his life -- the day of his overweening pride . It was very different now . He would not have called the Queen his cousin , still , but this time it was from a sense of profound abasement . He did n't think himself good enough for anybody's kinship . He envied the purple-nosed old cab-drivers on the stand , the boot-black boys at the edge of the pavement , the two large bobbies pacing slowly along the Tower Gardens railings in the consciousness of their infallible might , and the bright scarlet sentries walking smartly to and fro before the Mint . He envied them their places in the scheme of world 's labour . And he envied also the miserable sallow , thin-faced loafers blinking their obscene eyes and rubbing their greasy shoulders against the door-jambs of the Black Horse pub , because they were too far gone to feel their degradation . I must render the man the justice that he conveyed very well to us the sense of his youthful hopelessness surprised at not finding its place in the sun and no recognition of its right to live . He went up the outer steps of St. Katherine 's Dock House , the very steps from which he had some six weeks before surveyed the cabstand , the buildings , the policemen , the boot-blacks , the paint , gilt , and plateglass of the Black Horse , with the eye of a Conqueror . At the time he had been at the bottom of his heart surprised that all this had not greeted him with songs and incense , but now ( he made no secret of it ) he made his entry in a slinking fashion past the doorkeeper 's glass box . `` I had n't any half-crowns to spare for tips , '' he remarked grimly . The man , however , ran out after him asking : `` What do you require ? '' but with a grateful glance up at the first floor in remembrance of Captain R-'s examination room ( how easy and delightful all that had been ) he bolted down a flight leading to the basement and found himself in a place of dusk and mystery and many doors . He had been afraid of being stopped by some rule of no-admittance . However he was not pursued . The basement of St. Katherine 's Dock House is vast in extent and confusing in its plan . Pale shafts of light slant from above into the gloom of its chilly passages . Powell wandered up and down there like an early Christian refugee in the catacombs ; but what little faith he had in the success of his enterprise was oozing out at his finger-tips . At a dark turn under a gas bracket whose flame was half turned down his self- confidence abandoned him altogether . `` I stood there to think a little , '' he said . `` A foolish thing to do because of course I got scared . What could you expect ? It takes some nerve to tackle a stranger with a request for a favour . I wished my namesake Powell had been the devil himself . I felt somehow it would have been an easier job . You see , I never believed in the devil enough to be scared of him ; but a man can make himself very unpleasant . I looked at a lot of doors , all shut tight , with a growing conviction that I would never have the pluck to open one of them . Thinking 's no good for one's nerve . I concluded I would give up the whole business . But I didn't give up in the end , and I 'll tell you what stopped me . It was the recollection of that confounded doorkeeper who had called after me . I felt sure the fellow would be on the look-out at the head of the stairs . If he asked me what I had been after , as he had the right to do , I would n't know what to answer that would n't make me look silly if no worse . I got very hot . There was no chance of slinking out of this business . `` I had lost my bearings somehow down there . Of the many doors of various sizes , right and left , a good few had glazed lights above ; some however must have led merely into lumber rooms or such like , because when I brought myself to try one or two I was disconcerted to find that they were locked . I stood there irresolute and uneasy like a baffled thief . The confounded basement was as still as a grave and I became aware of my heart beats . Very uncomfortable sensation . Never happened to me before or since . A bigger door to the left of me , with a large brass handle looked as if it might lead into the Shipping Office . I tried it , setting my teeth . `` Here goes ! '' `` It came open quite easily . And lo ! the place it opened into was hardly any bigger than a cupboard . Anyhow it was n't more than ten feet by twelve ; and as I in a way expected to see the big shadowy cellar-like extent of the Shipping Office where I had been once or twice before , I was extremely startled . A gas bracket hung from the middle of the ceiling over a dark , shabby writing-desk covered with a litter of yellowish dusty documents . Under the flame of the single burner which made the place ablaze with light , a plump , little man was writing hard , his nose very near the desk . His head was perfectly bald and about the same drab tint as the papers . He appeared pretty dusty too . `` I did n't notice whether there were any cobwebs on him , but I shouldn't wonder if there were because he looked as though he had been imprisoned for years in that little hole . The way he dropped his pen and sat blinking my way upset me very much . And his dungeon was hot and musty ; it smelt of gas and mushrooms , and seemed to be somewhere 120 feet below the ground . Solid , heavy stacks of paper filled all the corners half-way up to the ceiling . And when the thought flashed upon me that these were the premises of the Marine Board and that this fellow must be connected in some way with ships and sailors and the sea , my astonishment took my breath away . One could n't imagine why the Marine Board should keep that bald , fat creature slaving down there . For some reason or other I felt sorry and ashamed to have found him out in his wretched captivity . I asked gently and sorrowfully : `` The Shipping Office , please . '' He piped up in a contemptuous squeaky voice which made me start : `` Not here . Try the passage on the other side . Street side . This is the Dock side . You 've lost your way . . . `` He spoke in such a spiteful tone that I thought he was going to round off with the words : `` You fool '' . . . and perhaps he meant to . But what he finished sharply with was : `` Shut the door quietly after you . '' And I did shut it quietly -- you bet . Quick and quiet . The indomitable spirit of that chap impressed me . I wonder sometimes whether he has succeeded in writing himself into liberty and a pension at last , or had to go out of his gas-lighted grave straight into that other dark one where nobody would want to intrude . My humanity was pleased to discover he had so much kick left in him , but I was not comforted in the least . It occurred to me that if Mr. Powell had the same sort of temper . . . However , I did n't give myself time to think and scuttled across the space at the foot of the stairs into the passage where I 'd been told to try . And I tried the first door I came to , right away , without any hanging back , because coming loudly from the hall above an amazed and scandalized voice wanted to know what sort of game I was up to down there . `` Don't you know there 's no admittance that way ? '' it roared . But if there was anything more I shut it out of my hearing by means of a door marked _Private_ on the outside . It let me into a six-feet wide strip between a long counter and the wall , taken off a spacious , vaulted room with a grated window and a glazed door giving daylight to the further end . The first thing I saw right in front of me were three middle-aged men having a sort of romp together round about another fellow with a thin , long neck and sloping shoulders who stood up at a desk writing on a large sheet of paper and taking no notice except that he grinned quietly to himself . They turned very sour at once when they saw me . I heard one of them mutter 'Hullo ! What have we here ? ' `` ' I want to see Mr. Powell , please , ' I said , very civil but firm ; I would let nothing scare me away now . This was the Shipping Office right enough . It was after 3 o'clock and the business seemed over for the day with them . The long-necked fellow went on with his writing steadily . I observed that he was no longer grinning . The three others tossed their heads all together towards the far end of the room where a fifth man had been looking on at their antics from a high stool . I walked up to him as boldly as if he had been the devil himself . With one foot raised up and resting on the cross-bar of his seat he never stopped swinging the other which was well clear of the stone floor . He had unbuttoned the top of his waistcoat and he wore his tall hat very far at the back of his head . He had a full unwrinkled face and such clear-shining eyes that his grey beard looked quite false on him , stuck on for a disguise . You said just now he resembled Socrates -- did n't you ? I do n't know about that . This Socrates was a wise man , I believe ? '' `` He was , '' assented Marlow . `` And a true friend of youth . He lectured them in a peculiarly exasperating manner . It was a way he had . '' `` Then give me Powell every time , '' declared our new acquaintance sturdily . `` He did n't lecture me in any way . Not he . He said : 'How do you do ? ' quite kindly to my mumble . Then says he looking very hard at me : ' I do n't think I know you -- do I ? ' `` No , sir , '' I said and down went my heart sliding into my boots , just as the time had come to summon up all my cheek . There 's nothing meaner in the world than a piece of impudence that is n't carried off well . For fear of appearing shamefaced I started about it so free and easy as almost to frighten myself . He listened for a while looking at my face with surprise and curiosity and then held up his hand . I was glad enough to shut up , I can tell you . `` Well , you are a cool hand , '' says he . `` And that friend of yours too . He pestered me coming here every day for a fortnight till a captain I'm acquainted with was good enough to give him a berth . And no sooner he's provided for than he turns you on . You youngsters do n't seem to mind whom you get into trouble . '' `` It was my turn now to stare with surprise and curiosity . He had n't been talking loud but he lowered his voice still more . `` Do n't you know it 's illegal ? '' `` I wondered what he was driving at till I remembered that procuring a berth for a sailor is a penal offence under the Act . That clause was directed of course against the swindling practices of the boarding-house crimps . It had never struck me it would apply to everybody alike no matter what the motive , because I believed then that people on shore did their work with care and foresight . `` I was confounded at the idea , but Mr. Powell made me soon see that an Act of Parliament has n't any sense of its own . It has only the sense that 's put into it ; and that 's precious little sometimes . He did n't mind helping a young man to a ship now and then , he said , but if we kept on coming constantly it would soon get about that he was doing it for money . `` A pretty thing that would be : the Senior Shipping-Master of the Port of London hauled up in a police court and fined fifty pounds , '' says he . `` I 've another four years to serve to get my pension . It could be made to look very black against me and do n't you make any mistake about it , '' he says . `` And all the time with one knee well up he went on swinging his other leg like a boy on a gate and looking at me very straight with his shining eyes . I was confounded I tell you . It made me sick to hear him imply that somebody would make a report against him . `` Oh ! '' I asked shocked , `` who would think of such a scurvy trick , sir ? '' I was half disgusted with him for having the mere notion of it . `` Who ? '' says he , speaking very low . `` Anybody . One of the office messengers maybe . I 've risen to be the Senior of this office and we are all very good friends here , but do n't you think that my colleague that sits next to me would n't like to go up to this desk by the window four years in advance of the regulation time ? Or even one year for that matter . It 's human nature . '' `` I could not help turning my head . The three fellows who had been skylarking when I came in were now talking together very soberly , and the long-necked chap was going on with his writing still . He seemed to me the most dangerous of the lot . I saw him sideface and his lips were set very tight . I had never looked at mankind in that light before . When one 's young human nature shocks one . But what startled me most was to see the door I had come through open slowly and give passage to a head in a uniform cap with a Board of Trade badge . It was that blamed old doorkeeper from the hall . He had run me to earth and meant to dig me out too . He walked up the office smirking craftily , cap in hand . `` What is it , Symons ? '' asked Mr. Powell . `` I was only wondering where this 'ere gentleman 'ad gone to , sir . He slipped past me upstairs , sir . '' I felt mighty uncomfortable . `` That 's all right , Symons . I know the gentleman , '' says Mr. Powell as serious as a judge . `` Very well , sir . Of course , sir . I saw the gentleman running races all by 'isself down 'ere , so I . . . '' `` It 's all right I tell you , '' Mr. Powell cut him short with a wave of his hand ; and , as the old fraud walked off at last , he raised his eyes to me . I did not know what to do : stay there , or clear out , or say that I was sorry . `` Let 's see , '' says he , `` what did you tell me your name was ? '' `` Now , observe , I had n't given him my name at all and his question embarrassed me a bit . Somehow or other it did n't seem proper for me to fling his own name at him as it were . So I merely pulled out my new certificate from my pocket and put it into his hand unfolded , so that he could read _Charles Powell_ written very plain on the parchment . `` He dropped his eyes on to it and after a while laid it quietly on the desk by his side . I did n't know whether he meant to make any remark on this coincidence . Before he had time to say anything the glass door came open with a bang and a tall , active man rushed in with great strides . His face looked very red below his high silk hat . You could see at once he was the skipper of a big ship . `` Mr. Powell after telling me in an undertone to wait a little addressed him in a friendly way . `` I 've been expecting you in every moment to fetch away your Articles , Captain . Here they are all ready for you . '' And turning to a pile of agreements lying at his elbow he took up the topmost of them . From where I stood I could read the words : `` Ship _Ferndale_ '' written in a large round hand on the first page . `` No , Mr. Powell , they are n't ready , worse luck , '' says that skipper . `` I've got to ask you to strike out my second officer . '' He seemed excited and bothered . He explained that his second mate had been working on board all the morning . At one o'clock he went out to get a bit of dinner and did n't turn up at two as he ought to have done . Instead there came a messenger from the hospital with a note signed by a doctor . Collar bone and one arm broken . Let himself be knocked down by a pair horse van while crossing the road outside the dock gate , as if he had neither eyes nor ears . And the ship ready to leave the dock at six o'clock to-morrow morning ! `` Mr. Powell dipped his pen and began to turn the leaves of the agreement over . `` We must then take his name off , '' he says in a kind of unconcerned sing-song . `` What am I to do ? '' burst out the skipper . `` This office closes at four o'clock . I ca n't find a man in half an hour . '' `` This office closes at four , '' repeats Mr. Powell glancing up and down the pages and touching up a letter here and there with perfect indifference . `` Even if I managed to lay hold some time to-day of a man ready to go at such short notice I could n't ship him regularly here -- could I ? '' `` Mr. Powell was busy drawing his pen through the entries relating to that unlucky second mate and making a note in the margin . `` You could sign him on yourself on board , '' says he without looking up . `` But I do n't think you 'll find easily an officer for such a pier-head jump . '' `` Upon this the fine-looking skipper gave signs of distress . The ship must n't miss the next morning 's tide . He had to take on board forty tons of dynamite and a hundred and twenty tons of gunpowder at a place down the river before proceeding to sea . It was all arranged for next day . There would be no end of fuss and complications if the ship did n't turn up in time . . . I could n't help hearing all this , while wishing him to take himself off , because I wanted to know why Mr. Powell had told me to wait . After what he had been saying there did n't seem any object in my hanging about . If I had had my certificate in my pocket I should have tried to slip away quietly ; but Mr. Powell had turned about into the same position I found him in at first and was again swinging his leg . My certificate open on the desk was under his left elbow and I could n't very well go up and jerk it away . `` I do n't know , '' says he carelessly , addressing the helpless captain but looking fixedly at me with an expression as if I had n't been there . `` I do n't know whether I ought to tell you that I know of a disengaged second mate at hand . '' `` Do you mean you 've got him here ? '' shouts the other looking all over the empty public part of the office as if he were ready to fling himself bodily upon anything resembling a second mate . He had been so full of his difficulty that I verify believe he had never noticed me . Or perhaps seeing me inside he may have thought I was some understrapper belonging to the place . But when Mr. Powell nodded in my direction he became very quiet and gave me a long stare . Then he stooped to Mr. Powell 's ear -- I suppose he imagined he was whispering , but I heard him well enough . `` Looks very respectable . '' `` Certainly , '' says the shipping-master quite calm and staring all the time at me . `` His name 's Powell . '' `` Oh , I see ! '' says the skipper as if struck all of a heap . `` But is he ready to join at once ? '' `` I had a sort of vision of my lodgings -- in the North of London , too , beyond Dalston , away to the devil -- and all my gear scattered about , and my empty sea-chest somewhere in an outhouse the good people I was staying with had at the end of their sooty strip of garden . I heard the Shipping Master say in the coolest sort of way : '' He 'll sleep on board to-night . '' `` He had better , '' says the Captain of the _Ferndale_ very businesslike , as if the whole thing were settled . I ca n't say I was dumb for joy as you may suppose . It was n't exactly that . I was more by way of being out of breath with the quickness of it . It did n't seem possible that this was happening to me . But the skipper , after he had talked for a while with Mr. Powell , too low for me to hear became visibly perplexed . `` I suppose he had heard I was freshly passed and without experience as an officer , because he turned about and looked me over as if I had been exposed for sale . `` He 's young , '' he mutters . `` Looks smart , though . . . You 're smart and willing ( this to me very sudden and loud ) and all that , are n't you ? '' `` I just managed to open and shut my mouth , no more , being taken unawares . But it was enough for him . He made as if I had deafened him with protestations of my smartness and willingness . `` Of course , of course . All right . '' And then turning to the Shipping Master who sat there swinging his leg , he said that he certainly couldn't go to sea without a second officer . I stood by as if all these things were happening to some other chap whom I was seeing through with it . Mr. Powell stared at me with those shining eyes of his . But that bothered skipper turns upon me again as though he wanted to snap my head off . `` You are n't too big to be told how to do things -- are you ? You 've a lot to learn yet though you may n't think so . '' `` I had half a mind to save my dignity by telling him that if it was my seamanship he was alluding to I wanted him to understand that a fellow who had survived being turned inside out for an hour and a half by Captain R- was equal to any demand his old ship was likely to make on his competence . However he did n't give me a chance to make that sort of fool of myself because before I could open my mouth he had gone round on another tack and was addressing himself affably to Mr. Powell who swinging his leg never took his eyes off me . `` I 'll take your young friend willingly , Mr. Powell . If you let him sign on as second-mate at once I 'll take the Articles away with me now . '' `` It suddenly dawned upon me that the innocent skipper of the _Ferndale_ had taken it for granted that I was a relative of the Shipping Master ! I was quite astonished at this discovery , though indeed the mistake was natural enough under the circumstances . What I ought to have admired was the reticence with which this misunderstanding had been established and acted upon . But I was too stupid then to admire anything . All my anxiety was that this should be cleared up . I was ass enough to wonder exceedingly at Mr. Powell failing to notice the misapprehension . I saw a slight twitch come and go on his face ; but instead of setting right that mistake the Shipping Master swung round on his stool and addressed me as 'Charles . ' He did . And I detected him taking a hasty squint at my certificate just before , because clearly till he did so he was not sure of my christian name . `` Now then come round in front of the desk , Charles , '' says he in a loud voice . `` Charles ! At first , I declare to you , it did n't seem possible that he was addressing himself to me . I even looked round for that Charles but there was nobody behind me except the thin-necked chap still hard at his writing , and the other three Shipping Masters who were changing their coats and reaching for their hats , making ready to go home . It was the industrious thin-necked man who without laying down his pen lifted with his left hand a flap near his desk and said kindly : '' Pass this way . '' I walked through in a trance , faced Mr. Powell , from whom I learned that we were bound to Port Elizabeth first , and signed my name on the Articles of the ship _Ferndale_ as second mate -- the voyage not to exceed two years . `` You wo n't fail to join -- eh ? '' says the captain anxiously . `` It would cause no end of trouble and expense if you did . You 've got a good six hours to get your gear together , and then you 'll have time to snatch a sleep on board before the crew joins in the morning . '' `` It was easy enough for him to talk of getting ready in six hours for a voyage that was not to exceed two years . He had n't to do that trick himself , and with his sea-chest locked up in an outhouse the key of which had been mislaid for a week as I remembered . But neither was I much concerned . The idea that I was absolutely going to sea at six o'clock next morning had n't got quite into my head yet . It had been too sudden . `` Mr. Powell , slipping the Articles into a long envelope , spoke up with a sort of cold half-laugh without looking at either of us . `` Mind you do n't disgrace the name , Charles . '' `` And the skipper chimes in very kindly : '' He 'll do well enough I dare say . I 'll look after him a bit . '' `` Upon this he grabs the Articles , says something about trying to run in for a minute to see that poor devil in the hospital , and off he goes with his heavy swinging step after telling me sternly : `` Do n't you go like that poor fellow and get yourself run over by a cart as if you had n't either eyes or ears . '' `` Mr. Powell , '' says I timidly ( there was by then only the thin-necked man left in the office with us and he was already by the door , standing on one leg to turn the bottom of his trousers up before going away ) . `` Mr. Powell , '' says I , `` I believe the Captain of the _Ferndale_ was thinking all the time that I was a relation of yours . '' `` I was rather concerned about the propriety of it , you know , but Mr. Powell did n't seem to be in the least . `` Did he ? '' says he . `` That 's funny , because it seems to me too that I've been a sort of good uncle to several of you young fellows lately . Don't you think so yourself ? However , if you do n't like it you may put him right -- when you get out to sea . '' At this I felt a bit queer . Mr. Powell had rendered me a very good service : - because it 's a fact that with us merchant sailors the first voyage as officer is the real start in life . He had given me no less than that . I told him warmly that he had done for me more that day than all my relations put together ever did . `` Oh , no , no , '' says he . `` I guess it 's that shipment of explosives waiting down the river which has done most for you . Forty tons of dynamite have been your best friend to-day , young man . '' `` That was true too , perhaps . Anyway I saw clearly enough that I had nothing to thank myself for . But as I tried to thank him , he checked my stammering . `` Do n't be in a hurry to thank me , '' says he . `` The voyage is n't finished yet . '' Our new acquaintance paused , then added meditatively : `` Queer man . As if it made any difference . Queer man . '' `` It 's certainly unwise to admit any sort of responsibility for our actions , whose consequences we are never able to foresee , '' remarked Marlow by way of assent . `` The consequence of his action was that I got a ship , '' said the other . `` That could not do much harm , '' he added with a laugh which argued a probably unconscious contempt of general ideas . But Marlow was not put off . He was patient and reflective . He had been at sea many years and I verily believe he liked sea-life because upon the whole it is favourable to reflection . I am speaking of the now nearly vanished sea-life under sail . To those who may be surprised at the statement I will point out that this life secured for the mind of him who embraced it the inestimable advantages of solitude and silence . Marlow had the habit of pursuing general ideas in a peculiar manner , between jest and earnest . `` Oh , I would n't suggest , '' he said , `` that your namesake Mr. Powell , the Shipping Master , had done you much harm . Such was hardly his intention . And even if it had been he would not have had the power . He was but a man , and the incapacity to achieve anything distinctly good or evil is inherent in our earthly condition . Mediocrity is our mark . And perhaps it 's just as well , since , for the most part , we can not be certain of the effect of our actions . '' `` I do n't know about the effect , '' the other stood up to Marlow manfully . `` What effect did you expect anyhow ? I tell you he did something uncommonly kind . '' `` He did what he could , '' Marlow retorted gently , `` and on his own showing that was not a very great deal . I can not help thinking that there was some malice in the way he seized the opportunity to serve you . He managed to make you uncomfortable . You wanted to go to sea , but he jumped at the chance of accommodating your desire with a vengeance . I am inclined to think your cheek alarmed him . And this was an excellent occasion to suppress you altogether . For if you accepted he was relieved of you with every appearance of humanity , and if you made objections ( after requesting his assistance , mind you ) it was open to him to drop you as a sort of impostor . You might have had to decline that berth for some very valid reason . From sheer necessity perhaps . The notice was too uncommonly short . But under the circumstances you 'd have covered yourself with ignominy . '' Our new friend knocked the ashes out of his pipe . `` Quite a mistake , '' he said . `` I am not of the declining sort , though I'll admit it was something like telling a man that you would like a bath and in consequence being instantly knocked overboard to sink or swim with your clothes on . However , I did n't feel as if I were in deep water at first . I left the shipping office quietly and for a time strolled along the street as easy as if I had a week before me to fit myself out . But by and by I reflected that the notice was even shorter than it looked . The afternoon was well advanced ; I had some things to get , a lot of small matters to attend to , one or two persons to see . One of them was an aunt of mine , my only relation , who quarrelled with poor father as long as he lived about some silly matter that had neither right nor wrong to it . She left her money to me when she died . I used always to go and see her for decency 's sake . I had so much to do before night that I did n't know where to begin . I felt inclined to sit down on the kerb and hold my head in my hands . It was as if an engine had been started going under my skull . Finally I sat down in the first cab that came along and it was a hard matter to keep on sitting there I can tell you , while we rolled up and down the streets , pulling up here and there , the parcels accumulating round me and the engine in my head gathering more way every minute . The composure of the people on the pavements was provoking to a degree , and as to the people in shops , they were benumbed , more than half frozen -- imbecile . Funny how it affects you to be in a peculiar state of mind : everybody that does not act up to your excitement seems so confoundedly unfriendly . And my state of mind what with the hurry , the worry and a growing exultation was peculiar enough . That engine in my head went round at its top speed hour after hour till eleven at about at night it let up on me suddenly at the entrance to the Dock before large iron gates in a dead wall . '' * * * * * These gates were closed and locked . The cabby , after shooting his things off the roof of his machine into young Powell 's arms , drove away leaving him alone with his sea-chest , a sail cloth bag and a few parcels on the pavement about his feet . It was a dark , narrow thoroughfare he told us . A mean row of houses on the other side looked empty : there was n't the smallest gleam of light in them . The white-hot glare of a gin palace a good way off made the intervening piece of the street pitch black . Some human shapes appearing mysteriously , as if they had sprung up from the dark ground , shunned the edge of the faint light thrown down by the gateway lamps . These figures were wary in their movements and perfectly silent of foot , like beasts of prey slinking about a camp fire . Powell gathered up his belongings and hovered over them like a hen over her brood . A gruffly insinuating voice said : '' Let 's carry your things in , Capt'in ! I 've got my pal 'ere . '' He was a tall , bony , grey-haired ruffian with a bulldog jaw , in a torn cotton shirt and moleskin trousers . The shadow of his hobnailed boots was enormous and coffinlike . His pal , who did n't come up much higher than his elbow , stepping forward exhibited a pale face with a long drooping nose and no chin to speak of . He seemed to have just scrambled out of a dust-bin in a tam-o'shanter cap and a tattered soldier 's coat much too long for him . Being so deadly white he looked like a horrible dirty invalid in a ragged dressing gown . The coat flapped open in front and the rest of his apparel consisted of one brace which crossed his naked , bony chest , and a pair of trousers . He blinked rapidly as if dazed by the faint light , while his patron , the old bandit , glowered at young Powell from under his beetling brow . `` Say the word , Capt'in . The bobby 'll let us in all right . ' E knows both of us . '' `` I did n't answer him , '' continued Mr. Powell . `` I was listening to footsteps on the other side of the gate , echoing between the walls of the warehouses as if in an uninhabited town of very high buildings dark from basement to roof . You could never have guessed that within a stone's throw there was an open sheet of water and big ships lying afloat . The few gas lamps showing up a bit of brick work here and there , appeared in the blackness like penny dips in a range of cellars -- and the solitary footsteps came on , tramp , tramp . A dock policeman strode into the light on the other side of the gate , very broad-chested and stern . `` Hallo ! What 's up here ? '' `` He was really surprised , but after some palaver he let me in together with the two loafers carrying my luggage . He grumbled at them however and slammed the gate violently with a loud clang . I was startled to discover how many night prowlers had collected in the darkness of the street in such a short time and without my being aware of it . Directly we were through they came surging against the bars , silent , like a mob of ugly spectres . But suddenly , up the street somewhere , perhaps near that public-house , a row started as if Bedlam had broken loose : shouts , yells , an awful shrill shriek -- and at that noise all these heads vanished from behind the bars . `` Look at this , '' marvelled the constable . `` It 's a wonder to me they did n't make off with your things while you were waiting . '' `` I would have taken good care of that , '' I said defiantly . But the constable was n't impressed . `` Much you would have done . The bag going off round one dark corner ; the chest round another . Would you have run two ways at once ? And anyhow you 'd have been tripped up and jumped upon before you had run three yards . I tell you you 've had a most extraordinary chance that there was n't one of them regular boys about to-night , in the High Street , to twig your loaded cab go by . Ted here is honest . . . You are on the honest lay , Ted , ai n't you ? '' `` Always was , orficer , '' said the big ruffian with feeling . The other frail creature seemed dumb and only hopped about with the edge of its soldier coat touching the ground . `` Oh yes , I dare say , '' said the constable . `` Now then , forward , march . . . He 's that because he ai n't game for the other thing , '' he confided to me . `` He has n't got the nerve for it . However , I ai n't going to lose sight of them two till they go out through the gate . That little chap's a devil . He 's got the nerve for anything , only he has n't got the muscle . Well ! Well ! You 've had a chance to get in with a whole skin and with all your things . '' `` I was incredulous a little . It seemed impossible that after getting ready with so much hurry and inconvenience I should have lost my chance of a start in life from such a cause . I asked : '' Does that sort of thing happen often so near the dock gates ? '' `` Often ! No ! Of course not often . But it ai n't often either that a man comes along with a cabload of things to join a ship at this time of night . I 've been in the dock police thirteen years and have n't seen it done once . '' `` Meantime we followed my sea-chest which was being carried down a sort of deep narrow lane , separating two high warehouses , between honest Ted and his little devil of a pal who had to keep up a trot to the other's stride . The skirt of his soldier 's coat floating behind him nearly swept the ground so that he seemed to be running on castors . At the corner of the gloomy passage a rigged jib boom with a dolphin-striker ending in an arrow-head stuck out of the night close to a cast iron lamp-post . It was the quay side . They set down their load in the light and honest Ted asked hoarsely : '' Where 's your ship , guv'nor ? '' `` I did n't know . The constable was interested at my ignorance . `` Do n't know where your ship is ? '' he asked with curiosity . `` And you the second officer ! Have n't you been working on board of her ? '' `` I could n't explain that the only work connected with my appointment was the work of chance . I told him briefly that I did n't know her at all . At this he remarked : '' So I see . Here she is , right before you . That 's her . '' `` At once the head-gear in the gas light inspired me with interest and respect ; the spars were big , the chains and ropes stout and the whole thing looked powerful and trustworthy . Barely touched by the light her bows rose faintly alongside the narrow strip of the quay ; the rest of her was a black smudge in the darkness . Here I was face to face with my start in life . We walked in a body a few steps on a greasy pavement between her side and the towering wall of a warehouse and I hit my shins cruelly against the end of the gangway . The constable hailed her quietly in a bass undertone '_Ferndale_ there ! ' A feeble and dismal sound , something in the nature of a buzzing groan , answered from behind the bulwarks . `` I distinguished vaguely an irregular round knob , of wood , perhaps , resting on the rail . It did not move in the least ; but as another broken- down buzz like a still fainter echo of the first dismal sound proceeded from it I concluded it must be the head of the ship-keeper . The stalwart constable jeered in a mock-official manner . `` Second officer coming to join . Move yourself a bit . '' `` The truth of the statement touched me in the pit of the stomach ( you know that 's the spot where emotion gets home on a man ) for it was borne upon me that really and truly I was nothing but a second officer of a ship just like any other second officer , to that constable . I was moved by this solid evidence of my new dignity . Only his tone offended me . Nevertheless I gave him the tip he was looking for . Thereupon he lost all interest in me , humorous or otherwise , and walked away driving sternly before him the honest Ted , who went off grumbling to himself like a hungry ogre , and his horrible dumb little pal in the soldier 's coat , who , from first to last , never emitted the slightest sound . `` It was very dark on the quarter deck of the _Ferndale_ between the deep bulwarks overshadowed by the break of the poop and frowned upon by the front of the warehouse . I plumped down on to my chest near the after hatch as if my legs had been jerked from under me . I felt suddenly very tired and languid . The ship-keeper , whom I could hardly make out hung over the capstan in a fit of weak pitiful coughing . He gasped out very low 'Oh ! dear ! Oh ! dear ! ' and struggled for breath so long that I got up alarmed and irresolute . `` I 've been took like this since last Christmas twelvemonth . It ain't nothing . '' `` He seemed a hundred years old at least . I never saw him properly because he was gone ashore and out of sight when I came on deck in the morning ; but he gave me the notion of the feeblest creature that ever breathed . His voice was thin like the buzzing of a mosquito . As it would have been cruel to demand assistance from such a shadowy wreck I went to work myself , dragging my chest along a pitch-black passage under the poop deck , while he sighed and moaned around me as if my exertions were more than his weakness could stand . At last as I banged pretty heavily against the bulkheads he warned me in his faint breathless wheeze to be more careful . `` What 's the matter ? '' I asked rather roughly , not relishing to be admonished by this forlorn broken-down ghost . `` Nothing ! Nothing , sir , '' he protested so hastily that he lost his poor breath again and I felt sorry for him . `` Only the captain and his missus are sleeping on board . She 's a lady that must n't be disturbed . They came about half-past eight , and we had a permit to have lights in the cabin till ten to-night . '' `` This struck me as a considerable piece of news . I had never been in a ship where the captain had his wife with him . I 'd heard fellows say that captains ' wives could work a lot of mischief on board ship if they happened to take a dislike to anyone ; especially the new wives if young and pretty . The old and experienced wives on the other hand fancied they knew more about the ship than the skipper himself and had an eye like a hawk 's for what went on . They were like an extra chief mate of a particularly sharp and unfeeling sort who made his report in the evening . The best of them were a nuisance . In the general opinion a skipper with his wife on board was more difficult to please ; but whether to show off his authority before an admiring female or from loving anxiety for her safety or simply from irritation at her presence -- nobody I ever heard on the subject could tell for certain . `` After I had bundled in my things somehow I struck a match and had a dazzling glimpse of my berth ; then I pitched the roll of my bedding into the bunk but took no trouble to spread it out . I was n't sleepy now , neither was I tired . And the thought that I was done with the earth for many many months to come made me feel very quiet and self-contained as it were . Sailors will understand what I mean . '' Marlow nodded . `` It is a strictly professional feeling , '' he commented . `` But other professions or trades know nothing of it . It is only this calling whose primary appeal lies in the suggestion of restless adventure which holds out that deep sensation to those who embrace it . It is difficult to define , I admit . '' `` I should call it the peace of the sea , '' said Mr. Charles Powell in an earnest tone but looking at us as though he expected to be met by a laugh of derision and were half prepared to salve his reputation for common sense by joining in it . But neither of us laughed at Mr. Charles Powell in whose start in life we had been called to take a part . He was lucky in his audience . `` A very good name , '' said Marlow looking at him approvingly . `` A sailor finds a deep feeling of security in the exercise of his calling . The exacting life of the sea has this advantage over the life of the earth that its claims are simple and can not be evaded . '' `` Gospel truth , '' assented Mr. Powell . `` No ! they can not be evaded . '' That an excellent understanding should have established itself between my old friend and our new acquaintance was remarkable enough . For they were exactly dissimilar -- one individuality projecting itself in length and the other in breadth , which is already a sufficient ground for irreconcilable difference . Marlow who was lanky , loose , quietly composed in varied shades of brown robbed of every vestige of gloss , had a narrow , veiled glance , the neutral bearing and the secret irritability which go together with a predisposition to congestion of the liver . The other , compact , broad and sturdy of limb , seemed extremely full of sound organs functioning vigorously all the time in order to keep up the brilliance of his colouring , the light curl of his coal-black hair and the lustre of his eyes , which asserted themselves roundly in an open , manly face . Between two such organisms one would not have expected to find the slightest temperamental accord . But I have observed that profane men living in ships like the holy men gathered together in monasteries develop traits of profound resemblance . This must be because the service of the sea and the service of a temple are both detached from the vanities and errors of a world which follows no severe rule . The men of the sea understand each other very well in their view of earthly things , for simplicity is a good counsellor and isolation not a bad educator . A turn of mind composed of innocence and scepticism is common to them all , with the addition of an unexpected insight into motives , as of disinterested lookers-on at a game . Mr. Powell took me aside to say , '' I like the things he says . '' `` You understand each other pretty well , '' I observed . `` I know his sort , '' said Powell , going to the window to look at his cutter still riding to the flood . `` He 's the sort that 's always chasing some notion or other round and round his head just for the fun of the thing . '' `` Keeps them in good condition , '' I said . `` Lively enough I dare say , '' he admitted . `` Would you like better a man who let his notions lie curled up ? '' `` That I would n't , '' answered our new acquaintance . Clearly he was not difficult to get on with . `` I like him , very well , '' he continued , `` though it is n't easy to make him out . He seems to be up to a thing or two . What 's he doing ? '' I informed him that our friend Marlow had retired from the sea in a sort of half-hearted fashion some years ago . Mr. Powell 's comment was : `` Fancied had enough of it ? '' `` Fancied 's the very word to use in this connection , '' I observed , remembering the subtly provisional character of Marlow 's long sojourn amongst us . From year to year he dwelt on land as a bird rests on the branch of a tree , so tense with the power of brusque flight into its true element that it is incomprehensible why it should sit still minute after minute . The sea is the sailor 's true element , and Marlow , lingering on shore , was to me an object of incredulous commiseration like a bird , which , secretly , should have lost its faith in the high virtue of flying . CHAPTER TWO -- THE FYNES AND THE GIRL-FRIEND We were on our feet in the room by then , and Marlow , brown and deliberate , approached the window where Mr. Powell and I had retired . `` What was the name of your chance again ? '' he asked . Mr. Powell stared for a moment . `` Oh ! The _Ferndale_ . A Liverpool ship . Composite built . '' `` _Ferndale_ , '' repeated Marlow thoughtfully . `` _Ferndale_ . '' `` Know her ? '' `` Our friend , '' I said , `` knows something of every ship . He seems to have gone about the seas prying into things considerably . '' Marlow smiled . `` I 've seen her , at least once . '' `` The finest sea-boat ever launched , '' declared Mr. Powell sturdily . `` Without exception . '' `` She looked a stout , comfortable ship , '' assented Marlow . `` Uncommonly comfortable . Not very fast tho ' . '' `` She was fast enough for any reasonable man -- when I was in her , '' growled Mr. Powell with his back to us . `` Any ship is that -- for a reasonable man , '' generalized Marlow in a conciliatory tone . `` A sailor is n't a globe-trotter . '' `` No , '' muttered Mr. Powell . `` Time 's nothing to him , '' advanced Marlow . `` I do n't suppose it 's much , '' said Mr. Powell . `` All the same a quick passage is a feather in a man 's cap . '' `` True . But that ornament is for the use of the master only . And by the by what was his name ? '' `` The master of the _Ferndale_ ? Anthony . Captain Anthony . '' `` Just so . Quite right , '' approved Marlow thoughtfully . Our new acquaintance looked over his shoulder . `` What do you mean ? Why is it more right than if it had been Brown ? '' `` He has known him probably , '' I explained . `` Marlow here appears to know something of every soul that ever went afloat in a sailor 's body . '' Mr. Powell seemed wonderfully amenable to verbal suggestions for looking again out of the window , he muttered : '' He was a good soul . '' This clearly referred to Captain Anthony of the _Ferndale_ . Marlow addressed his protest to me . `` I did not know him . I really did n't . He was a good soul . That's nothing very much out of the way -- is it ? And I did n't even know that much of him . All I knew of him was an accident called Fyne . At this Mr. Powell who evidently could be rebellious too turned his back squarely on the window . `` What on earth do you mean ? '' he asked . `` An -- accident -- called Fyne , '' he repeated separating the words with emphasis . Marlow was not disconcerted . `` I do n't mean accident in the sense of a mishap . Not in the least . Fyne was a good little man in the Civil Service . By accident I mean that which happens blindly and without intelligent design . That 's generally the way a brother-in-law happens into a man 's life . '' Marlow 's tone being apologetic and our new acquaintance having again turned to the window I took it upon myself to say : '' You are justified . There is very little intelligent design in the majority of marriages ; but they are none the worse for that . Intelligence leads people astray as far as passion sometimes . I know you are not a cynic . '' Marlow smiled his retrospective smile which was kind as though he bore no grudge against people he used to know . `` Little Fyne 's marriage was quite successful . There was no design at all in it . Fyne , you must know , was an enthusiastic pedestrian . He spent his holidays tramping all over our native land . His tastes were simple . He put infinite conviction and perseverance into his holidays . At the proper season you would meet in the fields , Fyne , a serious-faced , broad- chested , little man , with a shabby knap-sack on his back , making for some church steeple . He had a horror of roads . He wrote once a little book called the 'Tramp 's Itinerary , ' and was recognised as an authority on the footpaths of England . So one year , in his favourite over-the-fields , back-way fashion he entered a pretty Surrey village where he met Miss Anthony . Pure accident , you see . They came to an understanding , across some stile , most likely . Little Fyne held very solemn views as to the destiny of women on this earth , the nature of our sublunary love , the obligations of this transient life and so on . He probably disclosed them to his future wife . Miss Anthony 's views of life were very decided too but in a different way . I do n't know the story of their wooing . I imagine it was carried on clandestinely and , I am certain , with portentous gravity , at the back of copses , behind hedges . . . `` Why was it carried on clandestinely ? '' I inquired . `` Because of the lady 's father . He was a savage sentimentalist who had his own decided views of his paternal prerogatives . He was a terror ; but the only evidence of imaginative faculty about Fyne was his pride in his wife 's parentage . It stimulated his ingenuity too . Difficult -- is it not ? -- to introduce one 's wife 's maiden name into general conversation . But my simple Fyne made use of Captain Anthony for that purpose , or else I would never even have heard of the man . `` My wife 's sailor-brother '' was the phrase . He trotted out the sailor-brother in a pretty wide range of subjects : Indian and colonial affairs , matters of trade , talk of travels , of seaside holidays and so on . Once I remember `` My wife 's sailor-brother Captain Anthony '' being produced in connection with nothing less recondite than a sunset . And little Fyne never failed to add `` The son of Carleon Anthony , the poet -- you know . '' He used to lower his voice for that statement , and people were impressed or pretended to be . '' The late Carleon Anthony , the poet , sang in his time of the domestic and social amenities of our age with a most felicitous versification , his object being , in his own words , `` to glorify the result of six thousand years ' evolution towards the refinement of thought , manners and feelings . '' Why he fixed the term at six thousand years I do n't know . His poems read like sentimental novels told in verse of a really superior quality . You felt as if you were being taken out for a delightful country drive by a charming lady in a pony carriage . But in his domestic life that same Carleon Anthony showed traces of the primitive cave-dweller 's temperament . He was a massive , implacable man with a handsome face , arbitrary and exacting with his dependants , but marvellously suave in his manner to admiring strangers . These contrasted displays must have been particularly exasperating to his long-suffering family . After his second wife 's death his boy , whom he persisted by a mere whim in educating at home , ran away in conventional style and , as if disgusted with the amenities of civilization , threw himself , figuratively speaking , into the sea . The daughter ( the elder of the two children ) either from compassion or because women are naturally more enduring , remained in bondage to the poet for several years , till she too seized a chance of escape by throwing herself into the arms , the muscular arms , of the pedestrian Fyne . This was either great luck or great sagacity . A civil servant is , I should imagine , the last human being in the world to preserve those traits of the cave-dweller from which she was fleeing . Her father would never consent to see her after the marriage . Such unforgiving selfishness is difficult to understand unless as a perverse sort of refinement . There were also doubts as to Carleon Anthony's complete sanity for some considerable time before he died . Most of the above I elicited from Marlow , for all I knew of Carleon Anthony was his unexciting but fascinating verse . Marlow assured me that the Fyne marriage was perfectly successful and even happy , in an earnest , unplayful fashion , being blessed besides by three healthy , active , self- reliant children , all girls . They were all pedestrians too . Even the youngest would wander away for miles if not restrained . Mrs. Fyne had a ruddy out-of-doors complexion and wore blouses with a starched front like a man 's shirt , a stand-up collar and a long necktie . Marlow had made their acquaintance one summer in the country , where they were accustomed to take a cottage for the holidays . . . At this point we were interrupted by Mr. Powell who declared that he must leave us . The tide was on the turn , he announced coming away from the window abruptly . He wanted to be on board his cutter before she swung and of course he would sleep on board . Never slept away from the cutter while on a cruise . He was gone in a moment , unceremoniously , but giving us no offence and leaving behind an impression as though we had known him for a long time . The ingenuous way he had told us of his start in life had something to do with putting him on that footing with us . I gave no thought to seeing him again . Marlow expressed a confident hope of coming across him before long . `` He cruises about the mouth of the river all the summer . He will be easy to find any week-end , '' he remarked ringing the bell so that we might settle up with the waiter . * * * * * Later on I asked Marlow why he wished to cultivate this chance acquaintance . He confessed apologetically that it was the commonest sort of curiosity . I flatter myself that I understand all sorts of curiosity . Curiosity about daily facts , about daily things , about daily men . It is the most respectable faculty of the human mind -- in fact I can not conceive the uses of an incurious mind . It would be like a chamber perpetually locked up . But in this particular case Mr. Powell seemed to have given us already a complete insight into his personality such as it was ; a personality capable of perception and with a feeling for the vagaries of fate , but essentially simple in itself . Marlow agreed with me so far . He explained however that his curiosity was not excited by Mr. Powell exclusively . It originated a good way further back in the fact of his accidental acquaintance with the Fynes , in the country . This chance meeting with a man who had sailed with Captain Anthony had revived it . It had revived it to some purpose , to such purpose that to me too was given the knowledge of its origin and of its nature . It was given to me in several stages , at intervals which are not indicated here . On this first occasion I remarked to Marlow with some surprise : '' But , if I remember rightly you said you did n't know Captain Anthony . '' `` No . I never saw the man . It 's years ago now , but I seem to hear solemn little Fyne 's deep voice announcing the approaching visit of his wife's brother `` the son of the poet , you know . '' He had just arrived in London from a long voyage , and , directly his occupations permitted , was coming down to stay with his relatives for a few weeks . No doubt we two should find many things to talk about by ourselves in reference to our common calling , added little Fyne portentously in his grave undertones , as if the Mercantile Marine were a secret society . You must understand that I cultivated the Fynes only in the country , in their holiday time . This was the third year . Of their existence in town I knew no more than may be inferred from analogy . I played chess with Fyne in the late afternoon , and sometimes came over to the cottage early enough to have tea with the whole family at a big round table . They sat about it , an unsmiling , sunburnt company of very few words indeed . Even the children were silent and as if contemptuous of each other and of their elders . Fyne muttered sometimes deep down in his chest some insignificant remark . Mrs. Fyne smiled mechanically ( she had splendid teeth ) while distributing tea and bread and butter . A something which was not coldness , nor yet indifference , but a sort of peculiar self-possession gave her the appearance of a very trustworthy , very capable and excellent governess ; as if Fyne were a widower and the children not her own but only entrusted to her calm , efficient , unemotional care . One expected her to address Fyne as Mr . When she called him John it surprised one like a shocking familiarity . The atmosphere of that holiday was -- if I may put it so -- brightly dull . Healthy faces , fair complexions , clear eyes , and never a frank smile in the whole lot , unless perhaps from a girl-friend . The girl-friend problem exercised me greatly . How and where the Fynes got all these pretty creatures to come and stay with them I can't imagine . I had at first the wild suspicion that they were obtained to amuse Fyne . But I soon discovered that he could hardly tell one from the other , though obviously their presence met with his solemn approval . These girls in fact came for Mrs. Fyne . They treated her with admiring deference . She answered to some need of theirs . They sat at her feet . They were like disciples . It was very curious . Of Fyne they took but scanty notice . As to myself I was made to feel that I did not exist . After tea we would sit down to chess and then Fyne 's everlasting gravity became faintly tinged by an attenuated gleam of something inward which resembled sly satisfaction . Of the divine frivolity of laughter he was only capable over a chess-board . Certain positions of the game struck him as humorous , which nothing else on earth could do . . . `` He used to beat you , '' I asserted with confidence . `` Yes . He used to beat me , '' Marlow owned up hastily . So he and Fyne played two games after tea . The children romped together outside , gravely , unplayfully , as one would expect from Fyne 's children , and Mrs. Fyne would be gone to the bottom of the garden with the girl- friend of the week . She always walked off directly after tea with her arm round the girl-friend 's waist . Marlow said that there was only one girl-friend with whom he had conversed at all . It had happened quite unexpectedly , long after he had given up all hope of getting into touch with these reserved girl-friends . One day he saw a woman walking about on the edge of a high quarry , which rose a sheer hundred feet , at least , from the road winding up the hill out of which it had been excavated . He shouted warningly to her from below where he happened to be passing . She was really in considerable danger . At the sound of his voice she started back and retreated out of his sight amongst some young Scotch firs growing near the very brink of the precipice . `` I sat down on a bank of grass , '' Marlow went on . `` She had given me a turn . The hem of her skirt seemed to float over that awful sheer drop , she was so close to the edge . An absurd thing to do . A perfectly mad trick -- for no conceivable object ! I was reflecting on the foolhardiness of the average girl and remembering some other instances of the kind , when she came into view walking down the steep curve of the road . She had Mrs. Fyne 's walking-stick and was escorted by the Fyne dog . Her dead white face struck me with astonishment , so that I forgot to raise my hat . I just sat and stared . The dog , a vivacious and amiable animal which for some inscrutable reason had bestowed his friendship on my unworthy self , rushed up the bank demonstratively and insinuated himself under my arm . The girl-friend ( it was one of them ) went past some way as though she had not seen me , then stopped and called the dog to her several times ; but he only nestled closer to my side , and when I tried to push him away developed that remarkable power of internal resistance by which a dog makes himself practically immovable by anything short of a kick . She looked over her shoulder and her arched eyebrows frowned above her blanched face . It was almost a scowl . Then the expression changed . She looked unhappy . `` Come here ! '' she cried once more in an angry and distressed tone . I took off my hat at last , but the dog hanging out his tongue with that cheerfully imbecile expression some dogs know so well how to put on when it suits their purpose , pretended to be deaf . She cried from the distance desperately . `` Perhaps you will take him to the cottage then . I ca n't wait . '' `` I wo n't be responsible for that dog , '' I protested getting down the bank and advancing towards her . She looked very hurt , apparently by the desertion of the dog . `` But if you let me walk with you he will follow us all right , '' I suggested . She moved on without answering me . The dog launched himself suddenly full speed down the road receding from us in a small cloud of dust . It vanished in the distance , and presently we came up with him lying on the grass . He panted in the shade of the hedge with shining eyes but pretended not to see us . We had not exchanged a word so far . The girl by my side gave him a scornful glance in passing . `` He offered to come with me , '' she remarked bitterly . `` And then abandoned you ! '' I sympathized . `` It looks very unchivalrous . But that 's merely his want of tact . I believe he meant to protest against your reckless proceedings . What made you come so near the edge of that quarry ? The earth might have given way . Have n't you noticed a smashed fir tree at the bottom ? Tumbled over only the other morning after a night 's rain . '' `` I do n't see why I should n't be as reckless as I please . '' I was nettled by her brusque manner of asserting her folly , and I told her that neither did I as far as that went , in a tone which almost suggested that she was welcome to break her neck for all I cared . This was considerably more than I meant , but I do n't like rude girls . I had been introduced to her only the day before -- at the round tea-table -- and she had barely acknowledged the introduction . I had not caught her name but I had noticed her fine , arched eyebrows which , so the physiognomists say , are a sign of courage . I examined her appearance quietly . Her hair was nearly black , her eyes blue , deeply shaded by long dark eyelashes . She had a little colour now . She looked straight before her ; the corner of her lip on my side drooped a little ; her chin was fine , somewhat pointed . I went on to say that some regard for others should stand in the way of one 's playing with danger . I urged playfully the distress of the poor Fynes in case of accident , if nothing else . I told her that she did not know the bucolic mind . Had she given occasion for a coroner 's inquest the verdict would have been suicide , with the implication of unhappy love . They would never be able to understand that she had taken the trouble to climb over two post-and-rail fences only for the fun of being reckless . Indeed even as I talked chaffingly I was greatly struck myself by the fact . She retorted that once one was dead what horrid people thought of one did not matter . It was said with infinite contempt ; but something like a suppressed quaver in the voice made me look at her again . I perceived then that her thick eyelashes were wet . This surprising discovery silenced me as you may guess . She looked unhappy . And -- I do n't know how to say it -- well -- it suited her . The clouded brow , the pained mouth , the vague fixed glance ! A victim . And this characteristic aspect made her attractive ; an individual touch -- you know . The dog had run on ahead and now gazed at us by the side of the Fyne's garden-gate in a tense attitude and wagging his stumpy tail very , very slowly , with an air of concentrated attention . The girl-friend of the Fynes bolted violently through the aforesaid gate and into the cottage leaving me on the road -- astounded . A couple of hours afterwards I returned to the cottage for chess as usual . I saw neither the girl nor Mrs. Fyne then . We had our two games and on parting I warned Fyne that I was called to town on business and might be away for some time . He regretted it very much . His brother-in- law was expected next day but he did n't know whether he was a chess-player . Captain Anthony ( `` the son of the poet -- you know '' ) was of a retiring disposition , shy with strangers , unused to society and very much devoted to his calling , Fyne explained . All the time they had been married he could be induced only once before to come and stay with them for a few days . He had had a rather unhappy boyhood ; and it made him a silent man . But no doubt , concluded Fyne , as if dealing portentously with a mystery , we two sailors should find much to say to one another . This point was never settled . I was detained in town from week to week till it seemed hardly worth while to go back . But as I had kept on my rooms in the farmhouse I concluded to go down again for a few days . It was late , deep dusk , when I got out at our little country station . My eyes fell on the unmistakable broad back and the muscular legs in cycling stockings of little Fyne . He passed along the carriages rapidly towards the rear of the train , which presently pulled out and left him solitary at the end of the rustic platform . When he came back to where I waited I perceived that he was much perturbed , so perturbed as to forget the convention of the usual greetings . He only exclaimed Oh ! on recognizing me , and stopped irresolute . When I asked him if he had been expecting somebody by that train he did n't seem to know . He stammered disconnectedly . I looked hard at him . To all appearances he was perfectly sober ; moreover to suspect Fyne of a lapse from the proprieties high or low , great or small , was absurd . He was also a too serious and deliberate person to go mad suddenly . But as he seemed to have forgotten that he had a tongue in his head I concluded I would leave him to his mystery . To my surprise he followed me out of the station and kept by my side , though I did not encourage him . I did not however repulse his attempts at conversation . He was no longer expecting me , he said . He had given me up . The weather had been uniformly fine -- and so on . I gathered also that the son of the poet had curtailed his stay somewhat and gone back to his ship the day before . That information touched me but little . Believing in heredity in moderation I knew well how sea-life fashions a man outwardly and stamps his soul with the mark of a certain prosaic fitness -- because a sailor is not an adventurer . I expressed no regret at missing Captain Anthony and we proceeded in silence till , on approaching the holiday cottage , Fyne suddenly and unexpectedly broke it by the hurried declaration that he would go on with me a little farther . `` Go with you to your door , '' he mumbled and started forward to the little gate where the shadowy figure of Mrs. Fyne hovered , clearly on the lookout for him . She was alone . The children must have been already in bed and I saw no attending girl-friend shadow near her vague but unmistakable form , half-lost in the obscurity of the little garden . I heard Fyne exclaim `` Nothing '' and then Mrs. Fyne 's well-trained , responsible voice uttered the words , `` It 's what I have said , '' with incisive equanimity . By that time I had passed on , raising my hat . Almost at once Fyne caught me up and slowed down to my strolling gait which must have been infinitely irksome to his high pedestrian faculties . I am sure that all his muscular person must have suffered from awful physical boredom ; but he did not attempt to charm it away by conversation . He preserved a portentous and dreary silence . And I was bored too . Suddenly I perceived the menace of even worse boredom . Yes ! He was so silent because he had something to tell me . I became extremely frightened . But man , reckless animal , is so made that in him curiosity , the paltriest curiosity , will overcome all terrors , every disgust , and even despair itself . To my laconic invitation to come in for a drink he answered by a deep , gravely accented : `` Thanks , I will '' as though it were a response in church . His face as seen in the lamplight gave me no clue to the character of the impending communication ; as indeed from the nature of things it could n't do , its normal expression being already that of the utmost possible seriousness . It was perfect and immovable ; and for a certainty if he had something excruciatingly funny to tell me it would be all the same . He gazed at me earnestly and delivered himself of some weighty remarks on Mrs. Fyne 's desire to befriend , counsel , and guide young girls of all sorts on the path of life . It was a voluntary mission . He approved his wife 's action and also her views and principles in general . All this with a solemn countenance and in deep measured tones . Yet somehow I got an irresistible conviction that he was exasperated by something in particular . In the unworthy hope of being amused by the misfortunes of a fellow-creature I asked him point-blank what was wrong now . What was wrong was that a girl-friend was missing . She had been missing precisely since six o'clock that morning . The woman who did the work of the cottage saw her going out at that hour , for a walk . The pedestrian Fyne 's ideas of a walk were extensive , but the girl did not turn up for lunch , nor yet for tea , nor yet for dinner . She had not turned up by footpath , road or rail . He had been reluctant to make inquiries . It would have set all the village talking . The Fynes had expected her to reappear every moment , till the shades of the night and the silence of slumber had stolen gradually over the wide and peaceful rural landscape commanded by the cottage . After telling me that much Fyne sat helpless in unconclusive agony . Going to bed was out of the question -- neither could any steps be taken just then . What to do with himself he did not know ! I asked him if this was the same young lady I saw a day or two before I went to town ? He really could not remember . Was she a girl with dark hair and blue eyes ? I asked further . He really could n't tell what colour her eyes were . He was very unobservant except as to the peculiarities of footpaths , on which he was an authority . I thought with amazement and some admiration that Mrs. Fyne 's young disciples were to her husband 's gravity no more than evanescent shadows . However , with but little hesitation Fyne ventured to affirm that -- yes , her hair was of some dark shade . `` We had a good deal to do with that girl first and last , '' he explained solemnly ; then getting up as if moved by a spring he snatched his cap off the table . `` She may be back in the cottage , '' he cried in his bass voice . I followed him out on the road . It was one of those dewy , clear , starry nights , oppressing our spirit , crushing our pride , by the brilliant evidence of the awful loneliness , of the hopeless obscure insignificance of our globe lost in the splendid revelation of a glittering , soulless universe . I hate such skies . Daylight is friendly to man toiling under a sun which warms his heart ; and cloudy soft nights are more kindly to our littleness . I nearly ran back again to my lighted parlour ; Fyne fussing in a knicker-bocker suit before the hosts of heaven , on a shadowy earth , about a transient , phantom-like girl , seemed too ridiculous to associate with . On the other hand there was something fascinating in the very absurdity . He cut along in his best pedestrian style and I found myself let in for a spell of severe exercise at eleven o'clock at night . In the distance over the fields and trees smudging and blotching the vast obscurity , one lighted window of the cottage with the blind up was like a bright beacon kept alight to guide the lost wanderer . Inside , at the table bearing the lamp , we saw Mrs. Fyne sitting with folded arms and not a hair of her head out of place . She looked exactly like a governess who had put the children to bed ; and her manner to me was just the neutral manner of a governess . To her husband , too , for that matter . Fyne told her that I was fully informed . Not a muscle of her ruddy smooth handsome face moved . She had schooled herself into that sort of thing . Having seen two successive wives of the delicate poet chivied and worried into their graves , she had adopted that cool , detached manner to meet her gifted father 's outbreaks of selfish temper . It had now become a second nature . I suppose she was always like that ; even in the very hour of elopement with Fyne . That transaction when one remembered it in her presence acquired a quaintly marvellous aspect to one 's imagination . But somehow her self-possession matched very well little Fyne's invariable solemnity . I was rather sorry for him . Was n't he worried ! The agony of solemnity . At the same time I was amused . I did n't take a gloomy view of that '' vanishing girl '' trick . Somehow I could n't . But I said nothing . None of us said anything . We sat about that big round table as if assembled for a conference and looked at each other in a sort of fatuous consternation . I would have ended by laughing outright if I had not been saved from that impropriety by poor Fyne becoming preposterous . He began with grave anguish to talk of going to the police in the morning , of printing descriptive bills , of setting people to drag the ponds for miles around . It was extremely gruesome . I murmured something about communicating with the young lady 's relatives . It seemed to me a very natural suggestion ; but Fyne and his wife exchanged such a significant glance that I felt as though I had made a tactless remark . But I really wanted to help poor Fyne ; and as I could see that , manlike , he suffered from the present inability to act , the passive waiting , I said : `` Nothing of this can be done till to-morrow . But as you have given me an insight into the nature of your thoughts I can tell you what may be done at once . We may go and look at the bottom of the old quarry which is on the level of the road , about a mile from here . '' The couple made big eyes at this , and then I told them of my meeting with the girl . You may be surprised but I assure you I had not perceived this aspect of it till that very moment . It was like a startling revelation ; the past throwing a sinister light on the future . Fyne opened his mouth gravely and as gravely shut it . Nothing more . Mrs. Fyne said , `` You had better go , '' with an air as if her self-possession had been pricked with a pin in some secret place . And I -- you know how stupid I can be at times -- I perceived with dismay for the first time that by pandering to Fyne 's morbid fancies I had let myself in for some more severe exercise . And was n't I sorry I spoke ! You know how I hate walking -- at least on solid , rural earth ; for I can walk a ship 's deck a whole foggy night through , if necessary , and think little of it . There is some satisfaction too in playing the vagabond in the streets of a big town till the sky pales above the ridges of the roofs . I have done that repeatedly for pleasure -- of a sort . But to tramp the slumbering country-side in the dark is for me a wearisome nightmare of exertion . With perfect detachment Mrs. Fyne watched me go out after her husband . That woman was flint . * * * * * The fresh night had a smell of soil , of turned-up sods like a grave -- an association particularly odious to a sailor by its idea of confinement and narrowness ; yes , even when he has given up the hope of being buried at sea ; about the last hope a sailor gives up consciously after he has been , as it does happen , decoyed by some chance into the toils of the land . A strong grave-like sniff . The ditch by the side of the road must have been freshly dug in front of the cottage . Once clear of the garden Fyne gathered way like a racing cutter . What was a mile to him -- or twenty miles ? You think he might have gone shrinkingly on such an errand . But not a bit of it . The force of pedestrian genius I suppose . I raced by his side in a mood of profound self-derision , and infinitely vexed with that minx . Because dead or alive I thought of her as a minx . . . '' I smiled incredulously at Marlow 's ferocity ; but Marlow pausing with a whimsically retrospective air , never flinched . `` Yes , yes . Even dead . And now you are shocked . You see , you are such a chivalrous masculine beggar . But there is enough of the woman in my nature to free my judgment of women from glamorous reticency . And then , why should I upset myself ? A woman is not necessarily either a doll or an angel to me . She is a human being , very much like myself . And I have come across too many dead souls lying so to speak at the foot of high unscaleable places for a merely possible dead body at the bottom of a quarry to strike my sincerity dumb . The cliff-like face of the quarry looked forbiddingly impressive . I will admit that Fyne and I hung back for a moment before we made a plunge off the road into the bushes growing in a broad space at the foot of the towering limestone wall . These bushes were heavy with dew . There were also concealed mudholes in there . We crept and tumbled and felt about with our hands along the ground . We got wet , scratched , and plastered with mire all over our nether garments . Fyne fell suddenly into a strange cavity -- probably a disused lime-kiln . His voice uplifted in grave distress sounded more than usually rich , solemn and profound . This was the comic relief of an absurdly dramatic situation . While hauling him out I permitted myself to laugh aloud at last . Fyne , of course , did n't . I need not tell you that we found nothing after a most conscientious search . Fyne even pushed his way into a decaying shed half-buried in dew- soaked vegetation . He struck matches , several of them too , as if to make absolutely sure that the vanished girl-friend of his wife was not hiding there . The short flares illuminated his grave , immovable countenance while I let myself go completely and laughed in peals . I asked him if he really and truly supposed that any sane girl would go and hide in that shed ; and if so why ? Disdainful of my mirth he merely muttered his basso-profundo thankfulness that we had not found her anywhere about there . Having grown extremely sensitive ( an effect of irritation ) to the tonalities , I may say , of this affair , I felt that it was only an imperfect , reserved , thankfulness , with one eye still on the possibilities of the several ponds in the neighbourhood . And I remember I snorted , I positively snorted , at that poor Fyne . What really jarred upon me was the rate of his walking . Differences in politics , in ethics and even in aesthetics need not arouse angry antagonism . One 's opinion may change ; one 's tastes may alter -- in fact they do . One 's very conception of virtue is at the mercy of some felicitous temptation which may be sprung on one any day . All these things are perpetually on the swing . But a temperamental difference , temperament being immutable , is the parent of hate . That 's why religious quarrels are the fiercest of all . My temperament , in matters pertaining to solid land , is the temperament of leisurely movement , of deliberate gait . And there was that little Fyne pounding along the road in a most offensive manner ; a man wedded to thick-soled , laced boots ; whereas my temperament demands thin shoes of the lightest kind . Of course there could never have been question of friendship between us ; but under the provocation of having to keep up with his pace I began to dislike him actively . I begged sarcastically to know whether he could tell me if we were engaged in a farce or in a tragedy . I wanted to regulate my feelings which , I told him , were in an unbecoming state of confusion . But Fyne was as impervious to sarcasm as a turtle . He tramped on , and all he did was to ejaculate twice out of his deep chest , vaguely , doubtfully . `` I am afraid . . . I am afraid ! . . . `` This was tragic . The thump of his boots was the only sound in a shadowy world . I kept by his side with a comparatively ghostly , silent tread . By a strange illusion the road appeared to run up against a lot of low stars at no very great distance , but as we advanced new stretches of whitey- brown ribbon seemed to come up from under the black ground . I observed , as we went by , the lamp in my parlour in the farmhouse still burning . But I did not leave Fyne to run in and put it out . The impetus of his pedestrian excellence carried me past in his wake before I could make up my mind . `` Tell me , Fyne , '' I cried , `` you do n't think the girl was mad -- do you ? '' He answered nothing . Soon the lighted beacon-like window of the cottage came into view . Then Fyne uttered a solemn : `` Certainly not , '' with profound assurance . But immediately after he added a `` Very highly strung young person indeed , '' which unsettled me again . Was it a tragedy ? `` Nobody ever got up at six o'clock in the morning to commit suicide , '' I declared crustily . `` It 's unheard of ! This is a farce . '' As a matter of fact it was neither farce nor tragedy . Coming up to the cottage we had a view of Mrs. Fyne inside still sitting in the strong light at the round table with folded arms . It looked as though she had not moved her very head by as much as an inch since we went away . She was amazing in a sort of unsubtle way ; crudely amazing -- I thought . Why crudely ? I do n't know . Perhaps because I saw her then in a crude light . I mean this materially -- in the light of an unshaded lamp . Our mental conclusions depend so much on momentary physical sensations -- do n't they ? If the lamp had been shaded I should perhaps have gone home after expressing politely my concern at the Fynes' unpleasant predicament . Losing a girl-friend in that manner is unpleasant . It is also mysterious . So mysterious that a certain mystery attaches to the people to whom such a thing does happen . Moreover I had never really understood the Fynes ; he with his solemnity which extended to the very eating of bread and butter ; she with that air of detachment and resolution in breasting the common-place current of their unexciting life , in which the cutting of bread and butter appeared to me , by a long way , the most dangerous episode . Sometimes I amused myself by supposing that to their minds this world of ours must be wearing a perfectly overwhelming aspect , and that their heads contained respectively awfully serious and extremely desperate thoughts -- and trying to imagine what an exciting time they must be having of it in the inscrutable depths of their being . This last was difficult to a volatile person ( I am sure that to the Fynes I was a volatile person ) and the amusement in itself was not very great ; but still -- in the country -- away from all mental stimulants ! . . . My efforts had invested them with a sort of amusing profundity . But when Fyne and I got back into the room , then in the searching , domestic , glare of the lamp , inimical to the play of fancy , I saw these two stripped of every vesture it had amused me to put on them for fun . Queer enough they were . Is there a human being that is n't that -- more or less secretly ? But whatever their secret , it was manifest to me that it was neither subtle nor profound . They were a good , stupid , earnest couple and very much bothered . They were that -- with the usual unshaded crudity of average people . There was nothing in them that the lamplight might not touch without the slightest risk of indiscretion . Directly we had entered the room Fyne announced the result by saying '' Nothing '' in the same tone as at the gate on his return from the railway station . And as then Mrs. Fyne uttered an incisive `` It 's what I've said , '' which might have been the veriest echo of her words in the garden . We three looked at each other as if on the brink of a disclosure . I do n't know whether she was vexed at my presence . It could hardly be called intrusion -- could it ? Little Fyne began it . It had to go on . We stood before her , plastered with the same mud ( Fyne was a sight ! ) , scratched by the same brambles , conscious of the same experience . Yes . Before her . And she looked at us with folded arms , with an extraordinary fulness of assumed responsibility . I addressed her . `` You do n't believe in an accident , Mrs. Fyne , do you ? '' She shook her head in curt negation while , caked in mud and inexpressibly serious-faced , Fyne seemed to be backing her up with all the weight of his solemn presence . Nothing more absurd could be conceived . It was delicious . And I went on in deferential accents : `` Am I to understand then that you entertain the theory of suicide ? '' I do n't know that I am liable to fits of delirium but by a sudden and alarming aberration while waiting for her answer I became mentally aware of three trained dogs dancing on their hind legs . I do n't know why . Perhaps because of the pervading solemnity . There 's nothing more solemn on earth than a dance of trained dogs . `` She has chosen to disappear . That 's all . '' In these words Mrs. Fyne answered me . The aggressive tone was too much for my endurance . In an instant I found myself out of the dance and down on all-fours so to speak , with liberty to bark and bite . `` The devil she has , '' I cried . `` Has chosen to . . . Like this , all at once , anyhow , regardless . . . I 've had the privilege of meeting that reckless and brusque young lady and I must say that with her air of an angry victim . . . `` `` Precisely , '' Mrs. Fyne said very unexpectedly like a steel trap going off . I stared at her . How provoking she was ! So I went on to finish my tirade . `` She struck me at first sight as the most inconsiderate wrong- headed girl that I ever . . . `` `` Why should a girl be more considerate than anyone else ? More than any man , for instance ? '' inquired Mrs. Fyne with a still greater assertion of responsibility in her bearing . Of course I exclaimed at this , not very loudly it is true , but forcibly . Were then the feelings of friends , relations and even of strangers to be disregarded ? I asked Mrs. Fyne if she did not think it was a sort of duty to show elementary consideration not only for the natural feelings but even for the prejudices of one 's fellow-creatures . Her answer knocked me over . `` Not for a woman . '' Just like that . I confess that I went down flat . And while in that collapsed state I learned the true nature of Mrs. Fyne 's feminist doctrine . It was not political , it was not social . It was a knock-me- down doctrine -- a practical individualistic doctrine . You would not thank me for expounding it to you at large . Indeed I think that she herself did not enlighten me fully . There must have been things not fit for a man to hear . But shortly , and as far as my bewilderment allowed me to grasp its naive atrociousness , it was something like this : that no consideration , no delicacy , no tenderness , no scruples should stand in the way of a woman ( who by the mere fact of her sex was the predestined victim of conditions created by men 's selfish passions , their vices and their abominable tyranny ) from taking the shortest cut towards securing for herself the easiest possible existence . She had even the right to go out of existence without considering anyone 's feelings or convenience since some women 's existences were made impossible by the shortsighted baseness of men . I looked at her , sitting before the lamp at one o'clock in the morning , with her mature , smooth-cheeked face of masculine shape robbed of its freshness by fatigue ; at her eyes dimmed by this senseless vigil . I looked also at Fyne ; the mud was drying on him ; he was obviously tired . The weariness of solemnity . But he preserved an unflinching , endorsing , gravity of expression . Endorsing it all as became a good , convinced husband . `` Oh ! I see , '' I said . `` No consideration . . . Well I hope you like it . '' They amused me beyond the wildest imaginings of which I was capable . After the first shock , you understand , I recovered very quickly . The order of the world was safe enough . He was a civil servant and she his good and faithful wife . But when it comes to dealing with human beings anything , anything may be expected . So even my astonishment did not last very long . How far she developed and illustrated that conscienceless and austere doctrine to the girl-friends , who were mere transient shadows to her husband , I could not tell . Any length I supposed . And he looked on , acquiesced , approved , just for that very reason -- because these pretty girls were but shadows to him . O ! Most virtuous Fyne ! He cast his eyes down . He did n't like it . But I eyed him with hidden animosity for he had got me to run after him under somewhat false pretences . Mrs. Fyne had only smiled at me very expressively , very self-confidently . `` Oh I quite understand that you accept the fullest responsibility , '' I said . `` I am the only ridiculous person in this -- this -- I do n't know how to call it -- performance . However , I 've nothing more to do here , so I'll say good-night -- or good morning , for it must be past one . '' But before departing , in common decency , I offered to take any wires they might write . My lodgings were nearer the post-office than the cottage and I would send them off the first thing in the morning . I supposed they would wish to communicate , if only as to the disposal of the luggage , with the young lady 's relatives . . . Fyne , he looked rather downcast by then , thanked me and declined . `` There is really no one , '' he said , very grave . `` No one , '' I exclaimed . `` Practically , '' said curt Mrs. Fyne . And my curiosity was aroused again . `` Ah ! I see . An orphan . '' Mrs. Fyne looked away weary and sombre , and Fyne said `` Yes '' impulsively , and then qualified the affirmative by the quaint statement : `` To a certain extent . '' I became conscious of a languid , exhausted embarrassment , bowed to Mrs. Fyne , and went out of the cottage to be confronted outside its door by the bespangled , cruel revelation of the Immensity of the Universe . The night was not sufficiently advanced for the stars to have paled ; and the earth seemed to me more profoundly asleep -- perhaps because I was alone now . Not having Fyne with me to set the pace I let myself drift , rather than walk , in the direction of the farmhouse . To drift is the only reposeful sort of motion ( ask any ship if it is n't ) and therefore consistent with thoughtfulness . And I pondered : How is one an orphan `` to a certain extent '' ? No amount of solemnity could make such a statement other than bizarre . What a strange condition to be in . Very likely one of the parents only was dead ? But no ; it could n't be , since Fyne had said just before that '' there was really no one '' to communicate with . No one ! And then remembering Mrs. Fyne 's snappy `` Practically '' my thoughts fastened upon that lady as a more tangible object of speculation . I wondered -- and wondering I doubted -- whether she really understood herself the theory she had propounded to me . Everything may be said -- indeed ought to be said -- providing we know how to say it . She probably did not . She was not intelligent enough for that . She had no knowledge of the world . She had got hold of words as a child might get hold of some poisonous pills and play with them for `` dear , tiny little marbles . '' No ! The domestic-slave daughter of Carleon Anthony and the little Fyne of the Civil Service ( that flower of civilization ) were not intelligent people . They were commonplace , earnest , without smiles and without guile . But he had his solemnities and she had her reveries , her lurid , violent , crude reveries . And I thought with some sadness that all these revolts and indignations , all these protests , revulsions of feeling , pangs of suffering and of rage , expressed but the uneasiness of sensual beings trying for their share in the joys of form , colour , sensations -- the only riches of our world of senses . A poet may be a simple being but he is bound to be various and full of wiles , ingenious and irritable . I reflected on the variety of ways the ingenuity of the late bard of civilization would be able to invent for the tormenting of his dependants . Poets not being generally foresighted in practical affairs , no vision of consequences would restrain him . Yes . The Fynes were excellent people , but Mrs. Fyne was n't the daughter of a domestic tyrant for nothing . There were no limits to her revolt . But they were excellent people . It was clear that they must have been extremely good to that girl whose position in the world seemed somewhat difficult , with her face of a victim , her obvious lack of resignation and the bizarre status of orphan `` to a certain extent . '' Such were my thoughts , but in truth I soon ceased to trouble about all these people . I found that my lamp had gone out leaving behind an awful smell . I fled from it up the stairs and went to bed in the dark . My slumbers -- I suppose the one good in pedestrian exercise , confound it , is that it helps our natural callousness -- my slumbers were deep , dreamless and refreshing . My appetite at breakfast was not affected by my ignorance of the facts , motives , events and conclusions . I think that to understand everything is not good for the intellect . A well-stocked intelligence weakens the impulse to action ; an overstocked one leads gently to idiocy . But Mrs. Fyne 's individualist woman-doctrine , naively unscrupulous , flitted through my mind . The salad of unprincipled notions she put into these girl-friends ' heads ! Good innocent creature , worthy wife , excellent mother ( of the strict governess type ) , she was as guileless of consequences as any determinist philosopher ever was . As to honour -- you know -- it 's a very fine medieval inheritance which women never got hold of . It was n't theirs . Since it may be laid as a general principle that women always get what they want we must suppose they did n't want it . In addition they are devoid of decency . I mean masculine decency . Cautiousness too is foreign to them -- the heavy reasonable cautiousness which is our glory . And if they had it they would make of it a thing of passion , so that its own mother -- I mean the mother of cautiousness -- would n't recognize it . Prudence with them is a matter of thrill like the rest of sublunary contrivances . `` Sensation at any cost , '' is their secret device . All the virtues are not enough for them ; they want also all the crimes for their own . And why ? Because in such completeness there is power -- the kind of thrill they love most . . . '' `` Do you expect me to agree to all this ? '' I interrupted . `` No , it is n't necessary , '' said Marlow , feeling the check to his eloquence but with a great effort at amiability . `` You need not even understand it . I continue : with such disposition what prevents women -- to use the phrase an old boatswain of my acquaintance applied descriptively to his captain -- what prevents them from `` coming on deck and playing hell with the ship '' generally , is that something in them precise and mysterious , acting both as restraint and as inspiration ; their femininity in short which they think they can get rid of by trying hard , but ca n't , and never will . Therefore we may conclude that , for all their enterprises , the world is and remains safe enough . Feeling , in my character of a lover of peace , soothed by that conclusion I prepared myself to enjoy a fine day . And it was a fine day ; a delicious day , with the horror of the Infinite veiled by the splendid tent of blue ; a day innocently bright like a child with a washed face , fresh like an innocent young girl , suave in welcoming one 's respects like -- like a Roman prelate . I love such days . They are perfection for remaining indoors . And I enjoyed it temperamentally in a chair , my feet up on the sill of the open window , a book in my hands and the murmured harmonies of wind and sun in my heart making an accompaniment to the rhythms of my author . Then looking up from the page I saw outside a pair of grey eyes thatched by ragged yellowy-white eyebrows gazing at me solemnly over the toes of my slippers . There was a grave , furrowed brow surmounting that portentous gaze , a brown tweed cap set far back on the perspiring head . `` Come inside , '' I cried as heartily as my sinking heart would permit . After a short but severe scuffle with his dog at the outer door , Fyne entered . I treated him without ceremony and only waved my hand towards a chair . Even before he sat down he gasped out : '' We 've heard -- midday post . '' Gasped out ! The grave , immovable Fyne of the Civil Service , gasped ! This was enough , you 'll admit , to cause me to put my feet to the ground swiftly . That fellow was always making me do things in subtle discord with my meditative temperament . No wonder that I had but a qualified liking for him . I said with just a suspicion of jeering tone : '' Of course . I told you last night on the road that it was a farce we were engaged in . '' He made the little parlour resound to its foundations with a note of anger positively sepulchral in its depth of tone . `` Farce be hanged ! She has bolted with my wife 's brother , Captain Anthony . '' This outburst was followed by complete subsidence . He faltered miserably as he added from force of habit : `` The son of the poet , you know . '' A silence fell . Fyne 's several expressions were so many examples of varied consistency . This was the discomfiture of solemnity . My interest of course was revived . `` But hold on , '' I said . `` They did n't go together . Is it a suspicion or does she actually say that . . . `` `` She has gone after him , '' stated Fyne in comminatory tones . `` By previous arrangement . She confesses that much . '' He added that it was very shocking . I asked him whether he should have preferred them going off together ; and on what ground he based that preference . This was sheer fun for me in regard of the fact that Fyne's too was a runaway match , which even got into the papers in its time , because the late indignant poet had no discretion and sought to avenge this outrage publicly in some absurd way before a bewigged judge . The dejected gesture of little Fyne 's hand disarmed my mocking mood . But I could not help expressing my surprise that Mrs. Fyne had not detected at once what was brewing . Women were supposed to have an unerring eye . He told me that his wife had been very much engaged in a certain work . I had always wondered how she occupied her time . It was in writing . Like her husband she too published a little book . Much later on I came upon it . It had nothing to do with pedestrianism . It was a sort of hand-book for women with grievances ( and all women had them ) , a sort of compendious theory and practice of feminine free morality . It made you laugh at its transparent simplicity . But that authorship was revealed to me much later . I did n't of course ask Fyne what work his wife was engaged on ; but I marvelled to myself at her complete ignorance of the world , of her own sex and of the other kind of sinners . Yet , where could she have got any experience ? Her father had kept her strictly cloistered . Marriage with Fyne was certainly a change but only to another kind of claustration . You may tell me that the ordinary powers of observation ought to have been enough . Why , yes ! But , then , as she had set up for a guide and teacher , there was nothing surprising for me in the discovery that she was blind . That 's quite in order . She was a profoundly innocent person ; only it would not have been proper to tell her husband so . CHAPTER THREE -- THRIFT -- AND THE CHILD But there was nothing improper in my observing to Fyne that , last night , Mrs. Fyne seemed to have some idea where that enterprising young lady had gone to . Fyne shook his head . No ; his wife had been by no means so certain as she had pretended to be . She merely had her reasons to think , to hope , that the girl might have taken a room somewhere in London , had buried herself in town -- in readiness or perhaps in horror of the approaching day -- He ceased and sat solemnly dejected , in a brown study . `` What day ? '' I asked at last ; but he did not hear me apparently . He diffused such portentous gloom into the atmosphere that I lost patience with him . `` What on earth are you so dismal about ? '' I cried , being genuinely surprised and puzzled . `` One would think the girl was a state prisoner under your care . '' And suddenly I became still more surprised at myself , at the way I had somehow taken for granted things which did appear queer when one thought them out . `` But why this secrecy ? Why did they elope -- if it is an elopement ? Was the girl afraid of your wife ? And your brother-in-law ? What on earth possesses him to make a clandestine match of it ? Was he afraid of your wife too ? '' Fyne made an effort to rouse himself . `` Of course my brother-in-law , Captain Anthony , the son of . . . `` He checked himself as if trying to break a bad habit . `` He would be persuaded by her . We have been most friendly to the girl ! '' `` She struck me as a foolish and inconsiderate little person . But why should you and your wife take to heart so strongly mere folly -- or even a want of consideration ? '' `` It 's the most unscrupulous action , '' declared Fyne weightily -- and sighed . `` I suppose she is poor , '' I observed after a short silence . `` But after all . . . `` `` You do n't know who she is . '' Fyne had regained his average solemnity . I confessed that I had not caught her name when his wife had introduced us to each other . `` It was something beginning with an S- was n't it ? '' And then with the utmost coolness Fyne remarked that it did not matter . The name was not her name . `` Do you mean to say that you made a young lady known to me under a false name ? '' I asked , with the amused feeling that the days of wonders and portents had not passed away yet . That the eminently serious Fynes should do such an exceptional thing was simply staggering . With a more hasty enunciation than usual little Fyne was sure that I would not demand an apology for this irregularity if I knew what her real name was . A sort of warmth crept into his deep tone . `` We have tried to befriend that girl in every way . She is the daughter and only child of de Barral . '' Evidently he expected to produce a sensation ; he kept his eyes fixed upon me prepared for some sign of it . But I merely returned his intense , awaiting gaze . For a time we stared at each other . Conscious of being reprehensibly dense I groped in the darkness of my mind : De Barral , De Barral -- and all at once noise and light burst on me as if a window of my memory had been suddenly flung open on a street in the City . De Barral ! But could it be the same ? Surely not ! `` The financier ? '' I suggested half incredulous . `` Yes , '' said Fyne ; and in this instance his native solemnity of tone seemed to be strangely appropriate . `` The convict . '' Marlow looked at me , significantly , and remarked in an explanatory tone : '' One somehow never thought of de Barral as having any children , or any other home than the offices of the `` Orb '' ; or any other existence , associations or interests than financial . I see you remember the crash . . . `` `` I was away in the Indian Seas at the time , '' I said . `` But of course -- '' '' Of course , '' Marlow struck in . `` All the world . . . You may wonder at my slowness in recognizing the name . But you know that my memory is merely a mausoleum of proper names . There they lie inanimate , awaiting the magic touch -- and not very prompt in arising when called , either . The name is the first thing I forget of a man . It is but just to add that frequently it is also the last , and this accounts for my possession of a good many anonymous memories . In de Barral 's case , he got put away in my mausoleum in company with so many names of his own creation that really he had to throw off a monstrous heap of grisly bones before he stood before me at the call of the wizard Fyne . The fellow had a pretty fancy in names : the `` Orb '' Deposit Bank , the `` Sceptre '' Mutual Aid Society , the '' Thrift and Independence '' Association . Yes , a very pretty taste in names ; and nothing else besides -- absolutely nothing -- no other merit . Well yes . He had another name , but that 's pure luck -- his own name of de Barral which he did not invent . I do n't think that a mere Jones or Brown could have fished out from the depths of the Incredible such a colossal manifestation of human folly as that man did . But it may be that I am underestimating the alacrity of human folly in rising to the bait . No doubt I am . The greed of that absurd monster is incalculable , unfathomable , inconceivable . The career of de Barral demonstrates that it will rise to a naked hook . He did n't lure it with a fairy tale . He had n't enough imagination for it . . . `` `` Was he a foreigner ? '' I asked . `` It 's clearly a French name . I suppose it _was_ his name ? '' `` Oh , he did n't invent it . He was born to it , in Bethnal Green , as it came out during the proceedings . He was in the habit of alluding to his Scotch connections . But every great man has done that . The mother , I believe , was Scotch , right enough . The father de Barral whatever his origins retired from the Customs Service ( tide-waiter I think ) , and started lending money in a very , very small way in the East End to people connected with the docks , stevedores , minor barge-owners , ship-chandlers , tally clerks , all sorts of very small fry . He made his living at it . He was a very decent man I believe . He had enough influence to place his only son as junior clerk in the account department of one of the Dock Companies . `` Now , my boy , '' he said to him , `` I 've given you a fine start . '' But de Barral did n't start . He stuck . He gave perfect satisfaction . At the end of three years he got a small rise of salary and went out courting in the evenings . He went courting the daughter of an old sea- captain who was a churchwarden of his parish and lived in an old badly preserved Georgian house with a garden : one of these houses standing in a reduced bit of `` grounds '' that you discover in a labyrinth of the most sordid streets , exactly alike and composed of six-roomed hutches . Some of them were the vicarages of slum parishes . The old sailor had got hold of one cheap , and de Barral got hold of his daughter -- which was a good bargain for him . The old sailor was very good to the young couple and very fond of their little girl . Mrs. de Barral was an equable , unassuming woman , at that time with a fund of simple gaiety , and with no ambitions ; but , woman-like , she longed for change and for something interesting to happen now and then . It was she who encouraged de Barral to accept the offer of a post in the west-end branch of a great bank . It appears he shrank from such a great adventure for a long time . At last his wife 's arguments prevailed . Later on she used to say : 'It 's the only time he ever listened to me ; and I wonder now if it had n't been better for me to die before I ever made him go into that bank . ' You may be surprised at my knowledge of these details . Well , I had them ultimately from Mrs. Fyne . Mrs. Fyne while yet Miss Anthony , in her days of bondage , knew Mrs. de Barral in her days of exile . Mrs. de Barral was living then in a big stone mansion with mullioned windows in a large damp park , called the Priory , adjoining the village where the refined poet had built himself a house . These were the days of de Barral 's success . He had bought the place without ever seeing it and had packed off his wife and child at once there to take possession . He did not know what to do with them in London . He himself had a suite of rooms in an hotel . He gave there dinner parties followed by cards in the evening . He had developed the gambling passion -- or else a mere card mania -- but at any rate he played heavily , for relaxation , with a lot of dubious hangers on . Meantime Mrs. de Barral , expecting him every day , lived at the Priory , with a carriage and pair , a governess for the child and many servants . The village people would see her through the railings wandering under the trees with her little girl lost in her strange surroundings . Nobody ever came near her . And there she died as some faithful and delicate animals die -- from neglect , absolutely from neglect , rather unexpectedly and without any fuss . The village was sorry for her because , though obviously worried about something , she was good to the poor and was always ready for a chat with any of the humble folks . Of course they knew that she was n't a lady -- not what you would call a real lady . And even her acquaintance with Miss Anthony was only a cottage-door , a village-street acquaintance . Carleon Anthony was a tremendous aristocrat ( his father had been a `` restoring '' architect ) and his daughter was not allowed to associate with anyone but the county young ladies . Nevertheless in defiance of the poet 's wrathful concern for undefiled refinement there were some quiet , melancholy strolls to and fro in the great avenue of chestnuts leading to the park-gate , during which Mrs. de Barral came to call Miss Anthony 'my dear ' -- and even 'my poor dear . ' The lonely soul had no one to talk to but that not very happy girl . The governess despised her . The housekeeper was distant in her manner . Moreover Mrs. de Barral was no foolish gossiping woman . But she made some confidences to Miss Anthony . Such wealth was a terrific thing to have thrust upon one she affirmed . Once she went so far as to confess that she was dying with anxiety . Mr. de Barral ( so she referred to him ) had been an excellent husband and an exemplary father but `` you see my dear I have had a great experience of him . I am sure he wo n't know what to do with all that money people are giving to him to take care of for them . He 's as likely as not to do something rash . When he comes here I must have a good long serious talk with him , like the talks we often used to have together in the good old times of our life . '' And then one day a cry of anguish was wrung from her : 'My dear , he will never come here , he will never , never come ! ' She was wrong . He came to the funeral , was extremely cut up , and holding the child tightly by the hand wept bitterly at the side of the grave . Miss Anthony , at the cost of a whole week of sneers and abuse from the poet , saw it all with her own eyes . De Barral clung to the child like a drowning man . He managed , though , to catch the half-past five fast train , travelling to town alone in a reserved compartment , with all the blinds down . . . `` `` Leaving the child ? '' I said interrogatively . `` Yes . Leaving . . . He shirked the problem . He was born that way . He had no idea what to do with her or for that matter with anything or anybody including himself . He bolted back to his suite of rooms in the hotel . He was the most helpless . . . She might have been left in the Priory to the end of time had not the high-toned governess threatened to send in her resignation . She did n't care for the child a bit , and the lonely , gloomy Priory had got on her nerves . She was n't going to put up with such a life and , having just come out of some ducal family , she bullied de Barral in a very lofty fashion . To pacify her he took a splendidly furnished house in the most expensive part of Brighton for them , and now and then ran down for a week-end , with a trunk full of exquisite sweets and with his hat full of money . The governess spent it for him in extra ducal style . She was nearly forty and harboured a secret taste for patronizing young men of sorts -- of a certain sort . But of that Mrs. Fyne of course had no personal knowledge then ; she told me however that even in the Priory days she had suspected her of being an artificial , heartless , vulgar-minded woman with the lowest possible ideals . But de Barral did not know it . He literally did not know anything . . . `` `` But tell me , Marlow , '' I interrupted , `` how do you account for this opinion ? He must have been a personality in a sense -- in some one sense surely . You do n't work the greatest material havoc of a decade at least , in a commercial community , without having something in you . '' Marlow shook his head . `` He was a mere sign , a portent . There was nothing in him . Just about that time the word Thrift was to the fore . You know the power of words . We pass through periods dominated by this or that word -- it may be development , or it may be competition , or education , or purity or efficiency or even sanctity . It is the word of the time . Well just then it was the word Thrift which was out in the streets walking arm in arm with righteousness , the inseparable companion and backer up of all such national catch-words , looking everybody in the eye as it were . The very drabs of the pavement , poor things , did n't escape the fascination . . . However ! . . . Well the greatest portion of the press were screeching in all possible tones , like a confounded company of parrots instructed by some devil with a taste for practical jokes , that the financier de Barral was helping the great moral evolution of our character towards the newly- discovered virtue of Thrift . He was helping it by all these great establishments of his , which made the moral merits of Thrift manifest to the most callous hearts , simply by promising to pay ten per cent . interest on all deposits . And you did n't want necessarily to belong to the well-to-do classes in order to participate in the advantages of virtue . If you had but a spare sixpence in the world and went and gave it to de Barral it was Thrift ! It 's quite likely that he himself believed it . He must have . It 's inconceivable that he alone should stand out against the infatuation of the whole world . He had n't enough intelligence for that . But to look at him one could n't tell . . . `` `` You did see him then ? '' I said with some curiosity . `` I did . Strange , is n't it ? It was only once , but as I sat with the distressed Fyne who had suddenly resuscitated his name buried in my memory with other dead labels of the past , I may say I saw him again , I saw him with great vividness of recollection , as he appeared in the days of his glory or splendour . No ! Neither of these words will fit his success . There was never any glory or splendour about that figure . Well , let us say in the days when he was , according to the majority of the daily press , a financial force working for the improvement of the character of the people . I 'll tell you how it came about . At that time I used to know a podgy , wealthy , bald little man having chambers in the Albany ; a financier too , in his way , carrying out transactions of an intimate nature and of no moral character ; mostly with young men of birth and expectations -- though I dare say he did n't withhold his ministrations from elderly plebeians either . He was a true democrat ; he would have done business ( a sharp kind of business ) with the devil himself . Everything was fly that came into his web . He received the applicants in an alert , jovial fashion which was quite surprising . It gave relief without giving too much confidence , which was just as well perhaps . His business was transacted in an apartment furnished like a drawing-room , the walls hung with several brown , heavily-framed , oil paintings . I do n't know if they were good , but they were big , and with their elaborate , tarnished gilt-frames had a melancholy dignity . The man himself sat at a shining , inlaid writing table which looked like a rare piece from a museum of art ; his chair had a high , oval , carved back , upholstered in faded tapestry ; and these objects made of the costly black Havana cigar , which he rolled incessantly from the middle to the left corner of his mouth and back again , an inexpressibly cheap and nasty object . I had to see him several times in the interest of a poor devil so unlucky that he did n't even have a more competent friend than myself to speak for him at a very difficult time in his life . I do n't know at what hour my private financier began his day , but he used to give one appointments at unheard of times : such as a quarter to eight in the morning , for instance . On arriving one found him busy at that marvellous writing table , looking very fresh and alert , exhaling a faint fragrance of scented soap and with the cigar already well alight . You may believe that I entered on my mission with many unpleasant forebodings ; but there was in that fat , admirably washed , little man such a profound contempt for mankind that it amounted to a species of good nature ; which , unlike the milk of genuine kindness , was never in danger of turning sour . Then , once , during a pause in business , while we were waiting for the production of a document for which he had sent ( perhaps to the cellar ? ) I happened to remark , glancing round the room , that I had never seen so many fine things assembled together out of a collection . Whether this was unconscious diplomacy on my part , or not , I shouldn't like to say -- but the remark was true enough , and it pleased him extremely . `` It _is_ a collection , '' he said emphatically . `` Only I live right in it , which most collectors do n't . But I see that you know what you are looking at . Not many people who come here on business do . Stable fittings are more in their way . '' I do n't know whether my appreciation helped to advance my friend's business but at any rate it helped our intercourse . He treated me with a shade of familiarity as one of the initiated . The last time I called on him to conclude the transaction we were interrupted by a person , something like a cross between a bookmaker and a private secretary , who , entering through a door which was not the anteroom door , walked up and stooped to whisper into his ear . `` Eh ? What ? Who , did you say ? '' The nondescript person stooped and whispered again , adding a little louder : `` Says he wo n't detain you a moment . '' My little man glanced at me , said `` Ah ! Well , '' irresolutely . I got up from my chair and offered to come again later . He looked whimsically alarmed . `` No , no . It 's bad enough to lose my money but I do n't want to waste any more of my time over your friend . We must be done with this to- day . Just go and have a look at that _garniture de cheminee_ yonder . There 's another , something like it , in the castle of Laeken , but mine's much superior in design . '' I moved accordingly to the other side of that big room . The _garniture_ was very fine . But while pretending to examine it I watched my man going forward to meet a tall visitor , who said , `` I thought you would be disengaged so early . It 's only a word or two '' -- and after a whispered confabulation of no more than a minute , reconduct him to the door and shake hands ceremoniously . `` Not at all , not at all . Very pleased to be of use . You can depend absolutely on my information '' -- '' Oh thank you , thank you . I just looked in . '' `` Certainly , quite right . Any time . . . Good morning . '' I had a good look at the visitor while they were exchanging these civilities . He was clad in black . I remember perfectly that he wore a flat , broad , black satin tie in which was stuck a large cameo pin ; and a small turn down collar . His hair , discoloured and silky , curled slightly over his ears . His cheeks were hairless and round , and apparently soft . He held himself very upright , walked with small steps and spoke gently in an inward voice . Perhaps from contrast with the magnificent polish of the room and the neatness of its owner , he struck me as dingy , indigent , and , if not exactly humble , then much subdued by evil fortune . I wondered greatly at my fat little financier 's civility to that dubious personage when he asked me , as we resumed our respective seats , whether I knew who it was that had just gone out . On my shaking my head negatively he smiled queerly , said `` De Barral , '' and enjoyed my surprise . Then becoming grave : `` That 's a deep fellow , if you like . We all know where he started from and where he got to ; but nobody knows what he means to do . '' He became thoughtful for a moment and added as if speaking to himself , `` I wonder what his game is . '' And , you know , there was no game , no game of any sort , or shape or kind . It came out plainly at the trial . As I 've told you before , he was a clerk in a bank , like thousands of others . He got that berth as a second start in life and there he stuck again , giving perfect satisfaction . Then one day as though a supernatural voice had whispered into his ear or some invisible fly had stung him , he put on his hat , went out into the street and began advertising . That 's absolutely all that there was to it . He caught in the street the word of the time and harnessed it to his preposterous chariot . One remembers his first modest advertisements headed with the magic word Thrift , Thrift , Thrift , thrice repeated ; promising ten per cent . on all deposits and giving the address of the Thrift and Independence Aid Association in Vauxhall Bridge Road . Apparently nothing more was necessary . He did n't even explain what he meant to do with the money he asked the public to pour into his lap . Of course he meant to lend it out at high rates of interest . He did so -- but he did it without system , plan , foresight or judgment . And as he frittered away the sums that flowed in , he advertised for more -- and got it . During a period of general business prosperity he set up The Orb Bank and The Sceptre Trust , simply , it seems for advertising purposes . They were mere names . He was totally unable to organize anything , to promote any sort of enterprise if it were only for the purpose of juggling with the shares . At that time he could have had for the asking any number of Dukes , retired Generals , active M.P . 's , ex-ambassadors and so on as Directors to sit at the wildest boards of his invention . But he never tried . He had no real imagination . All he could do was to publish more advertisements and open more branch offices of the Thrift and Independence , of The Orb , of The Sceptre , for the receipt of deposits ; first in this town , then in that town , north and south -- everywhere where he could find suitable premises at a moderate rent . For this was the great characteristic of the management . Modesty , moderation , simplicity . Neither The Orb nor The Sceptre nor yet their parent the Thrift and Independence had built for themselves the usual palaces . For this abstention they were praised in silly public prints as illustrating in their management the principle of Thrift for which they were founded . The fact is that de Barral simply did n't think of it . Of course he had soon moved from Vauxhall Bridge Road . He knew enough for that . What he got hold of next was an old , enormous , rat-infested brick house in a small street off the Strand . Strangers were taken in front of the meanest possible , begrimed , yellowy , flat brick wall , with two rows of unadorned window-holes one above the other , and were exhorted with bated breath to behold and admire the simplicity of the head-quarters of the great financial force of the day . The word THRIFT perched right up on the roof in giant gilt letters , and two enormous shield-like brass-plates curved round the corners on each side of the doorway were the only shining spots in de Barral 's business outfit . Nobody knew what operations were carried on inside except this -- that if you walked in and tendered your money over the counter it would be calmly taken from you by somebody who would give you a printed receipt . That and no more . It appears that such knowledge is irresistible . People went in and tendered ; and once it was taken from their hands their money was more irretrievably gone from them than if they had thrown it into the sea . This then , and nothing else was being carried on in there . . . `` `` Come , Marlow , '' I said , `` you exaggerate surely -- if only by your way of putting things . It 's too startling . '' `` I exaggerate ! '' he defended himself . `` My way of putting things ! My dear fellow I have merely stripped the rags of business verbiage and financial jargon off my statements . And you are startled ! I am giving you the naked truth . It 's true too that nothing lays itself open to the charge of exaggeration more than the language of naked truth . What comes with a shock is admitted with difficulty . But what will you say to the end of his career ? It was of course sensational and tolerably sudden . It began with the Orb Deposit Bank . Under the name of that institution de Barral with the frantic obstinacy of an unimaginative man had been financing an Indian prince who was prosecuting a claim for immense sums of money against the government . It was an enormous number of scores of lakhs -- a miserable remnant of his ancestors ' treasures -- that sort of thing . And it was all authentic enough . There was a real prince ; and the claim too was sufficiently real -- only unfortunately it was not a valid claim . So the prince lost his case on the last appeal and the beginning of de Barral's end became manifest to the public in the shape of a half-sheet of note paper wafered by the four corners on the closed door of The Orb offices notifying that payment was stopped at that establishment . Its consort The Sceptre collapsed within the week . I wo n't say in American parlance that suddenly the bottom fell out of the whole of de Barral concerns . There never had been any bottom to it . It was like the cask of Danaides into which the public had been pleased to pour its deposits . That they were gone was clear ; and the bankruptcy proceedings which followed were like a sinister farce , bursts of laughter in a setting of mute anguish -- that of the depositors ; hundreds of thousands of them . The laughter was irresistible ; the accompaniment of the bankrupt's public examination . I do n't know if it was from utter lack of all imagination or from the possession in undue proportion of a particular kind of it , or from both -- and the three alternatives are possible -- but it was discovered that this man who had been raised to such a height by the credulity of the public was himself more gullible than any of his depositors . He had been the prey of all sorts of swindlers , adventurers , visionaries and even lunatics . Wrapping himself up in deep and imbecile secrecy he had gone in for the most fantastic schemes : a harbour and docks on the coast of Patagonia , quarries in Labrador -- such like speculations . Fisheries to feed a canning Factory on the banks of the Amazon was one of them . A principality to be bought in Madagascar was another . As the grotesque details of these incredible transactions came out one by one ripples of laughter ran over the closely packed court -- each one a little louder than the other . The audience ended by fairly roaring under the cumulative effect of absurdity . The Registrar laughed , the barristers laughed , the reporters laughed , the serried ranks of the miserable depositors watching anxiously every word , laughed like one man . They laughed hysterically -- the poor wretches -- on the verge of tears . There was only one person who remained unmoved . It was de Barral himself . He preserved his serene , gentle expression , I am told ( for I have not witnessed those scenes myself ) , and looked around at the people with an air of placid sufficiency which was the first hint to the world of the man 's overweening , unmeasurable conceit , hidden hitherto under a diffident manner . It could be seen too in his dogged assertion that if he had been given enough time and a lot more money everything would have come right . And there were some people ( yes , amongst his very victims ) who more than half believed him , even after the criminal prosecution which soon followed . When placed in the dock he lost his steadiness as if some sustaining illusion had gone to pieces within him suddenly . He ceased to be himself in manner completely , and even in disposition , in so far that his faded neutral eyes matching his discoloured hair so well , were discovered then to be capable of expressing a sort of underhand hate . He was at first defiant , then insolent , then broke down and burst into tears ; but it might have been from rage . Then he calmed down , returned to his soft manner of speech and to that unassuming quiet bearing which had been usual with him even in his greatest days . But it seemed as though in this moment of change he had at last perceived what a power he had been ; for he remarked to one of the prosecuting counsel who had assumed a lofty moral tone in questioning him , that -- yes , he had gambled -- he liked cards . But that only a year ago a host of smart people would have been only too pleased to take a hand at cards with him . Yes -- he went on -- some of the very people who were there accommodated with seats on the bench ; and turning upon the counsel `` You yourself as well , '' he cried . He could have had half the town at his rooms to fawn upon him if he had cared for that sort of thing . `` Why , now I think of it , it took me most of my time to keep people , just of your sort , off me , '' he ended with a good humoured -- quite unobtrusive , contempt , as though the fact had dawned upon him for the first time . This was the moment , the only moment , when he had perhaps all the audience in Court with him , in a hush of dreary silence . And then the dreary proceedings were resumed . For all the outside excitement it was the most dreary of all celebrated trials . The bankruptcy proceedings had exhausted all the laughter there was in it . Only the fact of wide-spread ruin remained , and the resentment of a mass of people for having been fooled by means too simple to save their self-respect from a deep wound which the cleverness of a consummate scoundrel would not have inflicted . A shamefaced amazement attended these proceedings in which de Barral was not being exposed alone . For himself his only cry was : Time ! Time ! Time would have set everything right . In time some of these speculations of his were certain to have succeeded . He repeated this defence , this excuse , this confession of faith , with wearisome iteration . Everything he had done or left undone had been to gain time . He had hypnotized himself with the word . Sometimes , I am told , his appearance was ecstatic , his motionless pale eyes seemed to be gazing down the vista of future ages . Time -- and of course , more money . `` Ah ! If only you had left me alone for a couple of years more , '' he cried once in accents of passionate belief . `` The money was coming in all right . '' The deposits you understand -- the savings of Thrift . Oh yes they had been coming in to the very last moment . And he regretted them . He had arrived to regard them as his own by a sort of mystical persuasion . And yet it was a perfectly true cry , when he turned once more on the counsel who was beginning a question with the words `` You have had all these immense sums . . . `` with the indignant retort `` _What_ have I had out of them ? '' `` It was perfectly true . He had had nothing out of them -- nothing of the prestigious or the desirable things of the earth , craved for by predatory natures . He had gratified no tastes , had known no luxury ; he had built no gorgeous palaces , had formed no splendid galleries out of these '' immense sums . '' He had not even a home . He had gone into these rooms in an hotel and had stuck there for years , giving no doubt perfect satisfaction to the management . They had twice raised his rent to show I suppose their high sense of his distinguished patronage . He had bought for himself out of all the wealth streaming through his fingers neither adulation nor love , neither splendour nor comfort . There was something perfect in his consistent mediocrity . His very vanity seemed to miss the gratification of even the mere show of power . In the days when he was most fully in the public eye the invincible obscurity of his origins clung to him like a shadowy garment . He had handled millions without ever enjoying anything of what is counted as precious in the community of men , because he had neither the brutality of temperament nor the fineness of mind to make him desire them with the will power of a masterful adventurer . . . `` `` You seem to have studied the man , '' I observed . `` Studied , '' repeated Marlow thoughtfully . `` No ! Not studied . I had no opportunities . You know that I saw him only on that one occasion I told you of . But it may be that a glimpse and no more is the proper way of seeing an individuality ; and de Barral was that , in virtue of his very deficiencies for they made of him something quite unlike one's preconceived ideas . There were also very few materials accessible to a man like me to form a judgment from . But in such a case I verify believe that a little is as good as a feast -- perhaps better . If one has a taste for that kind of thing the merest starting-point becomes a coign of vantage , and then by a series of logically deducted verisimilitudes one arrives at truth -- or very near the truth -- as near as any circumstantial evidence can do . I have not studied de Barral but that is how I understand him so far as he could be understood through the din of the crash ; the wailing and gnashing of teeth , the newspaper contents bills , '' The Thrift Frauds . Cross-examination of the accused . Extra special '' -- blazing fiercely ; the charitable appeals for the victims , the grave tones of the dailies rumbling with compassion as if they were the national bowels . All this lasted a whole week of industrious sittings . A pressman whom I knew told me `` He 's",Chance
Allan Poe,"In the internal decoration , if not in the external architecture of their residences , the English are supreme . The Italians have but little sentiment beyond marbles and colours . In France , _meliora probant , deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts to maintain those household proprieties of which , indeed , they have a delicate appreciation , or at least the elements of a proper sense . The Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy . The Scotch are _poor _decorists . The Dutch have , perhaps , an indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage . In Spain they are _all _curtains—a nation of hangmen . The Russians do not furnish . The Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way . The Yankees alone are preposterous . How this happens , it is not difficult to see . We have no aristocracy of blood , and having therefore as a natural , and indeed as an inevitable thing , fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars , the _display of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the heraldic display in monarchical countries . By a transition readily understood , and which might have been as readily foreseen , we have been brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself . To speak less abstractly . In England , for example , no mere parade of costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us , to create an impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or of taste as regards the proprietor : —this for the reason , first , that wealth is not , in England , the loftiest object of ambition as constituting a nobility ; and secondly , that there , the true nobility of blood , confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste , rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted . The people _will _imitate the nobles , and the result is a thorough diffusion of the proper feeling . But in America , the coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy , their display may be said , in general , to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction ; and the populace , looking always upward for models , are insensibly led to confound the two entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty . In short , the cost of an article of furniture has at length come to be , with us , nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test , once established , has led the way to many analogous errors , readily traceable to the one primitive folly . There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to say , in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment . Its most usual defect is a want of keeping . We speak of the keeping of a room as we would of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art ; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a painting , suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber . A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several pieces of furniture , but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic arrangement . Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles . If curved lines occur , they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity . By undue precision , the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled . Curtains are rarely well disposed , or well chosen in respect to other decorations . With formal furniture , curtains are out of place ; and an extensive volume of drapery of any kind is , under any circumstance , irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum , as well as the proper adjustment , depending upon the character of the general effect . Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days , but we still very frequently err in their patterns and colours . The soul of the apartment is the carpet . From it are deduced not only the hues but the forms of all objects incumbent . A judge at common law may be an ordinary man ; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius . Yet we have heard discoursing of carpets , with the air “ _d ’ un mouton qui reve , ” _fellows who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their own _moustaches . _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have a covering of large figures , and that a small one must have a covering of small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world . As regards texture , the Saxony is alone admissible . Brussels is the preterpluperfect tense of fashion , and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies . Touching pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree Indian—all red chalk , yellow ochre , and cock ’ s feathers . In brief—distinct grounds , and vivid circular or cycloid figures , _of no meaning , _are here Median laws . The abomination of flowers , or representations of well-known objects of any kind , should not be endured within the limits of Christendom . Indeed , whether on carpets , or curtains , or tapestry , or ottoman coverings , all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly Arabesque . As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge , sprawling , and radiating devises , stripe-interspersed , and glorious with all hues , among which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and worshippers of Mammon—Benthams , who , to spare thought and economize fancy , first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope , and then established joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam . _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of taste just specified. , We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass . The former is totally inadmissible within doors . Its harsh and unsteady light offends . No one having both brains and eyes will use it . A mild , or what artists term a cool light , with its consequent warm shadows , will do wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment . Never was a more lovely thought than that of the astral lamp . We mean , of course , the astral lamp proper—the lamp of Argand , with its original plain ground-glass shade , and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays . The cut-glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy . The eagerness with which we have adopted it , partly on account of its _flashiness , _ but principally on account of its _greater rest , _ is a good commentary on the proposition with which we began . It is not too much to say , that the deliberate employer of a cut-glass shade , is either radically deficient in taste , or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion . The light proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken , and painful . It alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence . Female loveliness , in especial , is more than one-half disenchanted beneath its evil eye . In the matter of glass , generally , we proceed upon false principles . Its leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of all that is detestable do we express ! Flickering , unquiet lights , are _sometimes _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided . In truth , even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible . The huge and unmeaning glass chandeliers , prism-cut , gas-lighted , and without shade , which dangle in our most fashionable drawing-rooms , may be cited as the quintessence of all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly . The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before observed , confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has led us , also , to the exaggerated employment of mirrors . We line our dwellings with great British plates , and then imagine we have done a fine thing . Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one who has an eye at all , of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses , and especially of large ones . Regarded apart from its reflection , the mirror presents a continuous , flat , colourless , unrelieved surface , —a thing always and obviously unpleasant . Considered as a reflector , it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity : and the evil is here aggravated , not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its sources , but in a ratio constantly increasing . In fact , a room with four or five mirrors arranged at random , is , for all purposes of artistic show , a room of no shape at all . If we add to this evil , the attendant glitter upon glitter , we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing effects . The veriest bumpkin , on entering an apartment so bedizzened , would be instantly aware of something wrong , although he might be altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction . But let the same person be led into a room tastefully furnished , and he would be startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise . It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions , that here a man of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it . The corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture . As we grow rich , our ideas grow rusty . It is , therefore , not among _our _aristocracy that we must look ( if at all , in Appallachia ) , for the spirituality of a British _boudoir . _But we have seen apartments in the tenure of Americans of moderns [ possibly “ modest ” or “ moderate ” ] means , which , in negative merit at least , might vie with any of the _or-molu ’ d _cabinets of our friends across the water . Even _now_ , there is present to our mind ’ s eye a small and not , ostentatious chamber with whose decorations no fault can be found . The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the weather is cool—the time is near midnight : we will make a sketch of the room during his slumber . It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a shape affording the best ( ordinary ) opportunities for the adjustment of furniture . It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is at one end of the parallelogram , and but two windows , which are at the other . These latter are large , reaching down to the floor—have deep recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda . _Their panes are of a crimson-tinted glass , set in rose-wood framings , more massive than usual . They are curtained within the recess , by a thick silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window , and hanging loosely in small volumes . Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk , fringed with a deep network of gold , and lined with silver tissue , which is the material of the exterior blind . There are no cornices ; but the folds of the whole fabric ( which are sharp rather than massive , and have an airy appearance ) , issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork , which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls . The drapery is thrown open also , or closed , by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping it , and resolving itself readily into a knot ; no pins or other such devices are apparent . The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion , and determine the _character _of the room . The carpet—of Saxony material—is quite half an inch thick , and is of the same crimson ground , relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord ( like that festooning the curtains ) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground , _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other . The walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint , spotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson . Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper . These are chiefly landscapes of an imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield , or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman . There are , nevertheless , three or four female heads , of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully . The tone of each picture is warm , but dark . There are no “ brilliant effects. ” _Repose _speaks in all . Not one is of small size . Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room , which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched . The frames are broad but not deep , and richly carved , without being _dulled _or filagreed . They have the whole lustre of burnished gold . They lie flat on the walls , and do not hang off with cords . The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this latter position , but the general appearance of the chamber is injured . But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is visible . In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the room . Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk , gold-flowered , form the only seats , with the exception of two light conversation chairs , also of rose-wood . There is a pianoforte ( rose-wood , also ) , without cover , and thrown open . An octagonal table , formed altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble , is placed near one of the sofas . This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has been thought sufficient .. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases , in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers , occupy the slightly rounded angles of the room . A tall candelabrum , bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed oil , is standing near the head of my sleeping friend . Some light and graceful hanging shelves , with golden edges and crimson silk cords with gold tassels , sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound books . Beyond these things , there is no furniture , if we except an Argand lamp , with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade , which depends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain , and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all . A TALE OF JERUSALEM Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos Passus erat—— —Lucan—_De Catone_ ——a bristly _bore_ . _Translation._ “ Let us hurry to the walls , ” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon the Pharisee , on the tenth day of the month Thammuz , in the year of the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one— “ let us hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin , which is in the city of David , and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised ; for it is the last hour of the fourth watch , being sunrise ; and the idolaters , in fulfilment of the promise of Pompey , should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices. ” Simeon , Abel-Phittim , and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim , or sub-collectors of the offering , in the holy city of Jerusalem . “ Verily , ” replied the Pharisee ; “ let us hasten : for this generosity in the heathen is unwonted ; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of the worshippers of Baal. ” “ That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the Pentateuch , ” said Buzi-Ben-Levi , “ but that is only toward the people of Adonai . When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their own interests ? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the Lord , receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head ! ” “ Thou forgettest , however , Ben-Levi , ” replied Abel-Phittim , “ that the Roman Pompey , who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High , has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar , to the sustenance of the body , rather than of the spirit. ” “ Now , by the five corners of my beard ! ” shouted the Pharisee , who belonged to the sect called The Dashers ( that little knot of saints whose manner of _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less gifted perambulators ) — “ by the five corners of that beard which , as a priest , I am forbidden to shave ! —have we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements ? Have we lived to see the day when— ” “ Let us not question the motives of the Philistine , ” interrupted Abel-Phittim , “ for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or by his generosity ; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts , lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not extinguish , and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside. ” That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened , and which bore the name of its architect , King David , was esteemed the most strongly fortified district of Jerusalem ; being situated upon the steep and lofty hill of Zion . Here , a broad , deep , circumvallatory trench , hewn from the solid rock , was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge . This wall was adorned , at regular interspaces , by square towers of white marble ; the lowest sixty , and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height . But , in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin , the wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse . On the contrary , between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits , forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah . So that when Simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem , and the usual place of conference with the besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops , and , by several , that of the temple of Belus . “ Verily , ” sighed the Pharisee , as he peered dizzily over the precipice , “ the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the wilderness ! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin. ” “ And yet , ” added Ben-Levi , “ thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no , not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod ! ” “ Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver ! ” here shouted a Roman soldier in a hoarse , rough voice , which appeared to issue from the regions of Pluto— “ lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce ! Is it thus you evince your gratitude to our master Pompeius , who , in his condescension , has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities ? The god Phœbus , who is a true god , has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the ramparts by sunrise ? Ædepol ! do you think that we , the conquerors of the world , have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every kennel , to traffic with the dogs of the earth ? Lower away ! I say—and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight ! ” “ El Elohim ! ” ejaculated the Pharisee , as the discordant tones of the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice , and fainted away against the temple— “ El Elohim ! —who is the god Phœbus ? —whom doth the blasphemer invoke ? Thou , Buzi-Ben-Levi ! who art read in the laws of the Gentiles , and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim ! —is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh ? —or Ashimah ? —or Nibhaz , —or Tartak ? —or Adramalech ? —or Anamalech ? —or Succoth-Benith ? —or Dagon ? —or Belial ? —or Baal-Perith ? —or Baal-Peor ? —or Baal-Zebub ? ” “ Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too rapidly through thy fingers ; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on the projection of yonder crag , there will be a woful outpouring of the holy things of the sanctuary. ” By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery , the heavily laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude ; and , from the giddy pinnacle , the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it ; but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog , no distinct view of their operations could be obtained . Half an hour had already elapsed . “ We shall be too late ! ” sighed the Pharisee , as at the expiration of this period he looked over into the abyss— “ we shall be too late ! we shall be turned out of office by the Katholim. ” “ No more , ” responded Abel-Phittim— “ no more shall we feast upon the fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple. ” “ Raca ! ” swore Ben-Levi , “ Raca ! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase money ? or , Holy Moses ! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle ? ” “ They have given the signal at last ! ” cried the Pharisee— “ they have given the signal at last ! pull away , Abel-Phittim ! —and thou , Buzi-Ben-Levi , pull away ! —for verily the Philistines have either still hold upon the basket , or the Lord hath softened their hearts to place therein a beast of good weight ! ” And the Gizbarim pulled away , while their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist . “ Booshoh he ! ” —as , at the conclusion of an hour , some object at the extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible— “ Booshoh he ! ” was the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi . “ Booshoh he ! —for shame ! —it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi , and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat ! ” “ It is a firstling of the flock , ” said Abel-Phittim , “ I know him by the bleating of his lips , and the innocent folding of his limbs . His eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral , and his flesh is like the honey of Hebron. ” “ It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan , ” said the Pharisee , “ the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut ! ” It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size . “ Now El Emanu ! ” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio , as , letting go their hold , the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the Philistines , “ El Emanu ! —God be with us—it is _the unutterable flesh ! ” _ THE SPHINX During the dread reign of the cholera in New York , I had accepted the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson . We had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement ; and what with rambling in the woods , sketching , boating , fishing , bathing , music , and books , we should have passed the time pleasantly enough , but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city . Not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance . Then as the fatality increased , we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend . At length we trembled at the approach of every messenger . The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death . That palsying thought , indeed , took entire possession of my soul . I could neither speak , think , nor dream of any thing else . My host was of a less excitable temperament , and , although greatly depressed in spirits , exerted himself to sustain my own . His richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities . To the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive , but of its shadows he had no apprehension . His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which I had fallen , were frustrated , in great measure , by certain volumes which I had found in his library . These were of a character to force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my bosom . I had been reading these books without his knowledge , and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been made upon my fancy . A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief which , at this one epoch of my life , I was almost seriously disposed to defend . On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters , —I contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity—that is to say , without apparent traces of suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth , and was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius . The fact is , that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable , and which had in it so much of the portentous character , that I might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen . It appalled , and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me , that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend . Near the close of exceedingly warm day , I was sitting , book in hand , at an open window , commanding , through a long vista of the river banks , a view of a distant hill , the face of which nearest my position had been denuded by what is termed a land-slide , of the principal portion of its trees . My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city . Uplifting my eyes from the page , they fell upon the naked face of the bill , and upon an object—upon some living monster of hideous conformation , which very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom , disappearing finally in the dense forest below . As this creature first came in sight , I doubted my own sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes ; and many minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor in a dream . Yet when I described the monster ( which I distinctly saw , and calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress ) , my readers , I fear , will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even I did myself . Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence . I say ship of the line , because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline . The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length , and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant . Near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes ; and projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally , sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar , but of infinitely greater dimensions . Extending forward , parallel with the proboscis , and on each side of it , was a gigantic staff , thirty or forty feet in length , formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prism , —it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun . The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth . From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above the other , and all thickly covered with metal scales ; each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter . I observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain . But the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death ’ s Head , which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast , and which was as accurately traced in glaring white , upon the dark ground of the body , as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist . While I regarded the terrific animal , and more especially the appearance on its breast , with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming evil , which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason , I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves , and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of woe , that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill , I fell at once , fainting , to the floor . Upon recovering , my first impulse , of course , was to inform my friend of what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of repugnance it was which , in the end , operated to prevent me . At length , one evening , some three or four days after the occurrence , we were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I occupying the same seat at the same window , and he lounging on a sofa near at hand . The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon . He heard me to the end—at first laughed heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor , as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion . At this instant I again had a distinct view of the monster—to which , with a shout of absolute terror , I now directed his attention . He looked eagerly—but maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the course of the creature , as it made its way down the naked face of the hill . I was now immeasurably alarmed , for I considered the vision either as an omen of my death , or , worse , as the fore-runner of an attack of mania . I threw myself passionately back in my chair , and for some moments buried my face in my hands . When I uncovered my eyes , the apparition was no longer apparent . My host , however , had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor , and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature . When I had fully satisfied him on this head , he sighed deeply , as if relieved of some intolerable burden , and went on to talk , with what I thought a cruel calmness , of various points of speculative philosophy , which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us . I remember his insisting very especially ( among other things ) upon the idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an object , through mere misadmeasurement of its propinquity . “ To estimate properly , for example , ” he said , “ the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy , the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate . Yet can you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all ? ” He here paused for a moment , stepped to a book-case , and brought forth one of the ordinary synopses of Natural History . Requesting me then to exchange seats with him , that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume , he took my armchair at the window , and , opening the book , resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before . “ But for your exceeding minuteness , ” he said , “ in describing the monster , I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was . In the first place , let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus Sphinx , of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera , of the class of Insecta—or insects . The account runs thus : “ ‘ Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic appearance ; mouth forming a rolled proboscis , produced by an elongation of the jaws , upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi ; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair ; antennæ in the form of an elongated club , prismatic ; abdomen pointed . The Death ’ s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar , at times , by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters , and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet. ’ ” He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair , placing himself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding “ the monster. ” “ Ah , here it is , ” he presently exclaimed— “ it is reascending the face of the hill , and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be . Still , it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it , —for the fact is that , as it wriggles its way up this thread , which some spider has wrought along the window-sash , I find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length , and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye. ” HOP-FROG I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was . He seemed to live only for joking . To tell a good story of the joke kind , and to tell it well , was the surest road to his favor . Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers . They all took after the king , too , in being large , corpulent , oily men , as well as inimitable jokers . Whether people grow fat by joking , or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke , I have never been quite able to determine ; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris . About the refinements , or , as he called them , the “ ghost ” of wit , the king troubled himself very little . He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest , and would often put up with length , for the sake of it . Over-niceties wearied him . He would have preferred Rabelais ’ “ Gargantua ” to the “ Zadig ” of Voltaire : and , upon the whole , practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones . At the date of my narrative , professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court . Several of the great continental “ powers ” still retain their “ fools , ” who wore motley , with caps and bells , and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms , at a moment ’ s notice , in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table . _Our_ king , as a matter of course , retained his “ fool. ” The fact is , he _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to mention himself . His fool , or professional jester , was not only a fool , however . His value was trebled in the eyes of the king , by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple . Dwarfs were as common at court , in those days , as fools ; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days ( days are rather longer at court than elsewhere ) without both a jester to laugh with , and a dwarf to laugh at . But , as I have already observed , your jesters , in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , are fat , round , and unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that , in Hop-Frog ( this was the fool ’ s name ) , he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person . I believe the name “ Hop-Frog ” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism , but it was conferred upon him , by general consent of the seven ministers , on account of his inability to walk as other men do . In fact , Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that afforded illimitable amusement , and of course consolation , to the king , for ( notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head ) the king , by his whole court , was accounted a capital figure . But although Hop-Frog , through the distortion of his legs , could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor , the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms , by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs , enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity , where trees or ropes were in question , or any thing else to climb . At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel , or a small monkey , than a frog . I am not able to say , with precision , from what country Hop-Frog originally came . It was from some barbarous region , however , that no person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king . Hop-Frog , and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself ( although of exquisite proportions , and a marvellous dancer ) , had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces , and sent as presents to the king , by one of his ever-victorious generals . Under these circumstances , it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives . Indeed , they soon became sworn friends . Hop-Frog , who , although he made a great deal of sport , was by no means popular , had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services ; but she , on account of her grace and exquisite beauty ( although a dwarf ) , was universally admired and petted ; so she possessed much influence ; and never failed to use it , whenever she could , for the benefit of Hop-Frog . On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined to have a masquerade , and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind , occurred at our court , then the talents , both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called into play . Hop-Frog , in especial , was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants , suggesting novel characters , and arranging costumes , for masked balls , that nothing could be done , it seems , without his assistance . The night appointed for the fete had arrived . A gorgeous hall had been fitted up , under Trippetta ’ s eye , with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade . The whole court was in a fever of expectation . As for costumes and characters , it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points . Many had made up their minds ( as to what roles they should assume ) a week , or even a month , in advance ; and , in fact , there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except in the case of the king and his seven minsters . Why they hesitated I never could tell , unless they did it by way of a joke . More probably , they found it difficult , on account of being so fat , to make up their minds . At all events , time flew ; and , as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog . When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council ; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor . He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine , for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness ; and madness is no comfortable feeling . But the king loved his practical jokes , and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and ( as the king called it ) “ to be merry. ” “ Come here , Hop-Frog , ” said he , as the jester and his friend entered the room ; “ swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends , [ here Hop-Frog sighed , ] and then let us have the benefit of your invention . We want characters—characters , man—something novel—out of the way . We are wearied with this everlasting sameness . Come , drink ! the wine will brighten your wits. ” Hop-Frog endeavored , as usual , to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king ; but the effort was too much . It happened to be the poor dwarf ’ s birthday , and the command to drink to his “ absent friends ” forced the tears to his eyes . Many large , bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it , humbly , from the hand of the tyrant . “ Ah ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ” roared the latter , as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker . “ See what a glass of good wine can do ! Why , your eyes are shining already ! ” Poor fellow ! his large eyes gleamed , rather than shone ; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous . He placed the goblet nervously on the table , and looked round upon the company with a half-insane stare . They all seemed highly amused at the success of the king ’ s ‘ joke. ’ “ And now to business , ” said the prime minister , a very fat man . “ Yes , ” said the King ; “ Come , Hop-Frog , lend us your assistance . Characters , my fine fellow ; we stand in need of characters—all of us—ha ! ha ! ha ! ” and as this was seriously meant for a joke , his laugh was chorused by the seven . Hop-Frog also laughed , although feebly and somewhat vacantly . “ Come , come , ” said the king , impatiently , “ have you nothing to suggest ? ” “ I am endeavoring to think of something novel , ” replied the dwarf , abstractedly , for he was quite bewildered by the wine . “ Endeavoring ! ” cried the tyrant , fiercely ; “ what do you mean by _that ? _ Ah , I perceive . You are sulky , and want more wine . Here , drink this ! ” and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple , who merely gazed at it , gasping for breath . “ Drink , I say ! ” shouted the monster , “ or by the fiends— ” The dwarf hesitated . The king grew purple with rage . The courtiers smirked . Trippetta , pale as a corpse , advanced to the monarch ’ s seat , and , falling on her knees before him , implored him to spare her friend . The tyrant regarded her , for some moments , in evident wonder at her audacity . He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most becomingly to express his indignation . At last , without uttering a syllable , he pushed her violently from him , and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face . The poor girl got up the best she could , and , not daring even to sigh , resumed her position at the foot of the table . There was a dead silence for about half a minute , during which the falling of a leaf , or of a feather , might have been heard . It was interrupted by a low , but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room . “ What—what—what are you making that noise for ? ” demanded the king , turning furiously to the dwarf . The latter seemed to have recovered , in great measure , from his intoxication , and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant ’ s face , merely ejaculated : “ I—I ? How could it have been me ? ” “ The sound appeared to come from without , ” observed one of the courtiers . “ I fancy it was the parrot at the window , whetting his bill upon his cage-wires. ” “ True , ” replied the monarch , as if much relieved by the suggestion ; “ but , on the honor of a knight , I could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond ’ s teeth. ” Hereupon the dwarf laughed ( the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one ’ s laughing ) , and displayed a set of large , powerful , and very repulsive teeth . Moreover , he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired . The monarch was pacified ; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect , Hop-Frog entered at once , and with spirit , into the plans for the masquerade . “ I can not tell what was the association of idea , ” observed he , very tranquilly , and as if he had never tasted wine in his life , “ but just after your majesty , had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just after your majesty had done this , and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window , there came into my mind a capital diversion—one of my own country frolics—often enacted among us , at our masquerades : but here it will be new altogether . Unfortunately , however , it requires a company of eight persons and— ” “ Here we are ! ” cried the king , laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence ; “ eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers . Come ! what is the diversion ? ” “ We call it , ” replied the cripple , “ the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs , and it really is excellent sport if well enacted. ” “ We will enact it , ” remarked the king , drawing himself up , and lowering his eyelids . “ The beauty of the game , ” continued Hop-Frog , “ lies in the fright it occasions among the women. ” “ Capital ! ” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry . “ I will equip you as ourang-outangs , ” proceeded the dwarf ; “ leave all that to me . The resemblance shall be so striking , that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course , they will be as much terrified as astonished. ” “ Oh , this is exquisite ! ” exclaimed the king . “ Hop-Frog ! I will make a man of you. ” “ The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling . You are supposed to have escaped , en masse , from your keepers . Your majesty can not conceive the effect produced , at a masquerade , by eight chained ourang-outangs , imagined to be real ones by most of the company ; and rushing in with savage cries , among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women . The _contrast_ is inimitable. ” “ It must be , ” said the king : and the council arose hurriedly ( as it was growing late ) , to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog . His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple , but effective enough for his purposes . The animals in question had , at the epoch of my story , very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world ; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous , their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured . The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers . They were then saturated with tar . At this stage of the process , some one of the party suggested feathers ; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf , who soon convinced the eight , by ocular demonstration , that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by _flax_ . A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar . A long chain was now procured . First , it was passed about the waist of the king , _and tied ; _ then about another of the party , and also tied ; then about all successively , in the same manner . When this chaining arrangement was complete , and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible , they formed a circle ; and to make all things appear natural , Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters , at right angles , across the circle , after the fashion adopted , at the present day , by those who capture chimpanzees , or other large apes , in Borneo . The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place , was a circular room , very lofty , and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top . At night ( the season for which the apartment was especially designed ) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier , depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light , and lowered , or elevated , by means of a counter-balance as usual ; but ( in order not to look unsightly ) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof . The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta ’ s superintendence ; but , in some particulars , it seems , she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf . At his suggestion it was that , on this occasion , the chandelier was removed . Its waxen drippings ( which , in weather so warm , it was quite impossible to prevent ) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests , who , on account of the crowded state of the saloon , could not all be expected to keep from out its centre ; that is to say , from under the chandelier . Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall , out of the war , and a flambeau , emitting sweet odor , was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryaides [ Caryatides ] that stood against the wall—some fifty or sixty altogether . The eight ourang-outangs , taking Hop-Frog ’ s advice , waited patiently until midnight ( when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders ) before making their appearance . No sooner had the clock ceased striking , however , than they rushed , or rather rolled in , all together—for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall , and all to stumble as they entered . The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious , and filled the heart of the king with glee . As had been anticipated , there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality , if not precisely ourang-outangs . Many of the women swooned with affright ; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon , his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood . As it was , a general rush was made for the doors ; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance ; and , at the dwarf ’ s suggestion , the keys had been deposited with him . While the tumult was at its height , and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety ( for , in fact , there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd ) , the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung , and which had been drawn up on its removal , might have been seen very gradually to descend , until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor . Soon after this , the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions , found themselves , at length , in its centre , and , of course , in immediate contact with the chain . While they were thus situated , the dwarf , who had followed noiselessly at their heels , inciting them to keep up the commotion , took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles . Here , with the rapidity of thought , he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend ; and , in an instant , by some unseen agency , the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach , and , as an inevitable consequence , to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection , and face to face . The masqueraders , by this time , had recovered , in some measure , from their alarm ; and , beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry , set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes . “ Leave them to me ! ” now screamed Hop-Frog , his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din . “ Leave them to me . I fancy I know them . If I can only get a good look at them , I can soon tell who they are. ” Here , scrambling over the heads of the crowd , he managed to get to the wall ; when , seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides , he returned , as he went , to the centre of the room—leaped , with the agility of a monkey , upon the kings head , and thence clambered a few feet up the chain ; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs , and still screaming : “ I shall soon find out who they are ! ” And now , while the whole assembly ( the apes included ) were convulsed with laughter , the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle ; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs , and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor . Hop-Frog , clinging to the chain as it rose , still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers , and still ( as if nothing were the matter ) continued to thrust his torch down toward them , as though endeavoring to discover who they were . So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent , that a dead silence , of about a minute ’ s duration , ensued . It was broken by just such a low , harsh , grating sound , as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta . But , on the present occasion , there could be no question as to whence the sound issued . It came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf , who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth , and glared , with an expression of maniacal rage , into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions . “ Ah , ha ! ” said at length the infuriated jester . “ Ah , ha ! I begin to see who these people are now ! ” Here , pretending to scrutinize the king more closely , he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him , and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame . In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely , amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below , horror-stricken , and without the power to render them the slightest assistance . At length the flames , suddenly increasing in virulence , forced the jester to climb higher up the chain , to be out of their reach ; and , as he made this movement , the crowd again sank , for a brief instant , into silence . The dwarf seized his opportunity , and once more spoke : “ I now see distinctly. ” he said , “ what manner of people these maskers are . They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors , —a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage . As for myself , I am simply Hop-Frog , the jester—and this is my last jest. ” Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered , the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete . The eight corpses swung in their chains , a fetid , blackened , hideous , and indistinguishable mass . The cripple hurled his torch at them , clambered leisurely to the ceiling , and disappeared through the sky-light . It is supposed that Trippetta , stationed on the roof of the saloon , had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge , and that , together , they effected their escape to their own country ; for neither was seen again . THE MAN OF THE CROWD . Ce grand malheur , de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_ . It was well said of a certain German book that “ _er lasst sich nicht lesen_ ” —it does not permit itself to be read . There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told . Men die nightly in their beds , wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat , on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed . Now and then , alas , the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave . And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged . Not long ago , about the closing in of an evening in autumn , I sat at the large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London . For some months I had been ill in health , but was now convalescent , and , with returning strength , found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest appetency , when the film from the mental vision departs—the αχλυξ η πριυ επῆευ—and the intellect , electrified , surpasses as greatly its every-day condition , as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz , the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias . Merely to breathe was enjoyment ; and I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain . I felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing . With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap , I had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon , now in poring over advertisements , now in observing the promiscuous company in the room , and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street . This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city , and had been very much crowded during the whole day . But , as the darkness came on , the throng momently increased ; and , by the time the lamps were well lighted , two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door . At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation , and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me , therefore , with a delicious novelty of emotion . I gave up , at length , all care of things within the hotel , and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without . At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn . I looked at the passengers in masses , and thought of them in their aggregate relations . Soon , however , I descended to details , and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure , dress , air , gait , visage , and expression of countenance . By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied business-like demeanor , and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press . Their brows were knit , and their eyes rolled quickly ; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience , but adjusted their clothes and hurried on . Others , still a numerous class , were restless in their movements , had flushed faces , and talked and gesticulated to themselves , as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around . When impeded in their progress , these people suddenly ceased muttering , but re-doubled their gesticulations , and awaited , with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips , the course of the persons impeding them . If jostled , they bowed profusely to the jostlers , and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I have noted . Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent . They were undoubtedly noblemen , merchants , attorneys , tradesmen , stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own—conducting business upon their own responsibility . They did not greatly excite my attention . The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable divisions . There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young gentlemen with tight coats , bright boots , well-oiled hair , and supercilious lips . Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage , which may be termed deskism for want of a better word , the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before . They wore the cast-off graces of the gentry ; —and this , I believe , involves the best definition of the class . The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms , or of the “ steady old fellows , ” it was not possible to mistake . These were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown , made to sit comfortably , with white cravats and waistcoats , broad solid-looking shoes , and thick hose or gaiters . They had all slightly bald heads , from which the right ears , long used to pen-holding , had an odd habit of standing off on end . I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands , and wore watches , with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern . Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed there be an affectation so honorable . There were many individuals of dashing appearance , whom I easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all great cities are infested . I watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness , and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves . Their voluminousness of wristband , with an air of excessive frankness , should betray them at once . The gamblers , of whom I descried not a few , were still more easily recognisable . They wore every variety of dress , from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully , with velvet waistcoat , fancy neckerchief , gilt chains , and filagreed buttons , to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman , than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion . Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion , a filmy dimness of eye , and pallor and compression of lip . There were two other traits , moreover , by which I could always detect them : a guarded lowness of tone in conversation , and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers . Very often , in company with these sharpers , I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits , but still birds of a kindred feather . They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits . They seem to prey upon the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the military men . Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles ; of the second , frogged coats and frowns . Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility , I found darker and deeper themes for speculation . I saw Jew pedlars , with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility ; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp , whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity ; feeble and ghastly invalids , upon whom death had placed a sure hand , and who sidled and tottered through the mob , looking every one beseechingly in the face , as if in search of some chance consolation , some lost hope ; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home , and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians , whose direct contact , even , could not be avoided ; women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood , putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian , with the surface of Parian marble , and the interior filled with filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the wrinkled , bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame , making a last effort at youth—the mere child of immature form , yet , from long association , an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade , and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice ; drunkards innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches , reeling , inarticulate , with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole although filthy garments , with a slightly unsteady swagger , thick sensual lips , and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials which had once been good , and which even now were scrupulously well brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step , but whose countenances were fearfully pale , whose eyes hideously wild and red , and who clutched with quivering fingers , as they strode through the crowd , at every object which came within their reach ; beside these , pie-men , porters , coal-heavers , sweeps ; organ-grinders , monkey-exhibitors , and ballad mongers , those who vended with those who sang ; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description , and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear , and gave an aching sensation to the eye . As the night deepened , so deepened to me the interest of the scene ; for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter ( its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people , and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief , as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den , ) but the rays of the gas-lamps , feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day , had now at length gained ascendancy , and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre . All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian . The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces ; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window , prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage , still it seemed that , in my then peculiar mental state , I could frequently read , even in that brief interval of a glance , the history of long years . With my brow to the glass , I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob , when suddenly there came into view a countenance ( that of a decrepid old man , some sixty-five or seventy years of age , ) —a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention , on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression . Any thing even remotely resembling that expression I had never seen before . I well remember that my first thought , upon beholding it , was that Retzch , had he viewed it , would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend . As I endeavored , during the brief minute of my original survey , to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed , there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind , the ideas of vast mental power , of caution , of penuriousness , of avarice , of coolness , of malice , of blood thirstiness , of triumph , of merriment , of excessive terror , of intense—of supreme despair . I felt singularly aroused , startled , fascinated . “ How wild a history , ” I said to myself , “ is written within that bosom ! ” Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him . Hurriedly putting on an overcoat , and seizing my hat and cane , I made my way into the street , and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had seen him take ; for he had already disappeared . With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him , approached , and followed him closely , yet cautiously , so as not to attract his attention . I had now a good opportunity of examining his person . He was short in stature , very thin , and apparently very feeble . His clothes , generally , were filthy and ragged ; but as he came , now and then , within the strong glare of a lamp , I perceived that his linen , although dirty , was of beautiful texture ; and my vision deceived me , or , through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him , I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger . These observations heightened my curiosity , and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go . It was now fully night-fall , and a thick humid fog hung over the city , soon ending in a settled and heavy rain . This change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd , the whole of which was at once put into new commotion , and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas . The waver , the jostle , and the hum increased in a tenfold degree . For my own part I did not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant . Tying a handkerchief about my mouth , I kept on . For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare ; and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him . Never once turning his head to look back , he did not observe me . By and by he passed into a cross street , which , although densely filled with people , was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted . Here a change in his demeanor became evident . He walked more slowly and with less object than before—more hesitatingly . He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim ; and the press was still so thick that , at every such movement , I was obliged to follow him closely . The street was a narrow and long one , and his course lay within it for nearly an hour , during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city . A second turn brought us into a square , brilliantly lighted , and overflowing with life . The old manner of the stranger re-appeared . His chin fell upon his breast , while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows , in every direction , upon those who hemmed him in . He urged his way steadily and perseveringly . I was surprised , however , to find , upon his having made the circuit of the square , that he turned and retraced his steps . Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement . In this exercise he spent another hour , at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first . The rain fell fast ; the air grew cool ; and the people were retiring to their homes . With a gesture of impatience , the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively deserted . Down this , some quarter of a mile long , he rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged , and which put me to much trouble in pursuit . A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar , with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted , and where his original demeanor again became apparent , as he forced his way to and fro , without aim , among the host of buyers and sellers . During the hour and a half , or thereabouts , which we passed in this place , it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation . Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc over-shoes , and could move about in perfect silence . At no moment did he see that I watched him . He entered shop after shop , priced nothing , spoke no word , and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare . I was now utterly amazed at his behavior , and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him . A loud-toned clock struck eleven , and the company were fast deserting the bazaar . A shop-keeper , in putting up a shutter , jostled the old man , and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame . He hurried into the street , looked anxiously around him for an instant , and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes , until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the street of the D—— Hotel . It no longer wore , however , the same aspect . It was still brilliant with gas ; but the rain fell fiercely , and there were few persons to be seen . The stranger grew pale . He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue , then , with a heavy sigh , turned in the direction of the river , and , plunging through a great variety of devious ways , came out , at length , in view of one of the principal theatres . It was about being closed , and the audience were thronging from the doors . I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd ; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had , in some measure , abated . His head again fell upon his breast ; he appeared as I had seen him at first . I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but , upon the whole , I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions . As he proceeded , the company grew more scattered , and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed . For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers ; but from this number one by one dropped off , until three only remained together , in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented . The stranger paused , and , for a moment , seemed lost in thought ; then , with every mark of agitation , pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city , amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed . It was the most noisome quarter of London , where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty , and of the most desperate crime . By the dim light of an accidental lamp , tall , antique , worm-eaten , wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall , in directions so many and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them . The paving-stones lay at random , displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass . Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters . The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation . Yet , as we proceeded , the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees , and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro . The spirits of the old man again flickered up , as a lamp which is near its death hour . Once more he strode onward with elastic tread . Suddenly a corner was turned , a blaze of light burst upon our sight , and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend , Gin . It was now nearly day-break ; but a number of wretched inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance . With a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within , resumed at once his original bearing , and stalked backward and forward , without apparent object , among the throng . He had not been thus long occupied , however , before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night . It was something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously . Yet he did not hesitate in his career , but , with a mad energy , retraced his steps at once , to the heart of the mighty London . Long and swiftly he fled , while I followed him in the wildest amazement , resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing . The sun arose while we proceeded , and , when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town , the street of the D—— Hotel , it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before . And here , long , amid the momently increasing confusion , did I persist in my pursuit of the stranger . But , as usual , he walked to and fro , and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street . And , as the shades of the second evening came on , I grew wearied unto death , and , stopping fully in front of the wanderer , gazed at him steadfastly in the face . He noticed me not , but resumed his solemn walk , while I , ceasing to follow , remained absorbed in contemplation . “ This old man , ” I said at length , “ is the type and the genius of deep crime . He refuses to be alone . _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow ; for I shall learn no more of him , nor of his deeds . The worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the ‘ Hortulus Animæ , ’ { * 1 } and perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘ _er lasst sich nicht lesen._ ’ ” { * 1 } The “ _Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_ ” of Grünninger . NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD A Tale With a Moral . We presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion . Every fiction should have a moral ; and , what is more to the purpose , the critics have discovered that every fiction has . Pierre la Seine , going a step farther , shows that the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking . Just so , too , Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that , by Euenis , Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin ; by Antinous , Martin Luther ; by the Lotophagi , Protestants in general ; and , by the Harpies , the Dutch . Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute . These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “ The Antediluvians , ” a parable in Powhatan , “ new views in Cock Robin , ” and transcendentalism in “ Hop O ’ My Thumb. ” In short , it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound design . Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared . A novelist , for example , need have no care of his moral . It is there—that is to say , it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves . When the proper time arrives , all that the gentleman intended , and all that he did not intend , will be brought to light , in the “ Dial , ” or the “ Down-Easter , ” together with all that he ought to have intended , and the rest that he clearly meant to intend : —so that it will all come very straight in the end . There is no just ground , therefore , for the charge brought against me by certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale , or , in more precise words , a tale with a moral . They are not the critics predestined to bring me out , and develop my morals : —that is the secret . By and by the “ North American Quarterly Humdrum ” will make them ashamed of their stupidity . In the meantime , by way of staying execution—by way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history appended , —a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever , since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form the title of the tale . I should have credit for this arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others , who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment , and thus sneak it in at the fag end of their fables . _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables , and _De mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead in question be nothing but dead small beer . It is not my design , therefore , to vituperate my deceased friend , Toby Dammit . He was a sad dog , it is true , and a dog ’ s death it was that he died ; but he himself was not to blame for his vices . They grew out of a personal defect in his mother . She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures , and babies , like tough steaks , or the modern Greek olive trees , are invariably the better for beating—but , poor woman ! she had the misfortune to be left-handed , and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged . The world revolves from right to left . It will not do to whip a baby from left to right . If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil propensity out , it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in . I was often present at Toby ’ s chastisements , and , even by the way in which he kicked , I could perceive that he was getting worse and worse every day . At last I saw , through the tears in my eyes , that there was no hope of the villain at all , and one day when he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little African , and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit , I could stand it no longer , but went down upon my knees forthwith , and , uplifting my voice , made prophecy of his ruin . The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful . At five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate . At six months , I caught him gnawing a pack of cards . At seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies . At eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance pledge . Thus he went on increasing in iniquity , month after month , until , at the close of the first year , he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches , but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing , and for backing his assertions by bets . Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice , the ruin which I had predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last . The fashion had “ grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength , ” so that , when he came to be a man , he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to gamble . Not that he actually laid wagers—no . I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs . With him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more . His expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever . They were simple if not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence . When he said “ I ’ ll bet you so and so , ” nobody ever thought of taking him up ; but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put him down . The habit was an immoral one , and so I told him . It was a vulgar one—this I begged him to believe . It was discountenanced by society—here I said nothing but the truth . It was forbidden by act of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie . I remonstrated—but to no purpose . I demonstrated—in vain . I entreated—he smiled . I implored—he laughed . I preached—he sneered . I threatened—he swore . I kicked him—he called for the police . I pulled his nose—he blew it , and offered to bet the Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again . Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of Dammit ’ s mother had entailed upon her son . He was detestably poor , and this was the reason , no doubt , that his expletive expressions about betting , seldom took a pecuniary turn . I will not be bound to say that I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “ I ’ ll bet you a dollar. ” It was usually “ I ’ ll bet you what you please , ” or “ I ’ ll bet you what you dare , ” or “ I ’ ll bet you a trifle , ” or else , more significantly still , “ I ’ ll bet the Devil my head. ” This latter form seemed to please him best ; —perhaps because it involved the least risk ; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious . Had any one taken him up , his head was small , and thus his loss would have been small too . But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure that I am right in attributing them to him . At all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor , notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which my friend ’ s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend . In the end , he abandoned all other forms of wager , and gave himself up to “ I ’ ll bet the Devil my head , ” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me . I am always displeased by circumstances for which I can not account . Mysteries force a man to think , and so injure his health . The truth is , there was something in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which at first interested , and afterwards made me very uneasy—something which , for want of a more definite term at present , I must be permitted to call queer ; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical , Mr. Kant pantheistical , Mr. Carlyle twistical , and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical . I began not to like it at all . Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state . I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it . I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick , in the Irish chronicle , is said to have served the toad , —that is to say , “ awaken him to a sense of his situation. ” I addressed myself to the task forthwith . Once more I betook myself to remonstrance . Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at expostulation . When I had made an end of my lecture , Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior . For some moments he remained silent , merely looking me inquisitively in the face . But presently he threw his head to one side , and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent . Then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders . Then he winked with the right eye . Then he repeated the operation with the left . Then he shut them both up very tight . Then he opened them both so very wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences . Then , applying his thumb to his nose , he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers . Finally , setting his arms a-kimbo , he condescended to reply . I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse . He would be obliged to me if I would hold my tongue . He wished none of my advice . He despised all my insinuations . He was old enough to take care of himself . Did I still think him baby Dammit ? Did I mean to say any thing against his character ? Did I intend to insult him ? Was I a fool ? Was my maternal parent aware , in a word , of my absence from the domiciliary residence ? He would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity , and he would bind himself to abide by my reply . Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that I was out . My confusion , he said , betrayed me , and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not . Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder . Turning upon his heel , he left my presence with undignified precipitation . It was well for him that he did so . My feelings had been wounded . Even my anger had been aroused . For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager . I would have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit ’ s little head—for the fact is , my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home . But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans say when you tread upon their toes . It was in pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted , and I bore the insult like a man . It now seemed to me , however , that I had done all that could be required of me , in the case of this miserable individual , and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my counsel , but to leave him to his conscience and himself . But although I forebore to intrude with my advice , I could not bring myself to give up his society altogether . I even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities ; and there were times when I found myself lauding his wicked jokes , as epicures do mustard , with tears in my eyes : —so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk . One fine day , having strolled out together , arm in arm , our route led us in the direction of a river . There was a bridge , and we resolved to cross it . It was roofed over , by way of protection from the weather , and the archway , having but few windows , was thus very uncomfortably dark . As we entered the passage , the contrast between the external glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits . Not so upon those of the unhappy Dammit , who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped . He seemed to be in an unusual good humor . He was excessively lively—so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion . It is not impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals . I am not well enough versed , however , in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point ; and unhappily there were none of my friends of the “ Dial ” present . I suggest the idea , nevertheless , because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend , and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself . Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way ; now shouting out , and now lisping out , all manner of odd little and big words , yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the time . I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him . At length , having passed nearly across the bridge , we approached the termination of the footway , when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height . Through this I made my way quietly , pushing it around as usual . But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit . He insisted upon leaping the stile , and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air . Now this , conscientiously speaking , I did not think he could do . The best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle , and as I knew he could not do it , I would not believe that it could be done by Toby Dammit . I therefore told him , in so many words , that he was a braggadocio , and could not do what he said . For this I had reason to be sorry afterward ; —for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head that he could . I was about to reply , notwithstanding my previous resolutions , with some remonstrance against his impiety , when I heard , close at my elbow , a slight cough , which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ ahem ! ” I started , and looked about me in surprise . My glance at length fell into a nook of the frame—work of the bridge , and upon the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect . Nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance ; for he not only had on a full suit of black , but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat , while his hair was parted in front like a girl ’ s . His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach , and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head . Upon observing him more closely , I perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his small-clothes ; and this was a thing which I thought very odd . Before I had time to make any remark , however , upon so singular a circumstance , he interrupted me with a second “ ahem ! ” To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply . The fact is , remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable . I have known a Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “ Fudge ! ” I am not ashamed to say , therefore , that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance . “ Dammit , ” said I , “ what are you about ? don ’ t you hear ? —the gentleman says ‘ ahem ! ’ ” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him ; for , to say the truth , I felt particularly puzzled , and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage , or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool . “ Are you quite sure he said that ? Well , at all events I am in for it now , and may as well put a bold face upon the matter . Here goes , then—ahem ! ” At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why . He left his station at the nook of the bridge , limped forward with a gracious air , took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially , looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine . “ I am quite sure you will win it , Dammit , ” said he , with the frankest of all smiles , “ but we are obliged to have a trial , you know , for the sake of mere form. ” “ Ahem ! ” replied my friend , taking off his coat , with a deep sigh , tying a pocket-handkerchief around his waist , and producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouth— “ ahem ! ” And “ ahem ! ” said he again , after a pause ; and not another word more than “ ahem ! ” did I ever know him to say after that . “ Aha ! ” thought I , without expressing myself aloud— “ this is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit , and is no doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion . One extreme induces another . I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture ? At all events , he is cured of the transcendentals. ” “ Ahem ! ” here replied Toby , just as if he had been reading my thoughts , and looking like a very old sheep in a revery . The old gentleman now took him by the arm , and led him more into the shade of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile . “ My good fellow , ” said he , “ I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run . Wait here , till I take my place by the stile , so that I may see whether you go over it handsomely , and transcendentally , and don ’ t omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing . A mere form , you know . I will say ‘ one , two , three , and away. ’ Mind you , start at the word ‘ away. ’ ” Here he took his position by the stile , paused a moment as if in profound reflection , then looked up and , I thought , smiled very slightly , then tightened the strings of his apron , then took a long look at Dammit , and finally gave the word as agreed upon— _One—two—three—and—away ! _ Punctually at the word “ away , ” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop . The stile was not very high , like Mr. Lord ’ s—nor yet very low , like that of Mr. Lord ’ s reviewers , but upon the whole I made sure that he would clear it . And then what if he did not ? —ah , that was the question—what if he did not ? “ What right , ” said I , “ had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump ? The little old dot-and-carry-one ! who is he ? If he asks me to jump , I won ’ t do it , that ’ s flat , and I don ’ t care who the devil he is. ” The bridge , as I say , was arched and covered in , in a very ridiculous manner , and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last words of my remark . But what I said , or what I thought , or what I heard , occupied only an instant . In less than five seconds from his starting , my poor Toby had taken the leap . I saw him run nimbly , and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge , cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up . I saw him high in the air , pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile ; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over . But the whole leap was the affair of a moment , and , before I had a chance to make any profound reflections , down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back , on the same side of the stile from which he had started . At the same instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed , having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile . At all this I was much astonished ; but I had no leisure to think , for Dammit lay particularly still , and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt , and that he stood in need of my assistance . I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury . The truth is , he had been deprived of his head , which after a close search I could not find anywhere ; so I determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists . In the meantime a thought struck me , and I threw open an adjacent window of the bridge , when the sad truth flashed upon me at once . About five feet just above the top of the turnstile , and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace , there extended a flat iron bar , lying with its breadth horizontally , and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent . With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact . He did not long survive his terrible loss . The homœopathists did not give him little enough physic , and what little they did give him he hesitated to take . So in the end he grew worse , and at length died , a lesson to all riotous livers . I bedewed his grave with my tears , worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon , and , for the general expenses of his funeral , sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists . The scoundrels refused to pay it , so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once , and sold him for dog ’ s meat . THOU ART THE MAN I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma . I will expound to you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected the Rattleborough miracle—the one , the true , the admitted , the undisputed , the indisputable miracle , which put a definite end to infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before . This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18— . Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play . Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning , on horseback , with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of —— , about fifteen miles distant , and of returning the night of the same day . Two hours after his departure , however , his horse returned without him , and without the saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting . The animal was wounded , too , and covered with mud . These circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man ; and when it was found , on Sunday morning , that he had not yet made his appearance , the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body . The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow , or , as he was universally called , “ Charley Goodfellow , ” or “ Old Charley Goodfellow. ” Now , whether it is a marvellous coincidence , or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character , I have never yet been able to ascertain ; but the fact is unquestionable , that there never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open , manly , honest , good-natured , and frank-hearted fellow , with a rich , clear voice , that did you good to hear it , and an eye that looked you always straight in the face , as much as to say : “ I have a clear conscience myself , am afraid of no man , and am altogether above doing a mean action. ” And thus all the hearty , careless , “ walking gentlemen ” of the stage are very certain to be called Charles . Now , “ Old Charley Goodfellow , ” although he had been in Rattleborough not longer than six months or thereabouts , and although nobody knew any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood , had experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable people in the borough . Not a man of them but would have taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment ; and as for the women , there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him . And all this came of his having been christened Charles , and of his possessing , in consequence , that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “ best letter of recommendation. ” I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable and , undoubtedly , he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough , while “ Old Charley Goodfellow ” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother . The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours , and , although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom , if ever , visited “ Old Charley , ” and never was known to take a meal in his house , still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate , as I have just observed ; for “ Old Charley ” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on , and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea , and almost always to dinner , and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting , it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain . “ Old Charleys ” favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux , and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s heart good to see the old fellow swallow it , as he did , quart after quart ; so that , one day , when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence , somewhat out , he said to his crony , as he slapped him upon the back— “ I tell you what it is , ‘ Old Charley , ’ you are , by all odds , the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days ; and , since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion , I ’ ll be darned if I don ’ t have to make thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux . Od rot me , ” — ( Mr. Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing , although he seldom went beyond “ Od rot me , ” or “ By gosh , ” or “ By the jolly golly , ” ) — “ Od rot me , ” says he , “ if I don ’ t send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got , and I ’ ll make ye a present of it , I will ! —ye needn ’ t say a word now—I will , I tell ye , and there ’ s an end of it ; so look out for it—it will come to hand some of these fine days , precisely when ye are looking for it the least ! ” I mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy , just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends . Well , on the Sunday morning in question , when it came to be fairly understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play , I never saw any one so profoundly affected as “ Old Charley Goodfellow. ” When he first heard that the horse had come home without his master , and without his master ’ s saddle-bags , and all bloody from a pistol-shot , that had gone clean through and through the poor animal ’ s chest without quite killing him ; when he heard all this , he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father , and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague . At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all , or to concert upon any plan of action ; so that for a long time he endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s other friends from making a stir about the matter , thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a week or two , or a month , or two—to see if something wouldn ’ t turn up , or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn ’ t come in the natural way , and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before . I dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize , or to procrastinate , in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow . Their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid , so that they have a horror of any thing like action , and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “ nurse their grief , ” as the old ladies express it—that is to say , ruminate over the trouble . The people of Rattleborough had , indeed , so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of “ Old Charley , ” that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him , and not make a stir in the business “ until something should turn up , ” as the honest old gentleman worded it ; and I believe that , after all this would have been the general determination , but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s nephew , a young man of very dissipated habits , and otherwise of rather bad character . This nephew , whose name was Pennifeather , would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of “ lying quiet , ” but insisted upon making immediate search for the “ corpse of the murdered man. ” This was the expression he employed ; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time , that it was “ a singular expression , to say no more. ” This remark of “ Old Charley ’ s , ” too , had great effect upon the crowd ; and one of the party was heard to ask , very impressively , “ how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle ’ s disappearance , as to feel authorized to assert , distinctly and unequivocally , that his uncle was ‘ a murdered man. ’ ” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd , and especially between “ Old Charley ” and Mr. Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was , indeed , by no means a novelty , for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months ; and matters had even gone so far that Mr. Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle ’ s friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle ’ s house , of which the nephew was an inmate . Upon this occasion “ Old Charley ” is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity . He arose from the blow , adjusted his clothes , and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely muttering a few words about “ taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity , ” —a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger , which meant nothing , however , and , beyond doubt , was no sooner given vent to than forgotten . However these matters may be ( which have no reference to the point now at issue ) , it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough , principally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather , came at length to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy . I say they came to this determination in the first instance . After it had been fully resolved that a search should be made , it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should disperse—that is to say , distribute themselves in parties—for the more thorough examination of the region round about . I forget , however , by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “ Old Charley ” finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued . Convince them , however , he did—all except Mr. Pennifeather , and , in the end , it was arranged that a search should be instituted , carefully and very thoroughly , by the burghers en masse , “ Old Charley ” himself leading the way . As for the matter of that , there could have been no better pioneer than “ Old Charley , ” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx ; but , although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners , by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood , and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week , still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered . When I say no trace , however , I must not be understood to speak literally ; for trace , to some extent , there certainly was . The poor gentleman had been tracked , by his horse ’ s shoes ( which were peculiar ) , to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough , on the main road leading to the city . Here the track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path coming out again into the main road , and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance . Following the shoe-marks down this lane , the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water , half hidden by the brambles , to the right of the lane , and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of . It appeared , however , that a struggle of some nature had here taken place , and it seemed as if some large and heavy body , much larger and heavier than a man , had been drawn from the by-path to the pool . This latter was carefully dragged twice , but nothing was found ; and the party was upon the point of going away , in despair of coming to any result , when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether . This project was received with cheers , and many high compliments to “ Old Charley ” upon his sagacity and consideration . As many of the burghers had brought spades with them , supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse , the drain was easily and speedily effected ; and no sooner was the bottom visible , than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat , which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather . This waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood , and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s departure for the city ; while there were others , again , ready to testify upon oath , if required , that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day , nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P. ‘ s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s disappearance . Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather , and it was observed , as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him , that he grew exceedingly pale , and when asked what he had to say for himself , was utterly incapable of saying a word . Hereupon , the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at once to a man , and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest . But , on the other hand , the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast . He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather , in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman— “ the heir of the worthy Mr. Shuttleworthy , ” —for the insult which he ( the young gentleman ) had , no doubt in the heat of passion , thought proper to put upon him ( Mr. Goodfellow ) . “ He forgave him for it , ” he said , “ from the very bottom of his heart ; and for himself ( Mr. Goodfellow ) , so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity , which he was sorry to say , really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather , he ( Mr. Goodfellow ) would make every exertion in his power , would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to—to—to—soften down , as much as he could conscientiously do so , the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business. ” Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain , very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart ; but your warm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all sorts of blunders , contre-temps and mal apropos-isms , in the hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus , often with the kindest intentions in the world , doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it . So , in the present instance , it turned out with all the eloquence of “ Old Charley ” ; for , although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected , yet it so happened , somehow or other , that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience , had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded , and to arouse against him the fury of the mob . One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as “ the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr. Shuttleworthy. ” The people had really never thought of this before . They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle ( who had no living relative except the nephew ) , and they had , therefore , always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers ; but the remark of “ Old Charley ” brought them at once to a consideration of this point , and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat . And straightway hereupon , arose the natural question of cui bono ? —a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man . And here , lest I may be misunderstood , permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed , is invariably mistranslated and misconceived . “ Cui bono ? ” in all the crack novels and elsewhere , —in those of Mrs. Gore , for example , ( the author of “ Cecil , ” ) a lady who quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw , and is helped to her learning , “ as needed , ” upon a systematic plan , by Mr. Beckford , —in all the crack novels , I say , from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth , the two little Latin words cui bono are rendered “ to what purpose ? ” or , ( as if quo bono , ) “ to what good. ” Their true meaning , nevertheless , is “ for whose advantage. ” Cui , to whom ; bono , is it for a benefit . It is a purely legal phrase , and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration , where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed ’ s accomplishment . Now in the present instance , the question cui bono ? very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather . His uncle had threatened him , after making a will in his favour , with disinheritance . But the threat had not been actually kept ; the original will , it appeared , had not been altered . Had it been altered , the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge ; and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle . But the will being unaltered , while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew ’ s head , there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity , and so concluded , very sagaciously , the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle . Mr. Pennifeather was , accordingly , arrested upon the spot , and the crowd , after some further search , proceeded homeward , having him in custody . On the route , however , another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained . Mr. Goodfellow , whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party , was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces , stoop , and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass . Having quickly examined it he was observed , too , to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket ; but this action was noticed , as I say , and consequently prevented , when the object picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather . Moreover , his initials were engraved upon the handle . The blade of this knife was open and bloody . No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew , and immediately upon reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination . Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn . The prisoner , being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s disappearance , had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking , in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow . This latter now came forward , and , with tears in his eyes , asked permission to be examined . He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed his Maker , not less than his fellow-men , would permit him no longer to remain silent . Hitherto , the sincerest affection for the young man ( notwithstanding the latter ’ s ill-treatment of himself , Mr. Goodfellow ) had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest , by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather , but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning ; he would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew , although his heart ( Mr. Goodfellow ’ s ) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort . He then went on to state that , on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s departure for the city , that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew , in his hearing ( Mr. Goodfellow ’ s ) , that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the “ Farmers ’ and Mechanics ’ Bank , ” and that , then and there , the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made , and of cutting him off with a shilling . He ( the witness ) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he ( the witness ) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial particular . Much to the astonishment of every one present , Mr. Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was . The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle . From this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound , russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years . Its valuable contents , however , had been abstracted , and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them , or the place of their concealment . Indeed , he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter . The constables , also , discovered , between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man , a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials of his name , and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim . At this juncture , it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received , and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made , with the view , if possible , of discovering the ball . This was accordingly done ; and , as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused , Mr. Goodfellow , after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size , which , upon trial , was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather ’ s rifle , while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity . To render the matter even surer yet , however , this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture , and upon examination , this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property . Upon finding of this bullet , the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony , and immediately committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in the case , although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated , and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required . This generosity on the part of “ Old Charley ” was only in accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle . In the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy , that he seemed to have quite forgotten , when he offered to go bail for his young friend , that he himself ( Mr. Goodfellow ) did not possess a single dollar ’ s worth of property upon the face of the earth . The result of the committal may be readily foreseen . Mr. Pennifeather , amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough , was brought to trial at the next criminal sessions , when the chain of circumstantial evidence ( strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts , which Mr. Goodfellow ’ s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the court ) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive , that the jury , without leaving their seats , returned an immediate verdict of “ Guilty of murder in the first degree. ” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch received sentence of death , and was remanded to the county jail to await the inexorable vengeance of the law . In the meantime , the noble behavior of “ Old Charley Goodfellow , ” had doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough . He became ten times a greater favorite than ever , and , as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated , he relaxed , as it were , perforce , the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe , and very frequently had little reunions at his own house , when wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little , of course , by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host . One fine day , this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at the receipt of the following letter : Charles Goodfellow , Esq. , Rattleborough From H.F.B . & Co. Chat . Mar . A—No . 1.—6 doz . bottles ( 1/2 Gross ) “ Charles Goodfellow , Esquire . “ Dear Sir—In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about two months since , by our esteemed correspondent , Mr. Barnabus Shuttleworthy , we have the honor of forwarding this morning , to your address , a double box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand , violet seal . Box numbered and marked as per margin . “ We remain , sir , “ Your most ob ’ nt ser ’ ts , “ HOGGS , FROGS , BOGS , & CO. “ City of— , June 21 , 18— . “ P.S.—The box will reach you by wagon , on the day after your receipt of this letter . Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy . “ H. , F. , B. , & CO. ” The fact is , that Mr. Goodfellow had , since the death of Mr. Shuttleworthy , given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised Chateau-Margaux ; and he , therefore , looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf . He was highly delighted , of course , and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow , for the purpose of broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy ’ s present . Not that he said any thing about “ the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy ” when he issued the invitations . The fact is , he thought much and concluded to say nothing at all . He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux . He merely asked his friends to come and help him drink some , of a remarkable fine quality and rich flavour , that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago , and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow . I have often puzzled myself to imagine why it was that “ Old Charley ” came to the conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend , but I could never precisely understand his reason for the silence , although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason , no doubt . The morrow at length arrived , and with it a very large and highly respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow ’ s house . Indeed , half the borough was there , —I myself among the number , —but , much to the vexation of the host , the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour , and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “ Old Charley ” had been done very ample justice by the guests . It came at length , however , —a monstrously big box of it there was , too—and as the whole party were in excessively good humor , it was decided , nem . con. , that it should be lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith . No sooner said than done . I lent a helping hand ; and , in a trice we had the box upon the table , in the midst of all the bottles and glasses , not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle . “ Old Charley , ” who was pretty much intoxicated , and excessively red in the face , now took a seat , with an air of mock dignity , at the head of the board , and thumped furiously upon it with a decanter , calling upon the company to keep order “ during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure. ” After some vociferation , quiet was at length fully restored , and , as very often happens in similar cases , a profound and remarkable silence ensued . Being then requested to force open the lid , I complied , of course , “ with an infinite deal of pleasure. ” I inserted a chisel , and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer , the top of the box flew suddenly off , and at the same instant , there sprang up into a sitting position , directly facing the host , the bruised , bloody , and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself . It gazed for a few seconds , fixedly and sorrowfully , with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes , full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow ; uttered slowly , but clearly and impressively , the words— “ Thou art the man ! ” and then , falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied , stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table . The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description . The rush for the doors and windows was terrific , and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror . But after the first wild , shrieking burst of affright , all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow . If I live a thousand years , I can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his , so lately rubicund with triumph and wine . For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble ; his eyes seeming , in the intense vacancy of their gaze , to be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable , murderous soul . At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world , when , with a quick leap , he sprang from his chair , and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table , and in contact with the corpse , poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die . What he recounted was in substance this : —He followed his victim to the vicinity of the pool ; there shot his horse with a pistol ; despatched its rider with the butt end ; possessed himself of the pocket-book ; and , supposing the horse dead , dragged it with great labour to the brambles by the pond . Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy , and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through the woods . The waistcoat , the knife , the pocket-book , and bullet , had been placed by himself where found , with the view of avenging himself upon Mr. Pennifeather . He had also contrived the discovery of the stained handkerchief and shirt . Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty wretch faltered and grew hollow . When the record was finally exhausted , he arose , staggered backward from the table , and fell—_dead_ . The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted , although efficient , were simple indeed . Mr. Goodfellow ’ s excess of frankness had disgusted me , and excited my suspicions from the first . I was present when Mr. Pennifeather had struck him , and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance , although momentary , assured me that his threat of vengeance would , if possible , be rigidly fulfilled . I was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of “ Old Charley ” in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough . I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose , either directly or indirectly , from himself . But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case , was the affair of the bullet , found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse . I had not forgotten , although the Rattleburghers had , that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse , and another where it went out . If it were found in the animal then , after having made its exit , I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it . The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet ; for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret , and no more . When I came to think of these things , and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow , I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether to myself . In the meantime , I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy , and , for good reasons , searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his party . The result was that , after some days , I came across an old dry well , the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles ; and here , at the bottom , I discovered what I sought . Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies , when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux . Upon this hint I acted . I procured a stiff piece of whalebone , thrust it down the throat of the corpse , and deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it . In this manner I had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails ; and I anticipated , of course , that as soon as these latter were removed , the top would fly off and the body up . Having thus arranged the box , I marked , numbered , and addressed it as already told ; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt , I gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow ’ s door , in a barrow , at a given signal from myself . For the words which I intended the corpse to speak , I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities ; for their effect , I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch . I believe there is nothing more to be explained . Mr. Pennifeather was released upon the spot , inherited the fortune of his uncle , profited by the lessons of experience , turned over a new leaf , and led happily ever afterward a new life . WHY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING It ’ s on my visiting cards sure enough ( and it ’ s them that ’ s all o ’ pink satin paper ) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin ’ words , “ Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , 39 Southampton Row , Russell Square , Parrish o ’ Bloomsbury. ” And shud ye be wantin ’ to diskiver who is the pink of purliteness quite , and the laider of the hot tun in the houl city o ’ Lonon—why it ’ s jist mesilf . And fait that same is no wonder at all at all ( so be plased to stop curlin ’ your nose ) , for every inch o ’ the six wakes that I ’ ve been a gintleman , and left aff wid the bog-throthing to take up wid the Barronissy , it ’ s Pathrick that ’ s been living like a houly imperor , and gitting the iddication and the graces . Och ! and wouldn ’ t it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye cud lay your two peepers jist , upon Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , when he is all riddy drissed for the hopperer , or stipping into the Brisky for the drive into the Hyde Park . But it ’ s the illigant big figgur that I ’ ave , for the rason o ’ which all the ladies fall in love wid me . Isn ’ t it my own swate silf now that ’ ll missure the six fut , and the three inches more nor that , in me stockins , and that am excadingly will proportioned all over to match ? And it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit that there is , inny how , of the little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way , and that ’ s a-oggling and a-goggling the houl day , ( and bad luck to him , ) at the purty widdy Misthress Tracle that ’ s my own nixt-door neighbor , ( God bliss her ! ) and a most particuller frind and acquaintance ? You percave the little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth , and wears his lift hand in a sling , and it ’ s for that same thing , by yur lave , that I ’ m going to give you the good rason . The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough ; for the very first day that I com ’ d from Connaught , and showd my swate little silf in the strait to the widdy , who was looking through the windy , it was a gone case althegither with the heart o ’ the purty Misthress Tracle . I percaved it , ye see , all at once , and no mistake , and that ’ s God ’ s truth . First of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy , and thin she threw open her two peepers to the itmost , and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she clapped tight to one o ’ them and divil may burn me if it didn ’ t spake to me as plain as a peeper cud spake , and says it , through the spy-glass : “ Och ! the tip o ’ the mornin ’ to ye , Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , mavourneen ; and it ’ s a nate gintleman that ye are , sure enough , and it ’ s mesilf and me forten jist that ’ ll be at yur sarvice , dear , inny time o ’ day at all at all for the asking. ” And it ’ s not mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the purliteness ; so I made her a bow that wud ha ’ broken yur heart altegither to behould , and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish , and thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes , as much as to say , “ True for you , yer a swate little crature , Mrs. Tracle , me darlint , and I wish I may be drownthed dead in a bog , if it ’ s not mesilf , Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , that ’ ll make a houl bushel o ’ love to yur leddyship , in the twinkling o ’ the eye of a Londonderry purraty. ” And it was the nixt mornin ’ , sure , jist as I was making up me mind whither it wouldn ’ t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o ’ writin ’ to the widdy by way of a love-litter , when up com ’ d the delivery servant wid an illigant card , and he tould me that the name on it ( for I niver could rade the copperplate printin ’ on account of being lift handed ) was all about Mounseer , the Count , A Goose , Look-aisy , Maiter-di-dauns , and that the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way . And jist wid that in cum ’ d the little willian himself , and then he made me a broth of a bow , and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing me the honor of the giving me a call , and thin he went on to palaver at a great rate , and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the tilling me at all at all , excipting and saving that he said “ pully wou , woolly wou , ” and tould me , among a bushel o ’ lies , bad luck to him , that he was mad for the love o ’ my widdy Misthress Tracle , and that my widdy Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him . At the hearin ’ of this , ye may swear , though , I was as mad as a grasshopper , but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , and that it wasn ’ t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the upper hand o ’ the purliteness , so I made light o ’ the matter and kipt dark , and got quite sociable wid the little chap , and afther a while what did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy ’ s , saying he wud give me the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship . “ Is it there ye are ? ” said I thin to mesilf , “ and it ’ s thrue for you , Pathrick , that ye ’ re the fortunittest mortal in life . We ’ ll soon see now whither it ’ s your swate silf , or whither it ’ s little Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns , that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid. ” Wid that we wint aff to the widdy ’ s , next door , and ye may well say it was an illigant place ; so it was . There was a carpet all over the floor , and in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew ’ s harp and the divil knows what ilse , and in another corner was a sofy , the beautifullest thing in all natur , and sitting on the sofy , sure enough , there was the swate little angel , Misthress Tracle . “ The tip o ’ the mornin ’ to ye , ” says I , “ Mrs . Tracle , ” and thin I made sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the brain o ’ ye . “ Wully woo , pully woo , plump in the mud , ” says the little furrenner Frinchman , “ and sure Mrs. Tracle , ” says he , that he did , “ isn ’ t this gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , and isn ’ t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and acquaintance that I have in the houl world ? ” And wid that the widdy , she gits up from the sofy , and makes the swatest curthchy nor iver was seen ; and thin down she sits like an angel ; and thin , by the powers , it was that little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns that plumped his silf right down by the right side of her . Och hon ! I ixpicted the two eyes o ’ me wud ha cum ’ d out of my head on the spot , I was so dispirate mad ! Howiver , “ Bait who ! ” says I , after awhile . “ Is it there ye are , Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns ? ” and so down I plumped on the lift side of her leddyship , to be aven with the willain . Botheration ! it wud ha done your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived her jist thin right in the face with both eyes . But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at all , and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship . “ Woully wou , ” says he , “ Pully wou , ” says he , “ Plump in the mud , ” says he . “ That ’ s all to no use , Mounseer Frog , mavourneen , ” thinks I ; and I talked as hard and as fast as I could all the while , and throth it was mesilf jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely , by rason of the illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of Connaught . And by and by she gived me such a swate smile , from one ind of her mouth to the ither , that it made me as bould as a pig , and I jist took hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in natur , looking at her all the while out o ’ the whites of my eyes . And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel , for no sooner did she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper , than she up wid it in a jiffy , and put it away behind her back , jist as much as to say , “ Now thin , Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , there ’ s a bitther chance for ye , mavourneen , for it ’ s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner Frinchman , Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. ” Wid that I giv ’ d her a big wink jist to say , “ lit Sir Pathrick alone for the likes o ’ them thricks , ” and thin I wint aisy to work , and you ’ d have died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm betwane the back o ’ the sofy , and the back of her leddyship , and there , sure enough , I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say , “ the tip o ’ the mornin ’ to ye , Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt. ” And wasn ’ t it mesilf , sure , that jist giv ’ d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the world , all in the way of a commincement , and not to be too rough wid her leddyship ? and och , botheration , wasn ’ t it the gentaalest and dilikittest of all the little squazes that I got in return ? “ Blood and thunder , Sir Pathrick , mavourneen , ” thinks I to mesilf , “ fait it ’ s jist the mother ’ s son of you , and nobody else at all at all , that ’ s the handsomest and the fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum ’ d out of Connaught ! ” And with that I givd the flipper a big squaze , and a big squaze it was , by the powers , that her leddyship giv ’ d to me back . But it would ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin ’ to behould , jist then all at once , the consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns . The likes o ’ sich a jabbering , and a smirking , and a parley-wouing as he begin ’ d wid her leddyship , niver was known before upon arth ; and divil may burn me if it wasn ’ t me own very two peepers that cotch ’ d him tipping her the wink out of one eye . Och , hon ! if it wasn ’ t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be tould who it was ! “ Let me infarm you , Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns , ” said I , as purlite as iver ye seed , “ that it ’ s not the gintaal thing at all at all , and not for the likes o ’ you inny how , to be afther the oggling and a-goggling at her leddyship in that fashion , ” and jist wid that such another squaze as it was I giv ’ d her flipper , all as much as to say , “ isn ’ t it Sir Pathrick now , my jewel , that ’ ll be able to the protectin ’ o ’ you , my darlint ? ” and then there cum ’ d another squaze back , all by way of the answer . “ Thrue for you , Sir Pathrick , ” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world , “ Thrue for you , Sir Pathrick , mavourneen , and it ’ s a proper nate gintleman ye are—that ’ s God ’ s truth , ” and with that she opened her two beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha ’ cum ’ d out of her hid althegither and intirely , and she looked first as mad as a cat at Mounseer Frog , and thin as smiling as all out o ’ doors at mesilf . “ Thin , ” says he , the willian , “ Och hon ! and a wolly-wou , pully-wou , ” and then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his hid was to be diskivered , and then he let down the two corners of his purraty-trap , and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git out o ’ the spalpeen . Belave me , my jewel , it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin , and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the widdy ; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper , as much as to say , “ At him again , Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , mavourneen : ” so I just ripped out wid a big oath , and says I : “ Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun ! ” —and jist thin what d ’ ye think it was that her leddyship did ? Troth she jumped up from the sofy as if she was bit , and made off through the door , while I turned my head round afther her , in a complate bewilderment and botheration , and followed her wid me two peepers . You percave I had a reason of my own for knowing that she couldn ’ t git down the stares althegither and intirely ; for I knew very well that I had hould of her hand , for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go . And says I : “ Isn ’ t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that ye ’ ve been afther the making , yer leddyship ? Come back now , that ’ s a darlint , and I ’ ll give ye yur flipper. ” But aff she wint down the stairs like a shot , and thin I turned round to the little Frinch furrenner . Och hon ! if it wasn ’ t his spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own—why thin—thin it wasn ’ t—that ’ s all . And maybe it wasn ’ t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin ’ , to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn ’ t the widdy at all at all that he had had hould of all the time , but only Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison . The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he pet an ! As for Sir Pathrick O ’ Grandison , Barronitt , it wasn ’ t for the likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake . Ye may jist say , though ( for it ’ s God ’ s thruth ) , that afore I left hould of the flipper of the spalpeen ( which was not till afther her leddyship ’ s futman had kicked us both down the stairs ) , I giv ’ d it such a nate little broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam . “ Woully wou , ” says he , “ pully wou , ” says he— “ Cot tam ! ” And that ’ s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a sling . BON-BON . Quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac , Je suis plus savant que Balzac— Plus sage que Pibrac ; Mon bras seul faisant l ’ attaque De la nation Cossaque , La mettroit au sac ; De Charon je passerois le lac , En dormant dans son bac ; J ’ irois au fier Eac , Sans que mon coeur fit tic ni tac , Présenter du tabac . —_French Vaudeville_ That Pierre Bon-Bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications , no man who , during the reign of—— , frequented the little Câfé in the cul-de-sac Le Febre at Rouen , will , I imagine , feel himself at liberty to dispute . That Pierre Bon-Bon was , in an equal degree , skilled in the philosophy of that period is , I presume , still more especially undeniable . His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate ; but what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_—his thoughts _sur l ’ Ame_—his observations _sur l ’ Esprit ? _ If his _omelettes_—if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable , what _littérateur_ of that day would not have given twice as much for an “ _Idée de Bon-Bon_ ” as for all the trash of “ _Idées_ ” of all the rest of the _savants ? _ Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no other man had ransacked—had more than any other would have entertained a notion of reading—had understood more than any other would have conceived the possibility of understanding ; and although , while he flourished , there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert “ that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the Academy , nor the depth of the Lyceum ” —although , mark me , his doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended , still it did not follow that they were difficult of comprehension . It was , I think , on account of their self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse . It is to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics . The former was indeed not a Platonist , nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian—nor did he , like the modern Leibnitz , waste those precious hours which might be employed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or , _facili gradú_ , the analysis of a sensation , in frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion . Not at all . Bon-Bon was Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic . He reasoned _à priori_—He reasoned also _à posteriori_ . His ideas were innate—or otherwise . He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in Bossarion [ Bessarion ] . Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist . I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_ . I would not , however , have any friend of mine imagine that , in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line , our hero wanted a proper estimation of their dignity and importance . Far from it . It was impossible to say in which branch of his profession he took the greater pride . In his opinion the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities of the stomach . I am not sure , indeed , that he greatly disagreed with the Chinese , who held that the soul lies in the abdomen . The Greeks at all events were right , he thought , who employed the same words for the mind and the diaphragm . ( * 1 ) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of gluttony , or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the metaphysician . If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man has not a thousand ? —if Pierre Bon-Bon , I say , had his failings , they were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which , in other tempers , have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues . As regards one of these foibles , I should not even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme _alto relievo_—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general disposition . He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain . { * 1 } MD Not that he was avaricious—no . It was by no means necessary to the satisfaction of the philosopher , that the bargain should be to his own proper advantage . Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any kind , upon any terms , or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance , and a knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity . At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the one I have just mentioned , should elicit attention and remark . At the epoch of our narrative , had this peculiarity not attracted observation , there would have been room for wonder indeed . It was soon reported that , upon all occasions of the kind , the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes , or welcome an acquaintance . Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature ; stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at leisure ; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities , vague longings , and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil for wise purposes of his own . The philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy our serious examination . For example , there are few men of extraordinary profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle . Whether this inclination be an exciting cause , or rather a valid proof of such profundity , it is a nice thing to say . Bon-Bon , as far as I can learn , did not think the subject adapted to minute investigation ; —nor do I . Yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical , it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to characterize , at one and the same time , his essais and his omelettes . In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had its allotted hour , and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du Rhone . With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer . He would sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray , but unravel an argument over Clos de Vougeot , and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin . Well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended",The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe5
