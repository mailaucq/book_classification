round and round the room Accordingly I started at once and she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of Mr Pumblechook s chaise cart She was not physically strong and after a little time said Slower Still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast After a while she said Call Estella so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion When her light appeared I returned to Miss Havisham and we started away again round and round the room If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings I should have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below I didn t know what to do In my politeness I would have stopped but Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted on with a shame faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing Dear Miss Havisham said Miss Sarah Pocket How well you look I do not returned Miss Havisham I am yellow skin and bone Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff and she murmured as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham Poor dear soul Certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing The idea And how are you said Miss Havisham to Camilla As we were close to Camilla then I would have stopped as a matter of course only Miss Havisham wouldn t stop We swept on and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla Thank you Miss Havisham she returned I am as well as can be expected Why what s the matter with you asked Miss Havisham with exceeding sharpness Nothing worth mentioning replied Camilla I don t wish to make a display of my feelings but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to Then don t think of me retorted Miss Havisham Very easily said remarked Camilla amiably repressing a sob while a hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs Chokings and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love If I could be less affectionate and sensitive I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves I am sure I wish it could be so But as to not thinking of you in the night The idea Here a burst of tears The Raymond referred to I understood to be the gentleman present and him I understood to be Mr Camilla He came to the rescue at this point and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice Camilla my dear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other I am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person my dear Miss Sarah Pocket whom I now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnut shells and a large mouth like a cat s without the whiskers supported this position by saying No indeed my dear Hem Thinking is easy enough said the grave lady What is easier you know assented Miss Sarah Pocket Oh yes yes cried Camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom It s all very true It s a weakness to be so affectionate but I can t help it No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise still I wouldn t change my disposition if I could It s the cause of much suffering but it s a consolation to know I posses it when I wake up in the night Here another burst of feeling Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time but kept going round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber There s Matthew said Camilla Never mixing with any natural ties never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head over the side and my hair all down and my feet I don t know where Much higher than your head my love said Mr Camilla I have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of Matthew s strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me Really I must say I should think not interposed the grave lady You see my dear added Miss Sarah Pocket a blandly vicious personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to thank you my love Without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed Camilla I have remained in that state hours and hours and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been and I have been heard at the piano forte tuner s across the street where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance and now to be told Here Camilla put her hand to her throat and began to

faces and they seemed to be puzzling as to what they had done in the past to deserve such a punishment Picture Firing from the trenches at Velestinos Other men were carried out of the trench and laid on their backs on the high grass staring up drunkenly at the glaring sun and with their limbs fallen into unfamiliar poses They lay so still and they were so utterly oblivious of the roar and rattle and the anxious energy around them that one grew rather afraid of them and of their superiority to their surroundings The sun beat on them and the insects in the grass waving above them buzzed and hummed or burrowed in the warm moist earth upon which they lay over their heads the invisible carriers of death jarred the air with shrill crescendoes and near them a comrade sat hacking with his bayonet at a lump of hard bread He sprawled contentedly in the hot sun with humped shoulders and legs far apart and with his cap tipped far over his eyes Every now and again he would pause with a piece of cheese balanced on the end of his knife blade and look at the twisted figures by him on the grass or he would dodge involuntarily as a shell swung low above his head and smile nervously at the still forms on either side of him that had not moved Then he brushed the crumbs from his jacket and took a drink out of his hot canteen and looking again at the sleeping figures pressing down the long grass beside him crawled back on his hands and knees to the trench and picked up his waiting rifle The dead gave dignity to what the other men were doing and made it noble and from another point of view quite senseless For their dying had proved nothing Men who could have been much better spared than they were still alive in the trenches and for no reason but through mere dumb chance There was no selection of the unfittest it seemed to be ruled by unreasoning luck A certain number of shells and bullets passed through a certain area of space and men of different bulks blocked that space in different places If a man happened to be standing in the line of a bullet he was killed and passed into eternity leaving a wife and children perhaps to mourn him Father died these children will say doing his duty As a matter of fact father died because he happened to stand up at the wrong moment or because he turned to ask the man on his right for a match instead of leaning toward the left and he projected his bulk of two hundred pounds where a bullet fired by a man who did not know him and who had not aimed at him happened to want the right of way One of the two had to give it and as the bullet would not the soldier had his heart torn out The man who sat next to me happened to stoop to fill his cartridge box just as the bullet that wanted the space he had occupied passed over his bent shoulder and so he was not killed but will live for sixty years perhaps and will do much good or much evil Another man in the same trench sat up to clean his rifle and had his arm in the air driving the cleaning rod down the barrel when a bullet passed through his lungs and the gun fell across his face with the rod sticking in it and he pitched forward on his shoulder quite dead If he had not cleaned his gun at that moment he would probably be alive in Athens now sitting in front of a cafe and fighting the war over again Viewed from that point and leaving out the fact that God ordered it all the fortunes of the game of war seemed as capricious as matching pennies and as impersonal as the wheel at Monte Carlo In it the brave man did not win because he was brave but because he was lucky A fool and a philosopher are equal at a game of dice And these men who threw dice with death were interesting to watch because though they gambled for so great a stake they did so unconcernedly and without flinching and without apparently appreciating the seriousness of the game There was a red headed freckled peasant boy in dirty petticoats who guided Bass and myself to the trenches He was one of the few peasants who had not run away and as he had driven sheep over every foot of the hills he was able to guide the soldiers through those places where they were best protected from the bullets of the enemy He did this all day and was always whether coming or going under a heavy fire but he enjoyed that fact and he seemed to regard the battle only as a delightful change in the quiet routine of his life as one of our own country boys at home would regard the coming of the spring circus or the burning of a neighbor s barn He ran dancing ahead of us pointing to where a ledge of rock offered a natural shelter or showing us a steep gully where the bullets could not fall When they came very near him he would jump high in the air not because he was startled but out of pure animal joy in the excitement of it and he would frown importantly and shake his red curls at us as though to say I told you to be careful Now you see Don t let that happen again We met him many times during the two days escorting different companies of soldiers from one point to another as though they were visitors to his estate When a shell broke he would pick up,richardHarding
in that expanse of barrenness The sunlight inundated the upper two blinds of our sphere and turned our climate to high summer but our feet were still in shadow and the sphere was lying upon a drift of snow And scattered here and there upon the slope and emphasised by little white threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides were shapes like sticks dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which they lay That caught one s thoughts sharply Sticks On a lifeless world Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their substance I perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous texture like the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade of pine trees Cavor I said Yes It may be a dead world now but once Something arrested my attention I had discovered among these needles a number of little round objects And it seemed to me that one of these had moved Cavor I whispered What But I did not answer at once I stared incredulous For an instant I could not believe my eyes I gave an inarticulate cry I gripped his arm I pointed Look I cried finding my tongue There Yes And there His eyes followed my pointing finger Eh he said How can I describe the thing I saw It is so petty a thing to state and yet it seemed so wonderful so pregnant with emotion I have said that amidst the stick like litter were these rounded bodies these little oval bodies that might have passed as very small pebbles And now first one and then another had stirred had rolled over and cracked and down the crack of each of them showed a minute line of yellowish green thrusting outward to meet the hot encouragement of the newly risen sun For a moment that was all and then there stirred and burst a third It is a seed said Cavor And then I heard him whisper very softly Life Life And immediately it poured upon us that our vast journey had not been made in vain that we had come to no arid waste of minerals but to a world that lived and moved We watched intensely I remember I kept rubbing the glass before me with my sleeve jealous of the faintest suspicion of mist The picture was clear and vivid only in the middle of the field All about that centre the dead fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by the curvature of the glass But we could see enough One after another all down the sunlit slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and gaped apart like seed pods like the husks of fruits opened eager mouths that drank in the heat and light pouring in a cascade from the newly risen sun Every moment more of these seed coats ruptured and even as they did so the swelling pioneers overflowed their rent distended seed cases and passed into the second stage of growth With a steady assurance a swift deliberation these amazing seeds thrust a rootlet downward to the earth and a queer little bundle like bud into the air In a little while the whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets standing at attention in the blaze of the sun They did not stand for long The bundle like buds swelled and strained and opened with a jerk thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips spreading a whorl of tiny spiky brownish leaves that lengthened rapidly lengthened visibly even as we watched The movement was slower than any animal s swifter than any plant s I have ever seen before How can I suggest it to you the way that growth went on The leaf tips grew so that they moved onward even while we looked at them The brown seed case shrivelled and was absorbed with an equal rapidity Have you ever on a cold day taken a thermometer into your warm hand and watched the little thread of mercury creep up the tube These moon plants grew like that In a few minutes as it seemed the buds of the more forward of these plants had lengthened into a stem and were even putting forth a second whorl of leaves and all the slope that had seemed so recently a lifeless stretch of litter was now dark with the stunted olive green herbage of bristling spikes that swayed with the vigour of their growing I turned about and behold along the upper edge of a rock to the eastward a similar fringe in a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent dark against the blinding glare of the sun And beyond this fringe was the silhouette of a plant mass branching clumsily like a cactus and swelling visibly swelling like a bladder that fills with air Then to the westward also I discovered that another such distended form was rising over the scrub But here the light fell upon its sleek sides and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange hue It rose as one watched it if one looked away from it for a minute and then back its outline had changed it thrust out blunt congested branches until in a little time it rose a coralline shape of many feet in height Compared with such a growth the terrestrial puff ball which will sometimes swell a foot in diameter in a single night would be a hopeless laggard But then the puff ball grows against a gravitational pull six times that of the moon Beyond out of gullies and flats that had been hidden from us but not from the quickening sun over reefs and banks of shining rock a bristling beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining into view hurrying tumultuously to take advantage of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit and seed again and die It,hgWells
out one under bogey and it was only the fear that having known him for so short a time she might be startled and refuse him that kept him from proposing then and there This exhibition of golfing generalship on her part had removed his last doubts He knew that if he lived for ever there could be no other girl in the world for him With her at his side what might he not do He might get his handicap down to six to three to scratch to plus something Good heavens why even the Amateur Championship was not outside the range of possibility Mortimer Sturgis shook his putter solemnly in the air and vowed a silent vow that he would win this pearl among women Now when a man feels like that it is impossible to restrain him long For a week Mortimer Sturgis s soul sizzled within him then he could contain himself no longer One night at one of the informal dances at the hotel he drew the girl out on to the moonlit terrace Miss Somerset he began stuttering with emotion like an imperfectly corked bottle of ginger beer Miss Somerset may I call you Mary The girl looked at him with eyes that shone softly in the dim light Mary she repeated Why of course if you like If I like cried Mortimer Don t you know that it is my dearest wish Don t you know that I would rather be permitted to call you Mary than do the first hole at Muirfield in two Oh Mary how I have longed for this moment I love you I love you Ever since I met you I have known that you were the one girl in this vast world whom I would die to win Mary will you be mine Shall we go round together Will you fix up a match with me on the links of life which shall end only when the Grim Reaper lays us both a stymie She drooped towards him Mortimer she murmured He held out his arms then drew back His face had grown suddenly tense and there were lines of pain about his mouth Wait he said in a strained voice Mary I love you dearly and because I love you so dearly I can not let you trust your sweet life to me blindly I have a confession to make I am not I have not always been he paused a good man he said in a low voice She started indignantly How can you say that You are the best the kindest the bravest man I have ever met Who but a good man would have risked his life to save me from drowning Drowning Mortimer s voice seemed perplexed You What do you mean Have you forgotten the time when I fell in the sea last week and you jumped in with all your clothes on Of course yes said Mortimer I remember now It was the day I did the long seventh in five I got off a good tee shot straight down the fairway took a baffy for my second and But that is not the point It is sweet and generous of you to think so highly of what was the merest commonplace act of ordinary politeness but I must repeat that judged by the standards of your snowy purity I am not a good man I do not come to you clean and spotless as a young girl should expect her husband to come to her Once playing in a foursome my ball fell in some long grass Nobody was near me We had no caddies and the others were on the fairway God knows His voice shook God knows I struggled against the temptation But I fell I kicked the ball on to a little bare mound from which it was an easy task with a nice half mashie to reach the green for a snappy seven Mary there have been times when going round by myself I have allowed myself ten foot putts on three holes in succession simply in order to be able to say I had done the course in under a hundred Ah you shrink from me You are disgusted I m not disgusted And I don t shrink I only shivered because it is rather cold Then you can love me in spite of my past Mortimer She fell into his arms My dearest he said presently what a happy life ours will be That is if you do not find that you have made a mistake A mistake she cried scornfully Well my handicap is twelve you know and not so darned twelve at that There are days when I play my second from the fairway of the next hole but one days when I couldn t putt into a coal hole with Welcome written over it And you are a Ladies Open Champion Still if you think it s all right Oh Mary you little know how I have dreamed of some day marrying a really first class golfer Yes that was my vision of walking up the aisle with some sweet plus two girl on my arm You shivered again You are catching cold It is a little cold said the girl She spoke in a small voice Let me take you in sweetheart said Mortimer I ll just put you in a comfortable chair with a nice cup of coffee and then I think I really must come out again and tramp about and think how perfectly splendid everything is They were married a few weeks later very quietly in the little village church of Saint Brule The secretary of the local golf club acted as best man for Mortimer and a girl from the hotel was the only bridesmaid The whole business was rather a disappointment to Mortimer who had planned out a somewhat florid ceremony at St George,pgWodehouse
latter girlhood of some years in London and a womanhood here had taken all rawness out of her When she was gone he continued his work reflecting on her He had been so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her general mould and build He remembered now that she was not a large figure that she was light and slight of the type dubbed elegant That was about all he had seen There was nothing statuesque in her all was nervous motion She was mobile living yet a painter might not have called her handsome or beautiful But the much that she was surprised him She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity that was his How could one of his cross grained unfortunate almost accursed stock have contrived to reach this pitch of niceness London had done it he supposed From this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his breast as the bottled up effect of solitude and the poetized locality he dwelt in insensibly began to precipitate itself on this half visionary form and he perceived that whatever his obedient wish in a contrary direction he would soon be unable to resist the desire to make himself known to her He affected to think of her quite in a family way since there were crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any other The first reason was that he was married and it would be wrong The second was that they were cousins It was not well for cousins to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion The third even were he free in a family like his own where marriage usually meant a tragic sadness marriage with a blood relation would duplicate the adverse conditions and a tragic sadness might be intensified to a tragic horror Therefore again he would have to think of Sue with only a relation s mutual interest in one belonging to him regard her in a practical way as some one to be proud of to talk and nod to later on to be invited to tea by the emotion spent on her being rigorously that of a kinsman and well wisher So would she be to him a kindly star an elevating power a companion in Anglican worship a tender friend III But under the various deterrent influences Jude s instinct was to approach her timidly and the next Sunday he went to the morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her for he had found that she frequently attended there She did not come and he awaited her in the afternoon which was finer He knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible and he stood in a corner while the bell was going A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite and followed her into the building more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself To see her and to be himself unseen and unknown was enough for him at present He lingered awhile in the vestibule and the service was some way advanced when he was put into a seat It was a louring mournful still afternoon when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary practical men and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured classes In the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only but he saw that Sue was among them He had not long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second part In quo corriget the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian tune as the singers gave forth Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way It was the very question that was engaging Jude s attention at this moment What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he had done to an animal passion for a woman and allow it to lead to such disastrous consequences then to think of putting an end to himself then to go recklessly and get drunk The great waves of pedal music tumbled round the choir and nursed on the supernatural as he had been it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this moment of his first entry into the solemn building And yet it was the ordinary psalm for the twenty fourth evening of the month The girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears and the thought was a delight to him She was probably a frequenter of this place and steeped body and soul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit had no doubt much in common with him To an impressionable and lonely young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts which promised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities was like the dew of Hermon and he remained throughout the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy Though he was loth to suspect it some people might have said to him that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee Jude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen before he himself moved She did not look towards him and by the time he reached the door she was half way down the broad path

world In travelling by land there is a continuity of scene and a connected succession of persons and incidents that carry on the story of life and lessen the effect of absence and separation We drag it is true a lengthening chain at each remove of our pilgrimage but the chain is unbroken we can trace it back link by link and we feel that the last still grapples us to home But a wide sea voyage severs us at once It makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of settled life and sent adrift upon a doubtful world It interposes a gulf not merely imaginary but real between us and our homes a gulf subject to tempest and fear and uncertainty rendering distance palpable and return precarious Such at least was the case with myself As I saw the last blue lines of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon it seemed as if I had closed one volume of the world and its concerns and had time for meditation before I opened another That land too now vanishing from my view which contained all most dear to me in life what vicissitudes might occur in it what changes might take place in me before I should visit it again Who can tell when he sets forth to wander whither he may be driven by the uncertain currents of existence or when he may return or whether it may be ever his lot to revisit the scenes of his childhood I said that at sea all is vacancy I should correct the impression To one given to day dreaming and fond of losing himself in reveries a sea voyage is full of subjects for meditation but then they are the wonders of the deep and of the air and rather tend to abstract the mind from worldly themes I delighted to loll over the quarter railing or climb to the main top of a calm day and muse for hours together on the tranquil bosom of a summer s sea to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon fancy them some fairy realms and people them with a creation of my own to watch the gently undulating billows rolling their silver volumes as if to die away on those happy shores There was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe with which I looked down from my giddy height on the monsters of the deep at their uncouth gambols shoals of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the ship the grampus slowly heaving his huge form above the surface or the ravenous shark darting like a spectre through the blue waters My imagination would conjure up all that I had heard or read of the watery world beneath me of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys of the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the earth and of those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and sailors Sometimes a distant sail gliding along the edge of the ocean would be another theme of idle speculation How interesting this fragment of a world hastening to rejoin the great mass of existence What a glorious monument of human invention which has in a manner triumphed over wind and wave has brought the ends of the world into communion has established an interchange of blessings pouring into the sterile regions of the north all the luxuries of the south has diffused the light of knowledge and the charities of cultivated life and has thus bound together those scattered portions of the human race between which nature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier We one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance At sea every thing that breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse attracts attention It proved to be the mast of a ship that must have been completely wrecked for there were the remains of handkerchiefs by which some of the crew had fastened themselves to this spar to prevent their being washed off by the waves There was no trace by which the name of the ship could be ascertained The wreck had evidently drifted about for many months clusters of shell fish had fastened about it and long sea weeds flaunted at its sides But where thought I is the crew Their struggle has long been over they have gone down amidst the roar of the tempest their bones lie whitening among the caverns of the deep Silence oblivion like the waves have closed over them and no one can tell the story of their end What sighs have been wafted after that ship what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home How often has the mistress the wife the mother pored over the daily news to catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep How has expectation darkened into anxiety anxiety into dread and dread into despair Alas not one memento may ever return for love to cherish All that may ever be known is that she sailed from her port and was never heard of more The sight of this wreck as usual gave rise to many dismal anecdotes This was particularly the case in the evening when the weather which had hitherto been fair began to look wild and threatening and gave indications of one of those sudden storms that will sometimes break in upon the serenity of a summer voyage As we sat round the dull light of a lamp in the cabin that made the gloom more ghastly everyone had his tale of shipwreck and disaster I was particularly struck with a short one related by the captain As I was once sailing said he in a fine stout ship across the banks of Newfoundland one of those heavy fogs that prevail in those parts rendered it impossible for us to see far ahead even in,whashingtonIrving
verses telling her that another shared her distresses whatever they might be and loved her with all his heart and that he would never rest until he had delivered her from the hands of the man she hated Thus encouraged she told him all her story and of the arrival of a young stranger in her father s palace whose looks had so charmed her that since that day she had thought of no one else At these words the Prince could contain himself no longer He took the pebble from his mouth and flung himself at Rosalie s feet When they had got over the first rapture of meeting they began to make plans to escape from the power of the Prince of the Air But this did not prove easy for the magic stone would only serve for one person at a time and in order to save Rosalie the Prince of the Golden Isle would have to expose himself to the fury of his enemy But Rosalie would not hear of this No Prince she said since you are here this island no longer feels a prison Besides you are under the protection of a Fairy who always visits your father s court at this season Go instantly and seek her and when she is found implore the gift of another stone with similar powers Once you have that there will be no further difficulty in the way of escape The Prince of the Air returned a few days later from his mother s palace but the Invisible Prince had already set out He had however entirely forgotten the road by which he had come and lost himself for so long in the forest that when at last he reached home the Fairy had already left and in spite of all his grief there was nothing for it but to wait till the Fairy s next visit and allow Rosalie to suffer three months longer This thought drove him to despair and he had almost made up his mind to return to the place of her captivity when one day as he was strolling along an alley in the woods he saw a huge oak open its trunk and out of it step two Princes in earnest conversation As our hero had the magic stone in his mouth they imagined themselves alone and did not lower their voices What said one are you always going to allow yourself to be tormented by a passion which can never end happily and in your whole kingdom can you find nothing else to satisfy you What is the use replied the other of being Prince of the Gnomes and having a mother who is queen over all the four elements if I can not win the love of the Princess Argentine From the moment that I first saw her sitting in the forest surrounded by flowers I have never ceased to think of her night and day and although I love her I am quite convinced that she will never care for me You know that I have in my palace the cabinets of the years In the first great mirrors reflect the past in the second we contemplate the present in the third the future can be read It was here that I fled after I had gazed on the Princess Argentine but instead of love I only saw scorn and contempt Think how great must be my devotion when in spite of my fate I still love on Now the Prince of the Golden Isle was enchanted with this conversation for the Princess Argentine was his sister and he hoped by means of her influence over the Prince of the Gnomes to obtain from his brother the release of Rosalie So he joyfully returned to his father s palace where he found his friend the Fairy who at once presented him with a magic pebble like his own As may be imagined he lost no time in setting out to deliver Rosalie and travelled so fast that he soon arrived at the forest in the midst of which she lay a captive But though he found the palace he did not find Rosalie He hunted high and low but there was no sign of her and his despair was so great that he was ready a thousand times over to take his own life At last he remembered the conversation of the two Princes about the cabinets of the years and that if he could manage to reach the oak tree he would be certain to discover what had become of Rosalie Happily he soon found out the secret of the passage and entered the cabinet of the present where he saw reflected in the mirrors the unfortunate Rosalie sitting on the floor weeping bitterly and surrounded with genii who never left her night or day This sight only increased the misery of the Prince for he did not know where the castle was nor how to set about finding it However he resolved to seek the whole world through till he came to the right place He began by setting sail in a favourable wind but his bad luck followed him even on the sea He had scarcely lost sight of the land when a violent storm arose and after several hours of beating about the vessel was driven on to some rocks on which it dashed itself to bits The Prince was fortunate enough to be able to lay hold of a floating spar and contrived to keep himself afloat and after a long struggle with the winds and waves he was cast upon a strange island But what was his surprise on reaching the shore to hear sounds of the most heartrending distress mingled with the sweetest songs which had ever charmed him His curiosity was instantly roused and he advanced cautiously till he saw two huge dragons guarding the gate of a wood They,andrewLang
moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the Collector s junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with I think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice He was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other My conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as I have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what I found in him It might be difficult and it was so to conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age One point in which he had vastly the advantage over his four footed brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster As he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butcher s meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table His reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one s very nostrils There were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast I have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him not in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual A tender loin of beef a hind quarter of veal a spare rib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder Adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze The chief tragic event of the old man s life so far as I could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carving knife would make no impression on its carcass and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw But it is time to quit this sketch on which however I should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom I have ever known this individual was fittest to be a Custom House officer Most persons owing to causes which I may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life The old Inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite There is one likeness without which my gallery of Custom House portraits would be strangely incomplete but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline It is that of the Collector our gallant old General who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild Western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honorable life The brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his threescore years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit stirring recollections could do little towards lightening The step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge It was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the Custom House steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace There he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation His countenance in this repose was mild and kindly If his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage The closer you

line Is it by chance for flirting I don t think so You may suspect that at first but you ll be wrong You won t I think in any way be easily right about her Warburton s wrong then Ralph rejoicingly exclaimed He flatters himself he has made that discovery His mother shook her head Lord Warburton won t understand her He needn t try He s very intelligent said Ralph but it s right he should be puzzled once in a while Isabel will enjoy puzzling a lord Mrs Touchett remarked Her son frowned a little What does she know about lords Nothing at all that will puzzle him all the more Ralph greeted these words with a laugh and looked out of the window Then Are you not going down to see my father he asked At a quarter to eight said Mrs Touchett Her son looked at his watch You ve another quarter of an hour then Tell me some more about Isabel After which as Mrs Touchett declined his invitation declaring that he must find out for himself Well he pursued she ll certainly do you credit But won t she also give you trouble I hope not but if she does I shall not shrink from it I never do that She strikes me as very natural said Ralph Natural people are not the most trouble No said Ralph you yourself are a proof of that You re extremely natural and I m sure you have never troubled any one It takes trouble to do that But tell me this it just occurs to me Is Isabel capable of making herself disagreeable Ah cried his mother you ask too many questions Find that out for yourself His questions however were not exhausted All this time he said you ve not told me what you intend to do with her Do with her You talk as if she were a yard of calico I shall do absolutely nothing with her and she herself will do everything she chooses She gave me notice of that What you meant then in your telegram was that her character s independent I never know what I mean in my telegrams especially those I send from America Clearness is too expensive Come down to your father It s not yet a quarter to eight said Ralph I must allow for his impatience Mrs Touchett answered Ralph knew what to think of his father s impatience but making no rejoinder he offered his mother his arm This put it in his power as they descended together to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the staircase the broad low wide armed staircase of time blackened oak which was one of the most striking features of Gardencourt You ve no plan of marrying her he smiled Marrying her I should be sorry to play her such a trick But apart from that she s perfectly able to marry herself She has every facility Do you mean to say she has a husband picked out I don t know about a husband but there s a young man in Boston Ralph went on he had no desire to hear about the young man in Boston As my father says they re always engaged His mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the source and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion He had a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been left together in the drawing room Lord Warburton who had ridden over from his own house some ten miles distant remounted and took his departure before dinner and an hour after this meal was ended Mr and Mrs Touchett who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their forms withdrew under the valid pretext of fatigue to their respective apartments The young man spent an hour with his cousin though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent She was really tired she knew it and knew she should pay for it on the morrow but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down A fine hypocrisy was for the present possible she was interested she was as she said to herself floated She asked Ralph to show her the pictures there were a great many in the house most of them of his own choosing The best were arranged in an oaken gallery of charming proportions which had a sitting room at either end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted The light was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage and the visit might have stood over to the morrow This suggestion Ralph had ventured to make but Isabel looked disappointed smiling still however and said If you please I should like to see them just a little She was eager she knew she was eager and now seemed so she couldn t help it She doesn t take suggestions Ralph said to himself but he said it without irritation her pressure amused and even pleased him The lamps were on brackets at intervals and if the light was imperfect it was genial It fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames it made a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery Ralph took a candlestick and moved about pointing out the things he liked Isabel inclining to one picture after another indulged in little exclamations and murmurs She was evidently a judge she had a natural taste he was struck with that She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there she lifted it high and as she did so he found himself pausing in the middle of the place and bending his eyes

red plush chair Her face was perfectly colorless her manner frozen The word seemed to speak itself without having any relation whatever to her thoughts and her emotions Kent waited It seemed to him that she took it harder than she would have taken the news that Manley was dead He had no means of gauging the horror of a young woman who has all her life been familiar with such terms as the demon rum and who has been taught that intemperance is the doorway to perdition a young woman whose life has been sheltered jealously from all contact with the ugly things of the world and who believes that she might better die than marry a drunkard He watched her unobtrusively Anyway it was worrying over you that made him get off wrong to day he ventured at last as a sort of palliative They say he was going to start home right in the face of the fire and when they wouldn t let him he headed straight for a saloon and commenced to pour whisky down him He thought sure you he thought the fire would I see Val interrupted stonily For the very doubtful honor of shaking the hand of a politician he left me alone to face as best I might the possibility of burning alive and when it seemed likely that the possibility had become a certainty he must celebrate his bereavement by becoming a beast Is that what you would have me believe of my husband That s about the size of it Kent admitted reluctantly Only I wouldn t have put it just that way maybe Indeed And how would you pit it then Kent leaned harder against the door and looked at her curiously Women it seemed to him were always going to extremes they were either too soft and meek or else they were too hard and unmerciful How would you put it I am rather curious to know your point of view Well I know men better than you do Mrs Fleetwood I know they can do some things that look pretty rotten on the surface and yet be fairly decent underneath You don t know how a habit like that gets a fellow just where he s weakest Man ain t a beast He s selfish and careless and he gives way too easy but he thinks the world of you Jim says he cried like a baby when he came into the saloon and acted like a crazy man You don t want to be too hard on him I ve an idea this will learn him a lesson If you take him the right way Mrs Fleetwood the chances are he ll quit drinking Val smiled Kent thought he had never before seen a smile like that and hoped he never would see another There was in it neither mercy nor mirth but only the hard judgment of a woman who does not understand Will you bring him to me here Mr Burnett I do not feel quite equal to invading a saloon and begging him on my knees to come after the conventional manner of drunkards wives But I should like to see him Kent stared He ain t in any shape to argue with he remonstrated You better wait a while She rested her chin upon her hands folded upon the high chair back and gazed at him with her tawny eyes that somehow reminded Kent of a lioness in a cage He thought swiftly that a lioness would have as much mercy as she had in that mood Mr Burnett she began quietly when Kent s nerves were beginning to feel the strain of her silent stare I want to see Manley as he is now I will tell you why You aren t a woman and you never will understand but I shall tell you I want to tell somebody I was raised well that sounds queer but modesty forbids more At any rate my mother was very careful about me She believed in a girl marrying and becoming a good wife to a good man and to that end she taught me and trained me A woman must give her all her life her past present and future to the man she marries For three years I thought how unworthy I was to be Manley s wife Unworthy do you hear I slept with his letters under my pillow The self contempt in her tone I studied the things I thought would make me a better companion out here in the wilderness I practiced hours and hours every day upon my violin because Manley had admired my playing and I thought it would please him to have me play in the firelight on winter evenings when the blizzards were howling about the house I learned to cook to wash clothes to iron to sweep and to scrub and to make my own clothes because Manley s wife would live where she could not hire servants to do these things I lived a beautiful picturesque dream of domestic happiness I left my friends my home all the things I had been accustomed to all my life and I came out here to live that dream She laughed bitterly You can easily guess how much of it has come true Mr Burnett But you don t know what it costs a girl to come down from the clouds and find that reality is hard and ugly from dreaming of a cozy little nest of a home and the love and care of of Manley to the reality to carrying water and chopping wood and being left alone day after day and to find that his love only meant Oh you don t know how a woman clings to her ideals You don t know how I have dung to mine They have become rather tattered and I have had to mend them,bmBower
another aspect he was an opportune victim something to strike at When the anger of a poison snake opens its gland and the fang is charged with venom it must strike at something It does not pause or consider what it may be it strikes though it may be at stone or iron So Stephen waited till her victim was within distance to strike Her black eyes fierce with passion and blood rimmed as a cobra s glittered as he passed among the tree trunks towards her eager with his errand of devotion Harold was a man of strong purpose Had he not been he would never have come on his present errand Never perhaps had any suitor set forth on his quest with a heavier heart All his life since his very boyhood had been centred round the girl whom to day he had come to serve All his thought had been for her and to day all he could expect was a gentle denial of all his hopes so that his future life would be at best a blank But he would be serving Stephen His pain might be to her good ought to be to a certain extent to her mental ease Her wounded pride would find some solace As he came closer the feeling that he had to play a part veritably to act one came stronger and stronger upon him and filled him with bitter doubt as to his power Still he went on boldly It had been a part of his plan to seem to come eagerly as a lover should come and so he came When he got close to Stephen all the witchery of her presence came upon him as of old After all he loved her with his whole soul and the chance had come to tell her so Even under the distressing conditions of his suit the effort had its charm Stephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him and that too since the effort was based on truth came with a certain ease to her At the present time in her present frame of mind nothing in the wide world could give her pleasure the ease which came if it did not change her purpose increased her power Their usual salutation begun when she was a little baby was Good morning Stephen Good morning Harold It had become so much a custom that now it came mechanically on her part The tender reference to childhood s days though it touched her companion to the quick did not appeal to her since she had no special thought of it Had such a thought come to her it might have softened her even to tears for Harold had been always deep in her heart As might have been expected from her character and condition of mind she was the first to begin I suppose you want to see me about something special Harold you have come so early Yes Stephen Very special Were you at the house she asked in a voice whose quietness might have conveyed a warning She was so suspicious now that she suspected even Harold of of what she did not know He answered in all simplicity No I came straight here How did you know I should be here Her voice was now not only quiet but sweet Without thinking Harold blundered on His intention was so single minded and his ignorance of woman so complete that he did not recognise even elementary truths I knew you always came here long ago when you were a child when you were in Here it suddenly flashed upon him that if he seemed to expect that she was in trouble as he had purposed saying he would give away his knowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work to which he had set himself So he finished the sentence in a lame and impotent manner which however saved complete annihilation as it was verbally accurate in short frocks Stephen needed to know little more Her quick intelligence grasped the fact that there was some purpose afoot which she did not know or understand She surmised of course that it was some way in connection with her mad act and she grew cooler in her brain as well as colder in her heart as she prepared to learn more Stephen had changed from girl to woman in the last twenty four hours and all the woman in her was now awake After a moment s pause she said with a winning smile Why Harold I ve been in long frocks for years Why should I come here on this special day on that account Even as she was speaking she felt that it would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry It had clearly told her all it could She would learn more by some other means So she went on in a playful way as a cat not a kitten does when it has got a mouse That reason won t work Harold It s quite rusty in the joints But never mind it Tell me why you have come so early This seemed to Harold to be a heaven sent opening he rushed in at once Because Stephen I wanted to ask you to be my wife Oh Stephen don t you know that I love you Ever since you were a little girl When you were a little girl and I a big boy I loved you I have loved you ever since with all my heart and soul and strength Without you the world is a blank to me For you and your happiness I would do anything anything This was no acting When once the barrier of beginning had been broken his soul seemed to pour itself out The man was vibrant through all his nature and the woman s very soul realised its truth For an instant a flame,bramStoker
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore But who could show a cheek like Queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the Andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone Grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast They say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite self possessed in company Not always though Ledyard the great New England traveller and Mungo Park the Scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of Africa which was the sum of poor Mungo s performances this kind of travel I say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish Still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence And not only that but they looked embarrassed Yes here were a set of sea dogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas entire strangers to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains A curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen But as for Queequeg why Queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle To be sure I can not say much for his breeding His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him But that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in most people s estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly We will not speak of all Queequeg s peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare Enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk pipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when I sallied out for a stroll CHAPTER The Street If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford In thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays and at Bombay in the Apollo Green live Yankees have often scared the natives But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping In these last mentioned haunts you see only sailors but in New Bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh It makes a stranger stare But besides the Feegeeans Tongatobooarrs Erromanggoans Pannangians and Brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery They are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale lance Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came In some things you would think them but a few hours old Look there that chap strutting round the corner He wears a beaver hat and swallow tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife Here comes another with a sou wester and a bombazine cloak No town bred dandy will compare with a country bred one I mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that in the dog days will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whale fishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport In bespeaking his sea outfit he orders bell buttons to his waistcoats straps to his canvas trowsers Ah poor Hay Seed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors Not at all Still New Bedford is a queer place Had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador As it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all New England It is a land of oil true enough but not like Canaan

the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake skin with my hands Well here s your bad luck We ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day Jim Never you mind honey never you mind Don t you git too peart It s a comin Mind I tell you it s a comin It did come too It was a Tuesday that we had that talk Well after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge and got out of tobacco I went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnake in there I killed him and curled him up on the foot of Jim s blanket ever so natural thinking there d be some fun when Jim found him there Well by night I forgot all about the snake and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake s mate was there and bit him He jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring I laid him out in a second with a stick and Jim grabbed pap s whisky jug and begun to pour it down He was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it Jim told me to chop off the snake s head and throw it away and then skin the body and roast a piece of it I done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist too He said that that would help Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for I warn t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault not if I could help it Jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again His foot swelled up pretty big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so I judged he was all right but I d druther been bit with a snake than pap s whisky Jim was laid up for four days and nights Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again I made up my mind I wouldn t ever take a holt of a snake skin again with my hands now that I see what had come of it Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time And he said that handling a snake skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn t got to the end of it yet He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake skin in his hand Well I was getting to feel that way myself though I ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do Old Hank Bunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot tower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but I didn t see it Pap told me But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way like a fool Well the days went along and the river went down between its banks again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds We couldn t handle him of course he would a flung us into Illinois We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of rubbage We split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it Jim said he d had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi I reckon Jim said he hadn t ever seen a bigger one He would a been worth a good deal over at the village They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market house there everybody buys some of him his meat s as white as snow and makes a good fry Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull and I wanted to get a stirring up some way I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on Jim liked that notion but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp Then he studied it over and said couldn t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl That was a good notion too So we shortened up one of the calico gowns and I turned up my trouser legs to my knees and got into it Jim hitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit I put,markTwain
pleased at the discovery that the garden was not as deserted as it looked but now she hailed the fact of the child s presence on the scene with absolute relief Little girl can you find some one to drive away she began hopefully Comment Comprends pas was the response Oh are you French tes vous fran aise Pas de tous Suis anglaise Then why not talk English I want to know if Permettez moi expliquer You see I m rather under a cloud said Matilda I m staying with my aunt and I was told I must behave particularly well to day as lots of people were coming for a garden party and I was told to imitate Claude that s my young cousin who never does anything wrong except by accident and then is always apologetic about it It seems they thought I ate too much raspberry trifle at lunch and they said Claude never eats too much raspberry trifle Well Claude always goes to sleep for half an hour after lunch because he s told to and I waited till he was asleep and tied his hands and started forcible feeding with a whole bucketful of raspberry trifle that they were keeping for the garden party Lots of it went on to his sailor suit and some of it on to the bed but a good deal went down Claude s throat and they can t say again that he has never been known to eat too much raspberry trifle That is why I am not allowed to go to the party and as an additional punishment I must speak French all the afternoon I ve had to tell you all this in English as there were words like forcible feeding that I didn t know the French for of course I could have invented them but if I had said nourriture obligatoire you wouldn t have had the least idea what I was talking about Mais maintenant nous parlons fran ais Oh very well tr s bien said Mrs Stossen reluctantly in moments of flurry such French as she knew was not under very good control L l autre c t de la porte est un cochon Un cochon Ah le petit charmant exclaimed Matilda with enthusiasm Mais non pas du tout petit et pas du tout charmant un b te f roce Une b te corrected Matilda a pig is masculine as long as you call it a pig but if you lose your temper with it and call it a ferocious beast it becomes one of us at once French is a dreadfully unsexing language For goodness sake let us talk English then said Mrs Stossen Is there any way out of this garden except through the paddock where the pig is I always go over the wall by way of the plum tree said Matilda Dressed as we are we could hardly do that said Mrs Stossen it was difficult to imagine her doing it in any costume Do you think you could go and get some one who would drive the pig away asked Miss Stossen I promised my aunt I would stay here till five o clock it s not four yet I am sure under the circumstances your aunt would permit My conscience would not permit said Matilda with cold dignity We can t stay here till five o clock exclaimed Mrs Stossen with growing exasperation Shall I recite to you to make the time pass quicker asked Matilda obligingly Belinda the little Breadwinner is considered my best piece or perhaps it ought to be something in French Henri Quatre s address to his soldiers is the only thing I really know in that language If you will go and fetch some one to drive that animal away I will give you something to buy yourself a nice present said Mrs Stossen Matilda came several inches lower down the medlar tree That is the most practical suggestion you have made yet for getting out of the garden she remarked cheerfully Claude and I are collecting money for the Children s Fresh Air Fund and we are seeing which of us can collect the biggest sum I shall be very glad to contribute half a crown very glad indeed said Mrs Stossen digging that coin out of the depths of a receptacle which formed a detached outwork of her toilet Claude is a long way ahead of me at present continued Matilda taking no notice of the suggested offering you see he s only eleven and has golden hair and those are enormous advantages when you re on the collecting job Only the other day a Russian lady gave him ten shillings Russians understand the art of giving far better than we do I expect Claude will net quite twenty five shillings this afternoon he ll have the field to himself and he ll be able to do the pale fragile not long for this world business to perfection after his raspberry trifle experience Yes he ll be quite two pounds ahead of me by now With much probing and plucking and many regretful murmurs the beleaguered ladies managed to produce seven and sixpence between them I am afraid this is all we ve got said Mrs Stossen Matilda showed no sign of coming down either to the earth or to their figure I could not do violence to my conscience for anything less than ten shillings she announced stiffly Mother and daughter muttered certain remarks under their breath in which the word beast was prominent and probably had no reference to Tarquin I find I have got another half crown said Mrs Stossen in a shaking

to think of We ve been through some hard days and I seem to have known you a long time Jennie appeared shy almost sad so Duane changed the subject to something less personal Andrews returned one evening from a several days trip to Huntsville Duane everybody s talkie about how you cleaned up the Bland outfit he said important and full of news It s some exaggerated accordin to what you told me but you ve shore made friends on this side of the Nueces I reckon there ain t a town where you wouldn t find people to welcome you Huntsville you know is some divided in its ideas Half the people are crooked Likely enough all them who was so loud in praise of you are the crookedest For instance I met King Fisher the boss outlaw of these parts Well King thinks he s a decent citizen He was tellin me what a grand job yours was for the border an honest cattlemen Now that Bland and Alloway are done for King Fisher will find rustlin easier There s talk of Hardin movie his camp over to Bland s But I don t know how true it is I reckon there ain t much to it In the past when a big outlaw chief went under his band almost always broke up an scattered There s no one left who could run thet outfit Did you hear of any outlaws hunting me asked Duane Nobody from Bland s outfit is huntin you thet s shore replied Andrews Fisher said there never was a hoss straddled to go on your trail Nobody had any use for Bland Anyhow his men would be afraid to trail you An you could go right in to Huntsville where you d be some popular Reckon you d be safe too except when some of them fool saloon loafers or bad cowpunchers would try to shoot you for the glory in it Them kind of men will bob up everywhere you go Duane I ll be able to ride and take care of myself in a day or two went on Duane Then I ll go I d like to talk to you about Jennie She s welcome to a home here with us Thank you Andrews You re a kind man But I want Jennie to get farther away from the Rio Grande She d never be safe here Besides she may be able to find relatives She has some though she doesn t know where they are All right Duane Whatever you think best I reckon now you d better take her to some town Go north an strike for Shelbyville or Crockett Them s both good towns I ll tell Jennie the names of men who ll help her You needn t ride into town at all Which place is nearer and how far is it Shelbyville I reckon about two days ride Poor stock country so you ain t liable to meet rustlers All the same better hit the trail at night an go careful At sunset two days later Duane and Jennie mounted their horses and said good by to the rancher and his wife Andrews would not listen to Duane s thanks I tell you I m beholden to you yet he declared Well what can I do for you asked Duane I may come along here again some day Get down an come in then or you re no friend of mine I reckon there ain t nothin I can think of I just happen to remember Here he led Duane out of earshot of the women and went on in a whisper Buck I used to be well to do Got skinned by a man named Brown Rodney Brown He lives in Huntsville an he s my enemy I never was much on fightin or I d fixed him Brown ruined me stole all I had He s a hoss an cattle thief an he has pull enough at home to protect him I reckon I needn t say any more Is this Brown a man who shot an outlaw named Stevens queried Duane curiously Shore he s the same I heard thet story Brown swears he plugged Stevens through the middle But the outlaw rode off an nobody ever knew for shore Luke Stevens died of that shot I buried him said Duane Andrews made no further comment and the two men returned to the women The main road for about three miles then where it forks take the left hand road and keep on straight That what you said Andrews Shore An good luck to you both Duane and Jennie trotted away into the gathering twilight At the moment an insistent thought bothered Duane Both Luke Stevens and the rancher Andrews had hinted to Duane to kill a man named Brown Duane wished with all his heart that they had not mentioned it let alone taken for granted the execution of the deed What a bloody place Texas was Men who robbed and men who were robbed both wanted murder It was in the spirit of the country Duane certainly meant to avoid ever meeting this Rodney Brown And that very determination showed Duane how dangerous he really was to men and to himself Sometimes he had a feeling of how little stood between his sane and better self and a self utterly wild and terrible He reasoned that only intelligence could save him only a thoughtful understanding of his danger and a hold upon some ideal Then he fell into low conversation with Jennie holding out hopeful views of her future and presently darkness set in The sky was overcast with heavy clouds there was no air moving the heat and oppression threatened storm By and by Duane could not see a rod in front of him though his horse had no difficulty in keeping to the road Duane was bothered,zaneGrey
matter has been upheaved to as great a height as the crater down which it flowed and probably even to a greater height It is interesting thus to trace the steps by which the structure of a volcanic district becomes obscured and finally obliterated so near to this last stage is St Helena that I believe no one has hitherto suspected that the central ridge or axis of the island is the last wreck of the crater whence the most modern volcanic streams were poured forth The great hollow space or valley southward of the central curved ridge across which the half of the crater must once have extended is formed of bare water worn hillocks and ridges of red yellow and brown rocks mingled together in chaos like confusion interlaced by dikes and without any regular stratification The chief part consists of red decomposing scoriae associated with various kinds of tuff and yellow argillaceous beds full of broken crystals those of augite being particularly large Here and there masses of highly cellular and amygdaloidal lavas protrude From one of the ridges in the midst of the valley a conical precipitous hill called Lot boldly stands up and forms a most singular and conspicuous object It is composed of phonolite divided in one part into great curved laminae in another into angular concretionary balls and in a third part into outwardly radiating columns At its base the strata of lava tuff and scoriae dip away on all sides Abich in his Views of Vesuvius plate has shown the manner in which beds under nearly similar circumstances are tilted up The upper beds are more turned up than the lower and he accounts for this by showing that the lava insinuates itself horizontally between the lower beds the uncovered portion is feet in height This height is given by Mr Seale in his Geognosy of the island The height of the summit above the level of the sea is said to be feet and its horizontal section gives an oval figure The phonolite is of a greenish grey colour and is full of minute acicular crystals of feldspar in most parts it has a conchoidal fracture and is sonorous yet it is crenulated with minute air cavities In a S W direction from Lot there are some other remarkable columnar pinnacles but of a less regular shape namely Lot s Wife and the Asses Ears composed of allied kinds of rock From their flattened shape and their relative position to each other they are evidently connected on the same line of fissure It is moreover remarkable that this same N E and S W line joining Lot and Lot s Wife if prolonged would intersect Flagstaff Hill which as before stated is crossed by numerous dikes running in this direction and which has a disturbed structure rendering it probable that a great body of once fluid rock lies injected beneath it In this same great valley there are several other conical masses of injected rock one I observed was composed of compact greenstone some of which are not connected as far as is apparent with any line of dike whilst others are obviously thus connected Of these dikes three or four great lines stretch across the valley in a N E and S W direction parallel to that one connecting the Asses Ears Lot s Wife and probably Lot The number of these masses of injected rock is a remarkable feature in the geology of St Helena Besides those just mentioned and the hypothetical one beneath Flagstaff Hill there is Little Stony top and others as I have reason to believe at the Man and Horse and at High Hill Most of these masses if not all of them have been injected subsequently to the last volcanic eruptions from the central crater The formation of conical bosses of rock on lines of fissure the walls of which are in most cases parallel may probably be attributed to inequalities in the tension causing small transverse fissures and at these points of intersection the edges of the strata would naturally yield and be easily turned upwards Finally I may remark that hills of phonolite everywhere are apt to assume singular and even grotesque shapes like that of Lot D Aubuisson in his Traite de Geognosie tome page particularly remarks that this is the case the peak at Fernando Noronha offers an instance at St Jago however the cones of phonolite though tapering have a regular form Supposing as seems probable that all such hillocks or obelisks have originally been injected whilst liquified into a mould formed by yielding strata as certainly has been the case with Lot how are we to account for the frequent abruptness and singularity of their outlines compared with similarly injected masses of greenstone and basalt Can it be due to a less perfect degree of fluidity which is generally supposed to be characteristic of the allied trachytic lavas SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS Soft calcareous sandstone occurs in extensive though thin superficial beds both on the northern and southern shores of the island It consists of very minute equal sized rounded particles of shells and other organic bodies which partially retain their yellow brown and pink colours and occasionally though very rarely present an obscure trace of their original external forms I in vain endeavoured to find a single unrolled fragment of a shell The colour of the particles is the most obvious character by which their origin can be recognised the tints being affected and an odour produced by a moderate heat in the same manner as in fresh shells The particles are cemented together and are mingled with some earthy matter the purest masses according to Beatson contain per cent of carbonate of lime The beds varying in thickness from two or three feet to fifteen feet coat the surface of the ground they generally lie on that side of the valley which is protected from the wind and,charlesDarwin
and its face to the shimmering violet haze which hung round the huge sweep of beautiful terrible desert striped tiger fashion with black rock and with golden sand None of the white prisoners with the exception of Colonel Cochrane had ever been upon a camel before It seemed an alarming distance to the ground when they looked down and the curious swaying motion with the insecurity of the saddle made them sick and frightened But their bodily discomfort was forgotten in the turmoil of bitter thoughts within What a chasm gaped between their old life and their new And yet how short was the time and space which divided them Less than an hour ago they had stood upon the summit of that rock and had laughed and chattered or grumbled at the heat and flies becoming peevish at small discomforts Headingly had been hypercritical over the tints of Nature They could not forget his own tint as he lay with his cheek upon the black stone Sadie had chattered about tailor made dresses and Parisian chiffons Now she was clinging half crazy to the pommel of a wooden saddle with suicide rising as a red star of hope in her mind Humanity reason argument all were gone and there remained the brutal humiliation of force And all the time down there by the second rocky point their steamer was waiting for them their saloon with the white napery and the glittering glasses the latest novel and the London papers The least imaginative of them could see it so clearly the white awning Mrs Shlesinger with her yellow sun hat Mrs Belmont lying back in the canvas chair There it lay almost in sight of them that little floating chip broken off from home and every silent ungainly step of the camels was carrying them more hopelessly away from it That very morning how beneficent Providence had appeared how pleasant was life a little commonplace perhaps but so soothing and restful And now The red head gear patched jibbehs and yellow boots had already shown to the Colonel that these men were no wandering party of robbers but a troop from the regular army of the Khalifa Now as they struck across the desert they showed that they possessed the rude discipline which their work demanded A mile ahead and far out on either flank rode their scouts dipping and rising among the yellow sand hills Ali Wad Ibrahim headed the caravan and his short sturdy lieutenant brought up the rear The main party straggled over a couple of hundred yards and in the middle was the little dejected clump of prisoners No attempt was made to keep them apart and Mr Stephens soon contrived that his camel should be between those of the two ladies Don t be down hearted Miss Adams said he This is a most indefensible outrage but there can be no question that steps will be taken in the proper quarter to set the matter right I am convinced that we shall be subjected to nothing worse than a temporary inconvenience If it had not been for that villain Mansoor you need not have appeared at all It was shocking to see the change in the little Bostonian lady for she had shrunk to an old woman in an hour Her swarthy cheeks had fallen in and her eyes shone wildly from sunken darkened sockets Her frightened glances were continually turned upon Sadie There is surely some wrecker angel which can only gather her best treasures in moments of disaster For here were all these worldlings going to their doom and already frivolity and selfishness had passed away from them and each was thinking and grieving only for the other Sadie thought of her aunt her aunt thought of Sadie the men thought of the women Belmont thought of his wife and then he thought of something else also and he kicked his camel s shoulder with his heel until he found himself upon the near side of Miss Adams I ve got something for you here he whispered We may be separated soon so it is as well to make our arrangements Separated wailed Miss Adams Don t speak loud for that infernal Mansoor may give us away again I hope it won t be so but it might We must be prepared for the worst For example they might determine to get rid of us men and to keep you Miss Adams shuddered What am I to do For God s sake tell me what I am to do Mr Belmont I am an old woman I have had my day I could stand it if it was only myself But Sadie I am clean crazed when I think of her There s her mother waiting at home and I She clasped her thin hands together in the agony of her thoughts Put your hand out under your dust cloak said Belmont sidling his camel up against hers Don t miss your grip of it There Now hide it in your dress and you ll always have a key to unlock any door Miss Adams felt what it was which he had slipped into her hand and she looked at him for a moment in bewilderment Then she pursed up her lips and shook her stern brown face in disapproval But she pushed the little pistol into its hiding place all the same and she rode with her thoughts in a whirl Could this indeed be she Eliza Adams of Boston whose narrow happy life had oscillated between the comfortable house in Commonwealth Avenue and the Tremont Presbyterian Church Here she was hunched upon a camel with her hand upon the butt of a pistol and her mind weighing the justifications of murder Oh life sly sleek treacherous life how are we ever to trust you Show us your worst and we can face it but it is when you are sweetest and,arthurDoyle
herself on Saturday I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when Mr Denny comes back from town Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but Mr Collins much offended laid aside his book and said I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit It amazes me I confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction But I will no longer importune my young cousin Then turning to Mr Bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon Mr Bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements Mrs Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but Mr Collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with Mr Bennet and prepared for backgammon Chapter Mr Collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility Having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part His plan did not vary on seeing them Miss Bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice The next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s t te t te with Mrs Bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged Mr Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs Bennet was stirring the fire Elizabeth equally next to Jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course Mrs Bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces Lydia s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten every sister except Mary agreed to go with her and Mr Collins was to attend them at the request of Mr Bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither Mr Collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to Mr Bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at Hunsford Such doings discomposed Mr Bennet exceedingly In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told Elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting Mr Collins to join his daughters in their walk and Mr Collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go In pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered Meryton The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the way The officer was the very Mr Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to enquire and he bowed as they passed All were struck with the stranger s air all wondered,janeAusten
myself at Almack s The rooms were crowded to suffocation He is coming said somebody on the staircase He is coming said somebody farther up He is coming said somebody farther still He is come exclaimed the Duchess He is come the little love and seizing me firmly by both hands she kissed me thrice upon the nose A marked sensation immediately ensued Diavolo cried Count Capricornutti Dios guarda muttered Don Stiletto Mille tonnerres ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille Tousand teufel growled the Elector of Bluddennuff It was not to be borne I grew angry I turned short upon Bluddennuff Sir said I to him you are a baboon Sir he replied after a pause Donner und Blitzen This was all that could be desired We exchanged cards At Chalk Farm the next morning I shot off his nose and then called upon my friends B te said the first Fool said the second Dolt said the third Ass said the fourth Ninny said the fifth Noodle said the sixth Be off said the seventh At all this I felt mortified and so called upon my father Father I asked what is the chief end of my existence My son he replied it is still the study of Nosology but in hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark You have a fine nose it is true but then Bluddennuff has none You are damned and he has become the hero of the day I grant you that in Fum Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis but good heavens there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all X ING A PARAGRAB As it is well known that the wise men came from the East and as Mr Touch and go Bullet head came from the East it follows that Mr Bullet head was a wise man and if collateral proof of the matter be needed here we have it Mr B was an editor Irascibility was his sole foible for in fact the obstinacy of which men accused him was anything but his foible since he justly considered it his forte It was his strong point his virtue and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to convince him that it was anything else I have shown that Touch and go Bullet head was a wise man and the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible was when abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men the East he migrated to the city of Alexander the Great o nopolis or some place of a similar title out West I must do him the justice to say however that when he made up his mind finally to settle in that town it was under the impression that no newspaper and consequently no editor existed in that particular section of the country In establishing The Tea Pot he expected to have the field all to himself I feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in Alexander the Great o nopolis had he been aware that in Alexander the Great o nopolis there lived a gentleman named John Smith if I rightly remember who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the Alexander the Great o nopolis Gazette It was solely therefore on account of having been misinformed that Mr Bullet head found himself in Alex suppose we call it Nopolis for short but as he did find himself there he determined to keep up his character for obst for firmness and remain So remain he did and he did more he unpacked his press type etc etc rented an office exactly opposite to that of the Gazette and on the third morning after his arrival issued the first number of The Alexan that is to say of The Nopolis Tea Pot as nearly as I can recollect this was the name of the new paper The leading article I must admit was brilliant not to say severe It was especially bitter about things in general and as for the editor of The Gazette he was torn all to pieces in particular Some of Bullet head s remarks were really so fiery that I have always since that time been forced to look upon John Smith who is still alive in the light of a salamander I can not pretend to give all the Tea Pot s paragraphs verbatim but one of them runs thus Oh yes Oh we perceive Oh no doubt The editor over the way is a genius O my Oh goodness gracious what is this world coming to Oh tempora Oh Moses A philippic at once so caustic and so classical alighted like a bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis Groups of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets Every one awaited with heartfelt anxiety the reply of the dignified Smith Next morning it appeared as follows We quote from The Tea Pot of yesterday the subjoined paragraph Oh yes Oh we perceive Oh no doubt Oh my Oh goodness Oh tempora Oh Moses Why the fellow is all O That accounts for his reasoning in a circle and explains why there is neither beginning nor end to him nor to anything he says We really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn t an O in it Wonder if this O ing is a habit of his By the by he came away from Down East in a great hurry Wonder if he O s as much there as he does here O it is pitiful The indignation of Mr Bullet head at these scandalous insinuations I shall not attempt to describe On the eel skinning principle however he did not seem to be so much incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have imagined,allanPoe
