Charles Darwin,", where freely exposed to the swell of the open sea . ) It has , however , been doubted by MM . Quoy and Gaimard , whether any kind of coral can even withstand , much less flourish in , the breakers of an open sea ( `` Annales des Sciences Naturelles , '' tome vi. , pages 276 , 278. -- '' La ou les ondes sont agitees , les Lytophytes ne peuvent travailler , parce qu'elles detruiraient leurs fragiles edifices , '' etc . ) : they affirm that the saxigenous lithophytes flourish only where the water is tranquil , and the heat intense . This statement has passed from one geological work to another ; nevertheless , the protection of the whole reef undoubtedly is due to those kinds of coral , which can not exist in the situations thought by these naturalists to be most favourable to them . For should the outer and living margin perish , of any one of the many low coral-islands , round which a line of great breakers is incessantly foaming , the whole , it is scarcely possible to doubt , would be washed away and destroyed , in less than half a century . But the vital energies of the corals conquer the mechanical power of the waves ; and the large fragments of reef torn up by every storm , are replaced by the slow but steady growth of the innumerable polypifers , which form the living zone on its outer edge . From these facts , it is certain , that the strongest and most massive corals flourish , where most exposed . The less perfect state of the reef of most atolls on the leeward and less exposed side , compared with its state to windward ; and the analogous case of the greater number of breaches on the near sides of those atolls in the Maldiva Archipelago , which afford some protection to each other , are obviously explained by this circumstance . If the question had been , under what conditions the greater number of species of coral , not regarding their bulk and strength , were developed , I should answer , -- probably in the situations described by MM . Quoy and Gaimard , where the water is tranquil and the heat intense . The total number of species of coral in the circumtropical seas must be very great : in the Red Sea alone , 120 kinds , according to Ehrenberg ( Ehrenberg , `` Uber die Natur , '' etc. , etc. , page 46 . ) , have been observed . The same author has observed that the recoil of the sea from a steep shore is injurious to the growth of coral , although waves breaking over a bank are not so . Ehrenberg also states , that where there is much sediment , placed so as to be liable to be moved by the waves there is little or no coral ; and a collection of living specimens placed by him on a sandy shore died in the course of a few days . ( Ibid. , page 49 . ) An experiment , however , will presently be related in which some large masses of living coral increased rapidly in size , after having been secured by stakes on a sandbank . That loose sediment should be injurious to the living polypifers , appears , at first sight , probable ; and accordingly , in sounding off Keeling atoll , and ( as will hereafter be shown ) off Mauritius , the arming of the lead invariably came up clean , where the coral was growing vigorously . This same circumstance has probably given rise to a strange belief , which , according to Captain Owen ( Captain Owen on the Geography of the Maldiva Islands , `` Geographical Journal '' , volume ii. , page 88 . ) , is general amongst the inhabitants of the Maldiva atolls , namely that corals have roots , and therefore that if merely broken down to the surface , they grow up again ; but , if rooted out , they are permanently destroyed . By this means the inhabitants keep their harbours clear ; and thus the French Governor of St. Mary 's in Madagascar , `` cleared out and made a beautiful little port at that place . '' For it is probable that sand would accumulate in the hollows formed by tearing out the corals , but not on the broken and projecting stumps , and therefore , in the former case , the fresh growth of the coral might be thus prevented . In the last chapter I remarked that fringing-reefs are almost universally breached , where streams enter the sea . ( Lieutenant Wellstead and others have remarked that this is the case in the Red Sea ; Dr. Ruppell ( `` Reise in Abyss . '' Band . i. , page 142 ) says that there are pear-shaped harbours in the upraised coral-coast , into which periodical streams enter . From this circumstance , I presume , we must infer that before the upheaval of the strata now forming the coast-land , fresh water and sediment entered the sea at these points ; and the coral being thus prevented growing , the pear-shaped harbours were produced . ) Most authors have attributed this fact to the injurious effects of the fresh water , even where it enters the sea only in small quantity , and during a part of the year . No doubt brackish water would prevent or retard the growth of coral ; but I believe that the mud and sand which is deposited , even by rivulets when flooded , is a much more efficient check . The reef on each side of the channel leading into Port Louis at Mauritius , ends abruptly in a wall , at the foot of which I sounded and found a bed of thick mud . This steepness of the sides appears to be a general character in such breaches . Cook ( Cook 's `` First Voyage , '' volume ii. , page 271 ( Hawkesworth 's edition ) . ) , speaking of one at Raiatea , says , '' like all the rest , it is very steep on both sides . '' Now , if it were the fresh water mingling with the salt which prevented the growth of coral , the reef certainly would not terminate abruptly , but as the polypifers nearest the impure stream would grow less vigorously than those farther off , so would the reef gradually thin away . On the other hand , the sediment brought down from the land would only prevent the growth of the coral in the line of its deposition , but would not check it on the side , so that the reefs might increase till they overhung the bed of the channel . The breaches are much fewer in number , and front only the larger valleys in reefs of the encircling barrier class . They probably are kept open in the same manner as those into the lagoon of an atoll , namely , by the force of the currents and the drifting outwards of fine sediment . Their position in front of valleys , although often separated from the land by deep water lagoon-channels , which it might be thought would entirely remove the injurious effects both of the fresh water and the sediment , will receive a simple explanation when we discuss the origin of barrier-reefs . In the vegetable kingdom every different station has its peculiar group of plants , and similar relations appear to prevail with corals . We have already described the great difference between the corals within the lagoon of an atoll and those on its outer margin . The corals , also , on the margin of Keeling Island occurred in zones ; thus the Porites and Millepora complanata grow to a large size only where they are washed by a heavy sea , and are killed by a short exposure to the air ; whereas , three species of Nullipora also live amidst the breakers , but are able to survive uncovered for a part of each tide ; at greater depths , a strong Madrepora and Millepora alcicornis are the commonest kinds , the former appearing to be confined to this part , beneath the zone of massive corals , minute encrusting corallines and other organic bodies live . If we compare the external margin of the reef at Keeling atoll with that on the leeward side of Mauritius , which are very differently circumstanced , we shall find a corresponding difference in the appearance of the corals . At the latter place , the genus Madrepora is preponderant over every other kind , and beneath the zone of massive corals there are large beds of Seriatopora . There is also a marked difference , according to Captain Moresby ( Captain Moresby on the Northern Maldiva atolls , `` Geographical Journal '' , volume v. , page 401 . ) , between the great branching corals of the Red Sea , and those on the reefs of the Maldiva atolls . These facts , which in themselves are deserving of notice , bear , perhaps , not very remotely , on a remarkable circumstance which has been pointed out to me by Captain Moresby , namely , that with very few exceptions , none of the coral-knolls within the lagoons of Peros Banhos , Diego Garcia , and the Great Chagos Bank ( all situated in the Chagos group ) , rise to the surface of the water ; whereas all those , with equally few exceptions , within Solomon and Egmont atolls in the same group , and likewise within the large southern Maldiva atolls , reach the surface . I make these statements , after having examined the charts of each atoll . In the lagoon of Peros Banhos , which is nearly twenty miles across , there is only one single reef which rises to the surface ; in Diego Garcia there are seven , but several of these lie close to the margin of the lagoon , and need scarcely have been reckoned ; in the Great Chagos Bank there is not one . On the other hand , in the lagoons of some of the great southern Maldiva atolls , although thickly studded with reefs , every one without exception rises to the surface ; and on an average there are less than two submerged reefs in each atoll ; in the northern atolls , however , the submerged lagoon-reefs are not quite so rare . The submerged reefs in the Chagos atolls generally have from one to seven fathoms water on them , but some have from seven to ten . Most of them are small with very steep sides ( Some of these statements were not communicated to me verbally by Captain Moresby , but are taken from the MS. account before alluded to , of the Chagos Group . ) ; at Peros Banhos they rise from a depth of about thirty fathoms , and some of them in the Great Chagos Bank from above forty fathoms ; they are covered , Captain Moresby informs me , with living and healthy coral , two and three feet high , consisting of several species . Why then have not these lagoon-reefs reached the surface , like the innumerable ones in the atolls above named ? If we attempt to assign any difference in their external conditions , as the cause of this diversity , we are at once baffled . The lagoon of Diego Garcia is not deep , and is almost wholly surrounded by its reef ; Peros Banhos is very deep , much larger , with many wide passages communicating with the open sea . On the other hand , of those atolls , in which all or nearly all the lagoon-reefs have reached the surface , some are small , others large , some shallow , others deep , some well-enclosed , and others open . Captain Moresby informs me that he has seen a French chart of Diego Garcia made eighty years before his survey , and apparently very accurate ; and from it he infers , that during this interval there has not been the smallest change in the depth on any of the knolls within the lagoon . It is also known that during the last fifty-one years , the eastern channel into the lagoon has neither become narrower , nor decreased in depth ; and as there are numerous small knolls of living coral within it , some change might have been anticipated . Moreover , as the whole reef round the lagoon of this atoll has been converted into land -- an unparalleled case , I believe , in an atoll of such large size , -- and as the strip of land is for considerable spaces more than half a mile wide -- also a very unusual circumstance , -- we have the best possible evidence , that Diego Garcia has remained at its present level for a very long period . With this fact , and with the knowledge that no sensible change has taken place during eighty years in the coral-knolls , and considering that every single reef has reached the surface in other atolls , which do not present the smallest appearance of being older than Diego Garcia and Peros Banhos , and which are placed under the same external conditions with them , one is led to conclude that these submerged reefs , although covered with luxuriant coral , have no tendency to grow upwards , and that they would remain at their present levels for an almost indefinite period . From the number of these knolls , from their position , size , and form , many of them being only one or two hundred yards across , with a rounded outline , and precipitous sides , -- it is indisputable that they have been formed by the growth of coral ; and this makes the case much more remarkable . In Peros Banhos and in the Great Chagos Bank , some of these almost columnar masses are 200 feet high , and their summits lie only from two to eight fathoms beneath the surface ; therefore , a small proportional amount more of growth would cause them to attain the surface , like those numerous knolls , which rise from an equally great depth within the Maldiva atolls . We can hardly suppose that time has been wanting for the upward growth of the coral , whilst in Diego Garcia , the broad annular strip of land , formed by the continued accumulation of detritus , shows how long this atoll has remained at its present level . We must look to some other cause than the rate of growth ; and I suspect it will be found in the reefs being formed of different species of corals , adapted to live at different depths . The Great Chagos Bank is situated in the centre of the Chagos Group , and the Pitt and Speaker Banks at its two extreme points . These banks resemble atolls , except in their external rim being about eight fathoms submerged , and in being formed of dead rock , with very little living coral on it : a portion nine miles long of the annular reef of Peros Banhos atoll is in the same condition . These facts , as will hereafter be shown , render it very probable that the whole group at some former period subsided seven or eight fathoms ; and that the coral perished on the outer margin of those atolls which are now submerged , but that it continued alive , and grew up to the surface on those which are now perfect . If these atolls did subside , and if from the suddenness of the movement or from any other cause , those corals which are better adapted to live at a certain depth than at the surface , once got possession of the knolls , supplanting the former occupants , they would exert little or no tendency to grow upwards . To illustrate this , I may observe , that if the corals of the upper zone on the outer edge of Keeling atoll were to perish , it is improbable that those of the lower zone would grow to the surface , and thus become exposed to conditions for which they do not appear to be adapted . The conjecture , that the corals on the submerged knolls within the Chagos atolls have analogous habits with those of the lower zone outside Keeling atoll , receives some support from a remark by Captain Moresby , namely , that they have a different appearance from those on the reefs in the Maldiva atolls , which , as we have seen , all rise to the surface : he compares the kind of difference to that of the vegetation under different climates . I have entered at considerable length into this case , although unable to throw much light on it , in order to show that an equal tendency to upward growth ought not to be attributed to all coral-reefs , -- to those situated at different depths , -- to those forming the ring of an atoll or those on the knolls within a lagoon , -- to those in one area and those in another . The inference , therefore , that one reef could not grow up to the surface within a given time , because another , not known to be covered with the same species of corals , and not known to be placed under conditions exactly the same , has not within the same time reached the surface , is unsound . SECTION 4.II. -- ON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF CORAL-REEFS . The remark made at the close of the last section , naturally leads to this division of our subject , which has not , I think , hitherto been considered under a right point of view . Ehrenberg ( Ehrenberg , as before cited , pages 39 , 46 , and 50 . ) has stated , that in the Red Sea , the corals only coat other rocks in a layer from one to two feet in thickness , or at most to a fathom and a half ; and he disbelieves that , in any case , they form , by their own proper growth , great masses , stratum over stratum . A nearly similar observation has been made by MM . Quoy and Gaimard ( `` Annales des Sciences Nat . '' tom . vi. , page 28 . ) , with respect to the thickness of some upraised beds of coral , which they examined at Timor and some other places . Ehrenberg ( Ehrenberg , ut sup. , page 42 . ) saw certain large massive corals in the Red Sea , which he imagines to be of such vast antiquity , that they might have been beheld by Pharaoh ; and according to Mr. Lyell ( Lyell's '' Principles of Geology , '' book iii. , chapter xviii . ) there are certain corals at Bermuda , which are known by tradition , to have been living for centuries . To show how slowly coral-reefs grow upwards , Captain Beechey ( Beechey 's `` Voyage to the Pacific , '' chapter viii . ) has adduced the case of the Dolphin Reef off Tahiti , which has remained at the same depth beneath the surface , namely about two fathoms and a half , for a period of sixty-seven years . There are reefs in the Red Sea , which certainly do not appear ( Ehrenberg , ut sup. , page 43 . ) to have increased in dimensions during the last half-century , and from the comparison of old charts with recent surveys , probably not during the last two hundred years . These , and other similar facts , have so strongly impressed many with the belief of the extreme slowness of the growth of corals , that they have even doubted the possibility of islands in the great oceans having been formed by their agency . Others , again , who have not been overwhelmed by this difficulty , have admitted that it would require thousands , and tens of thousands of years , to form a mass , even of inconsiderable thickness ; but the subject has not , I believe , been viewed in the proper light . That masses of considerable thickness have been formed by the growth of coral , may be inferred with certainty from the following facts . In the deep lagoons of Peros Banhos and of the Great Chagos Bank , there are , as already described , small steep-sided knolls covered with living coral . There are similar knolls in the southern Maldiva atolls , some of which , as Captain Moresby assures me , are less than a hundred yards in diameter , and rise to the surface from a depth of between two hundred and fifty and three hundred feet . Considering their number , form , and position , it would be preposterous to suppose that they are based on pinnacles of any rock , not of coral formation ; or that sediment could have been heaped up into such small and steep isolated cones . As no kind of living coral grows above the height of a few feet , we are compelled to suppose that these knolls have been formed by the successive growth and death of many individuals , -- first one being broken off or killed by some accident , and then another , and one set of species being replaced by another set with different habits , as the reef rose nearer the surface , or as other changes supervened . The spaces between the corals would become filled up with fragments and sand , and such matter would probably soon be consolidated , for we learn from Lieutenant Nelson ( `` Geological Transactions , '' volume v. , page 113 . ) , that at Bermuda a process of this kind takes place beneath water , without the aid of evaporation . In reefs , also , of the barrier class , we may feel sure , as I have shown , that masses of great thickness have been formed by the growth of the coral ; in the case of Vanikoro , judging only from the depth of the moat between the land and the reef , the wall of coral-rock must be at least three hundred feet in vertical thickness . It is unfortunate that the upraised coral-islands in the Pacific have not been examined by a geologist . The cliffs of Elizabeth Island , in the Low Archipelago , are eighty feet high , and appear , from Captain Beechey's description , to consist of a homogeneous coral-rock . From the isolated position of this island , we may safely infer that it is an upraised atoll , and therefore that it has been formed by masses of coral , grown together . Savage Island seems , from the description of the younger Forster ( Forster's '' Voyage round the World with Cook , '' volume ii. , pages 163 , 167 . ) , to have a similar structure , and its shores are about forty feet high : some of the Cook Islands also appear ( Williams 's `` Narrative of Missionary Enterprise , '' page 30 . ) to be similarly composed . Captain Belcher , R.N. , in a letter which Captain Beaufort showed me at the admiralty , speaking of Bow atoll , says , `` I have succeeded in boring forty-five feet through coral-sand , when the auger became jammed by the falling in of the surrounding CREAMY matter . '' On one of the Maldiva atolls , Captain Moresby bored to a depth of twenty-six feet , when his auger also broke : he has had the kindness to give me the matter brought up ; it is perfectly white , and like finely triturated coral-rock . In my description of Keeling atoll , I have given some facts , which show that the reef probably has grown outwards ; and I have found , just within the outer margin , the great mounds of Porites and of Millepora , with their summits lately killed , and their sides subsequently thickened by the growth of the coral : a layer , also , of Nullipora had already coated the dead surface . As the external slope of the reef is the same round the whole of this atoll , and round many other atolls , the angle of inclination must result from an adaption between the growing powers of the coral , and the force of the breakers , and their action on the loose sediment . The reef , therefore , could not increase outwards , without a nearly equal addition to every part of the slope , so that the original inclination might be preserved , and this would require a large amount of sediment , all derived from the wear of corals and shells , to be added to the lower part . Moreover , at Keeling atoll , and probably in many other cases , the different kinds of corals would have to encroach on each other ; thus the Nulliporae can not increase outwards without encroaching on the Porites and Millepora complanata , as is now taking place ; nor these latter without encroaching on the strongly branched Madreporet , the Millepora alcicornis , and some Astraeas ; nor these again without a foundation being formed for them within the requisite depth , by the accumulation of sediment . How slow , then , must be the ordinary lateral or outward growth of such reefs . But off Christmas atoll , where the sea is much more shallow than is usual , we have good reason to believe that , within a period not very remote , the reef has increased considerably in width . The land has the extraordinary breadth of three miles ; it consists of parallel ridges of shells and broken corals , which furnish `` an incontestable proof , '' as observed by Cook ( Cook 's `` Third Voyage , '' book III. , chapter x . ) , `` that the island has been produced by accessions from the sea , and is in a state of increase . '' The land is fronted by a coral-reef , and from the manner in which islets are known to be formed , we may feel confident that the reef was not three miles wide , when the first , or most backward ridge , was thrown up ; and , therefore , we must conclude that the reef has grown outwards during the accumulation of the successive ridges . Here then , a wall of coral-rock of very considerable breadth has been formed by the outward growth of the living margin , within a period during which ridges of shells and corals , lying on the bare surface , have not decayed . There can be little doubt , from the account given by Captain Beechey , that Matilda atoll , in the Low Archipelago , has been converted in the space of thirty-four years , from being , as described by the crew of a wrecked whaling vessel , a `` reef of rocks '' into a lagoon-island , fourteen miles in length , with `` one of its sides covered nearly the whole way with high trees . '' ( Beechey 's `` Voyage to the Pacific , '' chapter vii . and viii . ) The islets , also , on Keeling atoll , it has been shown , have increased in length , and since the construction of an old chart , several of them have become united into one long islet ; but in this case , and in that of Matilda atoll , we have no proof , and can only infer as probable , that the reef , that is the foundation of the islets , has increased as well as the islets themselves . After these considerations , I attach little importance , as indicating the ordinary and still less the possible rate of OUTWARD growth of coral-reefs , to the fact that certain reefs in the Red Sea have not increased during a long interval of time ; or to other such cases , as that of Ouluthy atoll in the Caroline group , where every islet , described a thousand years before by Cantova was found in the same state by Lutke ( F. Lutke 's `` Voyage autour du Monde . '' In the group Elato , however , it appears that what is now the islet Falipi , is called in Cantova 's Chart , the Banc de Falipi . It is not stated whether this has been caused by the growth of coral , or by the accumulation of sand . ) , -- without it could be shown that , in these cases , the conditions were favourable to the vigorous and unopposed growth of the corals living in the different zones of depth , and that a proper basis for the extent of the reef was present . The former conditions must depend on many contingencies , and in the deep oceans where coral formations most abound , a basis within the requisite depth can rarely be present . Nor do I attach any importance to the fact of certain submerged reefs , as those off Tahiti , or those within Diego Garcia not now being nearer the surface than they were many years ago , as an indication of the rate under favourable circumstances of the UPWARD growth of reefs ; after it has been shown , that all the reefs have grown to the surface in some of the Chagos atolls , but that in neighbouring atolls which appear to be of equal antiquity and to be exposed to the same external conditions , every reef remains submerged ; for we are almost driven to attribute this to a difference , not in the rate of growth , but in the habits of the corals in the two cases . In an old-standing reef , the corals , which are so different in kind on different parts of it , are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy , and hold their places , like other organic beings , by a struggle one with another , and with external nature ; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow , except under peculiarly favourable circumstances . Almost the only natural condition , allowing a quick upward growth of the whole surface of a reef , would be a slow subsidence of the area in which it stood ; if , for instance , Keeling atoll were to subside two or three feet , can we doubt that the projecting margin of live coral , about half an inch in thickness , which surrounds the dead upper surfaces of the mounds of Porites , would in this case form a concentric layer over them , and the reef thus increase upwards , instead of , as at present , outwards ? The Nulliporae are now encroaching on the Porites and Millepora , but in this case might we not confidently expect that the latter would , in their turn , encroach on the Nulliporae ? After a subsidence of this kind , the sea would gain on the islets , and the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon , would be covered by a sheet of clear water ; and might we not then expect that these reefs would rise to the surface , as they anciently did when the lagoon was less confined by islets , and as they did within a period of ten years in the schooner-channel , cut by the inhabitants ? In one of the Maldiva atolls , a reef , which within a very few years existed as an islet bearing cocoa-nut trees , was found by Lieutenant Prentice '' ENTIRELY COVERED WITH LIVE CORAL AND MADREPORE . '' The natives believe that the islet was washed away by a change in the currents , but if , instead of this , it had quietly subsided , surely every part of the island which offered a solid foundation , would in a like manner have become coated with living coral . Through steps such as these , any thickness of rock , composed of a singular intermixture of various kinds of corals , shells , and calcareous sediment , might be formed ; but without subsidence , the thickness would necessarily be determined by the depth at which the reef-building polypifers can exist . If it be asked , at what rate in years I suppose a reef of coral favourably circumstanced could grow up from a given depth ; I should answer , that we have no precise evidence on this point , and comparatively little concern with it . We see , in innumerable points over wide areas , that the rate has been sufficient , either to bring up the reefs from various depths to the surface , or , as is more probable , to keep them at the surface , during progressive subsidences ; and this is a much more important standard of comparison than any cycle of years . It may , however , be inferred from the following facts , that the rate in years under favourable circumstances would be very far from slow . Dr. Allan , of Forres , has , in his MS. Thesis deposited in the library of the Edinburgh University ( extracts from which I owe to the kindness of Dr. Malcolmson ) , the following account of some experiments , which he tried during his travels in the years 1830 to 1832 on the east coast of Madagascar . `` To ascertain the rise and progress of the coral-family , and fix the number of species met with at Foul Point ( latitude 17 deg 40 ' ) twenty species of coral were taken off the reef and planted apart on a sand-bank THREE FEET DEEP AT LOW WATER . Each portion weighed ten pounds , and was kept in its place by stakes . Similar quantities were placed in a clump and secured as the rest . This was done in December 1830 . In July following , each detached mass was nearly level with the sea at low water , quite immovable , and several feet long , stretching as the parent reef , with the coast current from north to south . The masses accumulated in a clump were found equally increased , but some of the species in such unequal ratios , as to be growing over each other . '' The loss of Dr. Allan's magnificent collection by shipwreck , unfortunately prevents its being known to what genera these corals belonged ; but from the numbers experimented on , it is certain that all the more conspicuous kinds must have been included . Dr. Allan informs me , in a letter , that he believes it was a Madrepora , which grew most vigorously . One may be permitted to suspect that the level of the sea might possibly have been somewhat different at the two stated periods ; nevertheless , it is quite evident that the growth of the ten-pound masses , during the six or seven months , at the end of which they were found immovably fixed ( It is stated by De la Beche ( `` Geological Manual , '' page 143 ) , on the authority of Mr. Lloyd , who surveyed the Isthmus of Panama , that some specimens of Polypifers , placed by him in a sheltered pool of water , were found in the course of a few days firmly fixed by the secretion of a stony matter , to the bottom ) and several feet in length , must have been very great . The fact of the different kinds of coral , when placed in one clump , having increased in extremely unequal ratios , is very interesting , as it shows the manner in which a reef , supporting many species of coral , would probably be affected by a change in the external conditions favouring one kind more than another . The growth of the masses of coral in N. and S. lines parallel to the prevailing currents , whether due to the drifting of sediment or to the simple movement of the water , is , also , a very interesting circumstance . A fact , communicated to me by Lieutenant Wellstead , I.N. , in some degree corroborates the result of Dr. Allan 's experiments : it is , that in the Persian Gulf a ship had her copper bottom encrusted in the course of twenty months with a layer of coral , TWO FEET in thickness , which it required great force to remove , when the vessel was docked : it was not ascertained to what order this coral belonged . The case of the schooner-channel choked up with coral in an interval of less than ten years , in the lagoon of Keeling atoll , should be here borne in mind . We may also infer , from the trouble which the inhabitants of the Maldiva atolls take to root out , as they express it , the coral-knolls from their harbours , that their growth can hardly be very slow . ( Mr. Stutchbury ( `` West of England Journal '' , No . I. , page 50 . ) has described a specimen of Agaricia , `` weighing 2 lbs . 9 oz. , which surrounds a species of oyster , whose age could not be more than two years , and yet is completely enveloped by this dense coral . '' I presume that the oyster was living when the specimen was procured ; otherwise the fact tells nothing . Mr. Stutchbury also mentions an anchor , which had become entirely encrusted with coral in fifty years ; other cases , however , are recorded of anchors which have long remained amidst coral-reefs without having become coated . The anchor of the `` Beagle '' , in 1832 , after having been down exactly one month at Rio de Janeiro , was so thickly coated by two species of Tubularia , that large spaces of the iron were entirely concealed ; the tufts of this horny zoophyte were between two and three inches in length . It has been attempted to compute , but I believe erroneously , the rate of growth of a reef , from the fact mentioned by Captain Beechey , of the Chama gigas being embedded in coral-rock . But it should be remembered , that some species of this genus invariably live , both whilst young and old , in cavities , which the animal has the power of enlarging with its growth . I saw many of these shells thus embedded in the outer `` flat '' of Keeling atoll , which is composed of dead rock ; and therefore the cavities in this case had no relation whatever with the growth of coral . M. Lesson , also , speaking of this shell ( Partie Zoolog . `` Voyage de la 'Coquille ' '' ) , has remarked , `` que constamment ses valves etaient engages completement dans la masse des Madrepores . '' ) From the facts given in this section , it may be concluded , first , that considerable thicknesses of rock have certainly been formed within the present geological area by the growth of coral and the accumulation of its detritus ; and , secondly , that the increase of individual corals and of reefs , both outwards or horizontally and upwards or vertically , under the peculiar conditions favourable to such increase , is not slow , when referred either to the standard of the average oscillations of level in the earth's crust , or to the more precise but less important one of a cycle of years . SECTION 4.III. -- ON THE DEPTHS AT WHICH REEF-BUILDING POLYPIFERS CAN LIVE . I have already described in detail , which might have appeared trivial , the nature of the bottom of the sea immediately surrounding Keeling atoll ; and I will now describe with almost equal care the soundings off the fringing-reefs of Mauritius . I have preferred this arrangement , for the sake of grouping together facts of a similar nature . I sounded with the wide bell-shaped lead which Captain Fitzroy used at Keeling Island , but my examination of the bottom was confined to a few miles of coast ( between Port Louis and Tomb Bay ) on the leeward side of the island . The edge of the reef is formed of great shapeless masses of branching Madrepores , which chiefly consist of two species , -- apparently M. corymbosa and pocillifera , -- mingled with a few other kinds of coral . These masses are separated from each other by the most irregular gullies and cavities , into which the lead sinks many feet . Outside this irregular border of Madrepores , the water deepens gradually to twenty fathoms , which depth generally is found at the distance of from half to three-quarters of a mile from the reef . A little further out the depth is thirty fathoms , and thence the bank slopes rapidly into the depths of the ocean . This inclination is very gentle compared with that outside Keeling and other atolls , but compared with most coasts it is steep . The water was so clear outside the reef , that I could distinguish every object forming the rugged bottom . In this part , and to a depth of eight fathoms , I sounded repeatedly , and at each cast pounded the bottom with the broad lead , nevertheless the arming invariably came up perfectly clean , but deeply indented . From eight to fifteen fathoms a little calcareous sand was occasionally brought up , but more frequently the arming was simply indented . In all this space the two Madrepores above mentioned , and two species of Astraea , with rather large stars , seemed the commonest kinds ( Since the preceding pages were printed off , I have received from Mr. Lyell a very interesting pamphlet , entitled `` Remarks upon Coral Formations , '' etc. , by J. Couthouy , Boston , United States , 1842 . There is a statement ( page 6 ) , on the authority of the Rev . J. Williams , corroborating the remarks made by Ehrenberg and Lyell ( page 71 of this volume ) , on the antiquity of certain individual corals in the Red Sea and at Bermuda ; namely , that at Upolu , one of the Navigator Islands , '' particular clumps of coral are known to the fishermen by name , derived from either some particular configuration or tradition attached to them , and handed down from time immemorial . '' With respect to the thickness of masses of coral-rock , it clearly appears , from the descriptions given by Mr. Couthouy ( pages 34 , 58 ) that Mangaia and Aurora Islands are upraised atolls , composed of coral rock : the level summit of the former is about three hundred feet , and that of Aurora Island is two hundred feet above the sea-level . ) ; and it must be noticed that twice at the depth of fifteen fathoms , the arming was marked with a clean impression of an Astraea . Besides these lithophytes , some fragments of the Millepora alcicornis , which occurs in the same relative position at Keeling Island , were brought up ; and in the deeper parts there were large beds of a Seriatopora , different from S. subulata , but closely allied to it . On the beach within the reef , the rolled fragments consisted chiefly of the corals just mentioned , and of a massive Porites , like that at Keeling atoll , of a Meandrina , Pocillopora verrucosa , and of numerous fragments of Nullipora . From fifteen to twenty fathoms the bottom was , with few exceptions , either formed of sand , or thickly covered with Seriatopora : this delicate coral seems to form at these depths extensive beds unmingled with any other kind . At twenty fathoms , one sounding brought up a fragment of Madrepora apparently M. pocillifera , and I believe it is the same species ( for I neglected to bring specimens from both stations ) which mainly forms the upper margin of the reef ; if so , it grows in depths varying from 0 to 20 fathoms . Between 20 and 23 fathoms I obtained several soundings , and they all showed a sandy bottom , with one exception at 30 fathoms , when the arming came up scooped out , as if by the margin of a large Caryophyllia . Beyond 33 fathoms I sounded only once ; and from 86 fathoms , at the distance of one mile and a third from the edge of the reef , the arming brought up calcareous sand with a pebble of volcanic rock . The circumstance of the arming having invariably come up quite clean , when sounding within a certain number of fathoms off the reefs of Mauritius and Keeling atoll ( eight fathoms in the former case , and twelve in the latter ) and of its having always come up ( with one exception ) smoothed and covered with sand , when the depth exceeded twenty fathoms , probably indicates a criterion , by which the limits of the vigorous growth of coral might in all cases be readily ascertained . I do not , however , suppose that if a vast number of soundings were obtained round these islands , the limit above assigned would be found never to vary , but I conceive the facts are sufficient to show , that the exceptions would be few . The circumstance of a GRADUAL change , in the two cases , from a field of clean coral to a smooth sandy bottom , is far more important in indicating the depth at which the larger kinds of coral flourish than almost any number of separate observations on the depth , at which certain species have been dredged up . For we can understand the gradation , only as a prolonged struggle against unfavourable conditions . If a person were to find the soil clothed with turf on the banks of a stream of water , but on going to some distance on one side of it , he observed the blades of grass growing thinner and thinner , with intervening patches of sand , until he entered a desert of sand , he would safely conclude , especially if changes of the same kind were noticed in other places , that the presence of the water was absolutely necessary to the formation of a thick bed of turf : so may we conclude , with the same feeling of certainty , that thick beds of coral are formed only at small depths beneath the surface of the sea . I have endeavoured to collect every fact , which might either invalidate or corroborate this conclusion . Captain Moresby , whose opportunities for observation during his survey of the Maldiva and Chagos Archipelagoes have been unrivalled , informs me , that the upper part or zone of the steep-sided reefs , on the inner and outer coasts of the atolls in both groups , invariably consists of coral , and the lower parts of sand . At seven or eight fathoms depth , the bottom is formed , as could be seen through the clear water , of great living masses of coral , which at about ten fathoms generally stand some way apart from each other , with patches of white sand between them , and at a little greater depth these patches become united into a smooth steep slope , without any coral . Captain Moresby , also , informs me in support of his statement , that he found only decayed coral on the Padua Bank ( northern part of the Laccadive group ) which has an average depth between twenty-five and thirty-five fathoms , but that on some other banks in the same group with only ten or twelve fathoms water on them ( for instance , the Tillacapeni bank ) , the coral was living . With regard to the coral-reefs in the Red Sea , Ehrenberg has the following passage : -- '' The living corals do not descend there into great depths . On the edges of islets and near reefs , where the depth was small , very many lived ; but we found no more even at six fathoms . The pearl-fishers at Yemen and Massaua asserted that there was no coral near the pearl-banks at nine fathoms depth , but only sand . We were not able to institute any more special researches . '' ( Ehrenberg , `` Uber die Natur , '' etc. , page 50 . ) I am , however , assured both by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Wellstead , that in the more northern parts of the Red Sea , there are extensive beds of living coral at a depth of twenty-five fathoms , in which the anchors of their vessels were frequently entangled . Captain Moresby attributes the less depth , at which the corals are able to live in the places mentioned by Ehrenberg , to the greater quantity of sediment there ; and the situations , where they were flourishing at the depth of twenty-five fathoms , were protected , and the water was extraordinarily limpid . On the leeward side of Mauritius where I found the coral growing at a somewhat greater depth than at Keeling atoll , the sea , owing apparently to its tranquil state , was likewise very clear . Within the lagoons of some of the Marshall atolls , where the water can be but little agitated , there are , according to Kotzebue , living beds of coral in twenty-five fathoms . From these facts , and considering the manner in which the beds of clean coral off Mauritius , Keeling Island , the Maldiva and Chagos atolls , graduated into a sandy slope , it appears very probable that the depth , at which reef-building polypifers can exist , is partly determined by the extent of inclined surface , which the currents of the sea and the recoiling waves have the power to keep free from sediment . MM . Quoy and Gaimard ( `` Annales des Sci . Nat . '' tom . vi . ) believe that the growth of coral is confined within very limited depths ; and they state that they never found any fragment of an Astraea ( the genus they consider most efficient in forming reefs ) at a depth above twenty-five or thirty feet . But we have seen that in several places the bottom of the sea is paved with massive corals at more than twice this depth ; and at fifteen fathoms ( or twice this depth ) off the reefs of Mauritius , the arming was marked with the distinct impression of a living Astraea . Millepora alcicornis lives in from 0 to 12 fathoms , and the genera Madrepora and Seriatopora from 0 to 20 fathoms . Captain Moresby has given me a specimen of Sideropora scabra ( Porites of Lamarck ) brought up alive from 17 fathoms . Mr. Couthouy ( `` Remarks on Coral Formations , '' page 12 . ) states that he has dredged up on the Bahama banks considerable masses of Meandrina from 16 fathoms , and he has seen this coral growing in 20 fathoms . A Caryophyllia , half an inch in diameter , was dredged up alive from 80 fathoms off Juan Fernandez ( latitude 33 deg S. ) by Captain P.P . King ( I am indebted to Mr. Stokes for having kindly communicated this fact to me , together with much other valuable information . ) : this is the most remarkable fact with which I am acquainted , showing the depth at which a genus of corals often found on reefs , can exist . We ought , however , to feel less surprise at this fact , as Caryophyllia alone of the lamelliform genera , ranges far beyond the tropics ; it is found in Zetland ( Fleming 's `` British Animals , '' genus Caryophyllia . ) in Latitude 60 deg N. in deep water , and I procured a small species from Tierra del Fuego in Latitude 53 deg S. Captain Beechey informs me , that branches of pink and yellow coral were frequently brought up from between twenty and twenty-five fathoms off the Low atolls ; and Lieutenant Stokes , writing to me from the N.W . coast of Australia , says that a strongly branched coral was procured there from thirty fathoms ; unfortunately it is not known to what genera these corals belong . ( I will record in the form of a note all the facts that I have been able to collect on the depths , both within and without the tropics , at which those corals and corallines can live , which there is no reason to suppose ever materially aid in the construction of a reef .

Hist . of Coralline , '' page 96 ) states that Ombellularia was procured in latitude 79 deg N. STICKING to a LINE from the depth of 236 fathoms ; hence this coral either must have been floating loose , or was entangled in stray line at the bottom . Off Keeling atoll a compound Ascidia ( Sigillina ) was brought up from 39 fathoms , and a piece of sponge , apparently living , from 70 , and a fragment of Nullipora also apparently living from 92 fathoms . At a greater depth than 90 fathoms off this coral island , the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of Halimeda and small fragments of other Nulliporae , but all dead . Captain B. Allen , R.N. , informs me that in the survey of the West Indies it was noticed that between the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms , the sounding lead very generally came up coated with the dead joints of a Halimeda , of which he showed me specimens . Off Pernambuco , in Brazil , in about twelve fathoms , the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a dull red Nullipora , and I infer from Roussin 's chart , that a bottom of this kind extends over a wide area . On the beach , within the coral-reefs of Mauritius , vast quantities of fragments of Nulliporae were piled up . From these facts it appears , that these simply organized bodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea . ) Although the limit of depth , at which each particular kind of coral ceases to exist , is far from being accurately known ; yet when we bear in mind the manner in which the clumps of coral gradually became infrequent at about the same depth , and wholly disappeared at a greater depth than twenty fathoms , on the slope round Keeling atoll , on the leeward side of the Mauritius , and at rather less depth , both without and within the atolls of the Maldiva and Chagos Archipelagoes ; and when we know that the reefs round these islands do not differ from other coral formations in their form and structure , we may , I think , conclude that in ordinary cases , reef-building polypifers do not flourish at greater depths than between twenty and thirty fathoms . It has been argued ( `` Journal of the Royal Geographical Society , '' 1831 , page 218 . ) that reefs may possibly rise from very great depths through the means of small corals , first making a platform for the growth of the stronger kinds . This , however , is an arbitrary supposition : it is not always remembered , that in such cases there is an antagonist power in action , namely , the decay of organic bodies , when not protected by a covering of sediment , or by their own rapid growth . We have , moreover , no right to calculate on unlimited time for the accumulation of small organic bodies into great masses . Every fact in geology proclaims that neither the land , nor the bed of the sea retain for indefinite periods the same level . As well might it be imagined that the British Seas would in time become choked up with beds of oysters , or that the numerous small corallines off the inhospitable shores of Tierra del Fuego would in time form a solid and extensive coral-reef . CHAPTER V. -- THEORY OF THE FORMATION OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CORAL-REEFS . The atolls of the larger archipelagoes are not formed on submerged craters , or on banks of sediment. -- Immense areas interspersed with atolls. -- Their subsidence. -- The effects of storms and earthquakes on atolls. -- Recent changes in their state. -- The origin of barrier-reefs and of atolls. -- Their relative forms. -- The step-formed ledges and walls round the shores of some lagoons. -- The ring-formed reefs of the Maldiva atolls. -- The submerged condition of parts or of the whole of some annular reefs. -- The disseverment of large atolls. -- The union of atolls by linear reefs. -- The Great Chagos Bank. -- Objections from the area and amount of subsidence required by the theory , considered. -- The probable composition of the lower parts of atolls . The naturalists who have visited the Pacific , seem to have had their attention riveted by the lagoon-islands , or atolls , -- those singular rings of coral-land which rise abruptly out of the unfathomable ocean -- and have passed over , almost unnoticed , the scarcely less wonderful encircling barrier-reefs . The theory most generally received on the formation of atolls , is that they are based on submarine craters ; but where can we find a crater of the shape of Bow atoll , which is five times as long as it is broad ( Plate I. , Figure 4 ) ; or like that of Menchikoff Island ( Plate II. , Figure 3 . ) , with its three loops , together sixty miles in length ; or like Rimsky Korsacoff , narrow , crooked , and fifty-four miles long ; or like the northern Maldiva atolls , made up of numerous ring-formed reefs , placed on the margin of a disc , -- one of which discs is eighty-eight miles in length , and only from ten to twenty in breadth ? It is , also , not a little improbable , that there should have existed as many craters of immense size crowded together beneath the sea , as there are now in some parts atolls . But this theory lies under a greater difficulty , as will be evident , when we consider on what foundations the atolls of the larger archipelagoes rest : nevertheless , if the rim of a crater afforded a basis at the proper depth , I am far from denying that a reef like a perfectly characterised atoll might not be formed ; some such , perhaps , now exist ; but I can not believe in the possibility of the greater number having thus originated . An earlier and better theory was proposed by Chamisso ( Kotzebue 's `` First Voyage , '' volume iii. , page 331 . ) ; he supposes that as the more massive kinds of corals prefer the surf , the outer portions , in a reef rising from a submarine basis , would first reach the surface and consequently form a ring . But on this view it must be assumed , that in every case the basis consists of a flat bank ; for if it were conically formed , like a mountainous mass , we can see no reason why the coral should spring up from the flanks , instead of from the central and highest parts : considering the number of the atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans , this assumption is very improbable . As the lagoons of atolls are sometimes even more than forty fathoms deep , it must , also , be assumed on this view , that at a depth at which the waves do not break , the coral grows more vigorously on the edges of a bank than on its central part ; and this is an assumption without any evidence in support of it . I remarked , in the third chapter , that a reef , growing on a detached bank , would tend to assume an atoll-like structure ; if , therefore , corals were to grow up from a bank , with a level surface some fathoms submerged , having steep sides and being situated in a deep sea , a reef not to be distinguished from an atoll , might be formed : I believe some such exist in the West Indies . But a difficulty of the same kind with that affecting the crater theory , runners , as we shall presently see , this view inapplicable to the greater number of atolls . No theory worthy of notice has been advanced to account for those barrier-reefs , which encircle islands of moderate dimensions . The great reef which fronts the coast of Australia has been supposed , but without any special facts , to rest on the edge of a submarine precipice , extending parallel to the shore . The origin of the third class or of fringing-reefs presents , I believe , scarcely any difficulty , and is simply consequent on the polypifers not growing up from great depths , and their not flourishing close to gently shelving beaches where the water is often turbid . What cause , then , has given to atolls and barrier-reefs their characteristic forms ? Let us see whether an important deduction will not follow from the consideration of these two circumstances , first , the reef-building corals flourishing only at limited depths ; and secondly , the vastness of the areas interspersed with coral-reefs and coral-islets , none of which rise to a greater height above the level of the sea , than that attained by matter thrown up by the waves and winds . I do not make this latter statement vaguely ; I have carefully sought for descriptions of every island in the intertropical seas ; and my task has been in some degree abridged by a map of the Pacific , corrected in 1834 by MM . D'Urville and Lottin , in which the low islands are distinguished from the high ones ( even from those much less than a hundred feet in height ) by being written without a capital letter ; I have detected a few errors in this map , respecting the height of some of the islands , which will be noticed in the Appendix , where I treat of coral formations in geographical order . To the Appendix , also , I must refer for a more particular account of the data on which the statements on the next page are grounded . I have ascertained , and chiefly from the writings of Cook , Kotzebue , Bellinghausen , Duperrey , Beechey , and Lutke , regarding the Pacific ; and from Moresby ( See also Captain Owen 's and Lieutenant Wood 's papers in the `` Geographical Journal '' , on the Maldiva and Laccadive Archipelagoes . These officers particularly refer to the lowness of the islets ; but I chiefly ground my assertion respecting these two groups , and the Chagos group , from information communicated to me by Captain Moresby . ) with respect to the Indian Ocean , that in the following cases the term `` low island '' strictly means land of the height commonly attained by matter thrown up by the winds and the waves of an open sea . If we draw a line ( the plan I have always adopted ) joining the external atolls of that part of the Low Archipelago in which the islands are numerous , the figure will be a pointed ellipse ( reaching from Hood to Lazaref Island ) , of which the longer axis is 840 geographical miles , and the shorter 420 miles ; in this space ( I find from Mr. Couthouy's pamphlet ( page 58 ) that Aurora Island is about two hundred feet in height ; it consists of coral-rock , and seems to have been formed by the elevation of an atoll . It lies north-east of Tahiti , close without the line bounding the space coloured dark blue in the map appended to this volume . Honden Island , which is situated in the extreme north-west part of the Low Archipelago , according to measurements made on board the `` Beagle '' , whilst sailing by , is 114 feet from the SUMMIT OF THE TREES to the water 's edge . This island appeared to resemble the other atolls of the group . ) none of the innumerable islets united into great rings rise above the stated level . The Gilbert group is very narrow , and 300 miles in length . In a prolonged line from this group , at the distance of 240 miles , is the Marshall Archipelago , the figure of which is an irregular square , one end being broader than the other ; its length is 520 miles , with an average width of 240 ; these two groups together are 1,040 miles in length , and all their islets are low . Between the southern end of the Gilbert and the northern end of Low Archipelago , the ocean is thinly strewed with islands , all of which , as far as I have been able to ascertain , are low ; so that from nearly the southern end of the Low Archipelago , to the northern end of the Marshall Archipelago , there is a narrow band of ocean , more than 4,000 miles in length , containing a great number of islands , all of which are low . In the western part of the Caroline Archipelago , there is a space of 480 miles in length , and about 100 broad , thinly interspersed with low islands . Lastly , in the Indian Ocean , the archipelago of the Maldivas is 470 miles in length , and 60 in breadth ; that of the Laccadives is 150 by 100 miles ; as there is a low island between these two groups , they may be considered as one group of 1,000 miles in length . To this may be added the Chagos group of low islands , situated 280 miles distant , in a line prolonged from the southern extremity of the Maldivas . This group , including the submerged banks , is 170 miles in length and 80 in breadth . So striking is the uniformity in direction of these three archipelagoes , all the islands of which are low , that Captain Moresby , in one of his papers , speaks of them as parts of one great chain , nearly 1,500 miles long . I am , then , fully justified in repeating , that enormous spaces , both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans , are interspersed with islands , of which not one rises above that height , to which the waves and winds in an open sea can heap up matter . On what foundations , then , have these reefs and islets of coral been constructed ? A foundation must originally have been present beneath each atoll at that limited depth , which is indispensable for the first growth of the reef-building polypifers . A conjecture will perhaps be hazarded , that the requisite bases might have been afforded by the accumulation of great banks of sediment , which owing to the action of superficial currents ( aided possibly by the undulatory movement of the sea ) did not quite reach the surface , -- as actually appears to have been the case in some parts of the West Indian Sea . But in the form and disposition of the groups of atolls , there is nothing to countenance this notion ; and the assumption without any proof , that a number of immense piles of sediment have been heaped on the floor of the great Pacific and Indian Oceans , in their central parts far remote from land , and where the dark blue colour of the limpid water bespeaks its purity , can not for one moment be admitted . The many widely-scattered atolls must , therefore , rest on rocky bases . But we can not believe that the broad summit of a mountain lies buried at the depth of a few fathoms beneath every atoll , and nevertheless throughout the immense areas above-named , with not one point of rock projecting above the level of the sea ; for we may judge with some accuracy of mountains beneath the sea , by those on the land ; and where can we find a single chain several hundred miles in length and of considerable breadth , much less several such chains , with their many broad summits attaining the same height , within from 120 to 180 feet ? If the data be thought insufficient , on which I have grounded my belief , respecting the depth at which the reef-building polypifers can exist , and it be assumed that they can flourish at a depth of even one hundred fathoms , yet the weight of the above argument is but little diminished , for it is almost equally improbable , that as many submarine mountains , as there are low islands in the several great and widely separated areas above specified , should all rise within six hundred feet of the surface of the sea and not one above it , as that they should be of the same height within the smaller limit of one or two hundred feet . So highly improbable is this supposition , that we are compelled to believe , that the bases of the many atolls did never at any one period all lie submerged within the depth of a few fathoms beneath the surface , but that they were brought into the requisite position or level , some at one period and some at another , through movements in the earth 's crust . But this could not have been effected by elevation , for the belief that points so numerous and so widely separated were successively uplifted to a certain level , but that not one point was raised above that level , is quite as improbable as the former supposition , and indeed differs little from it . It will probably occur to those who have read Ehrenberg 's account of the Reefs of the Red Sea , that many points in these great areas may have been elevated , but that as soon as raised , the protuberant parts were cut off by the destroying action of the waves : a moment 's reflection , however , on the basin-like form of the atolls , will show that this is impossible ; for the upheaval and subsequent abrasion of an island would leave a flat disc , which might become coated with coral , but not a deeply concave surface ; moreover , we should expect to see , in some parts at least , the rock of the foundation brought to the surface . If , then , the foundations of the many atolls were not uplifted into the requisite position , they must of necessity have subsided into it ; and this at once solves every difficulty ( The additional difficulty on the crater hypothesis before alluded to , will now be evident ; for on this view the volcanic action must be supposed to have formed within the areas specified a vast number of craters , all rising within a few fathoms of the surface , and not one above it . The supposition that the craters were at different times upraised above the surface , and were there abraded by the surf and subsequently coated by corals , is subject to nearly the same objections with those given above in this paragraph ; but I consider it superfluous to detail all the arguments opposed to such a notion . Chamisso 's theory , from assuming the existence of so many banks , all lying at the proper depth beneath the water , is also vitally defective . The same observation applies to an hypothesis of Lieutenant Nelson 's ( `` Geolog . Trans . '' volume v. , page 122 ) , who supposes that the ring-formed structure is caused by a greater number of germs of corals becoming attached to the declivity , than to the central plateau of a submarine bank : it likewise applies to the notion formerly entertained ( Forster 's `` Observ . '' page 151 ) , that lagoon-islands owe their peculiar form to the instinctive tendencies of the polypifers . According to this latter view , the corals on the outer margin of the reef instinctively expose themselves to the surf in order to afford protection to corals living in the lagoon , which belong to other genera , and to other families ! ) , for we may safely infer , from the facts given in the last chapter , that during a gradual subsidence the corals would be favourably circumstanced for building up their solid frame works and reaching the surface , as island after island slowly disappeared . Thus areas of immense extent in the central and most profound parts of the great oceans , might become interspersed with coral-islets , none of which would rise to a greater height than that attained by detritus heaped up by the sea , and nevertheless they might all have been formed by corals , which absolutely required for their growth a solid foundation within a few fathoms of the surface . It would be out of place here to do more than allude to the many facts , showing that the supposition of a gradual subsidence over large areas is by no means improbable . We have the clearest proof that a movement of this kind is possible , in the upright trees buried under the strata many thousand feet in thickness ; we have also every reason for believing that there are now large areas gradually sinking , in the same manner as others are rising . And when we consider how many parts of the surface of the globe have been elevated within recent geological periods , we must admit that there have been subsidences on a corresponding scale , for otherwise the whole globe would have swollen . It is very remarkable that Mr. Lyell ( `` Principles of Geology , '' sixth edition , volume iii. , page 386 . ) , even in the first edition of his `` Principles of Geology , '' inferred that the amount of subsidence in the Pacific must have exceeded that of elevation , from the area of land being very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it , namely , the growth of coral and volcanic action . But it will be asked , are there any direct proofs of a subsiding movement in those areas , in which subsidence will explain a phenomenon otherwise inexplicable ? This , however , can hardly be expected , for it must ever be most difficult , excepting in countries long civilised , to detect a movement , the tendency of which is to conceal the part affected . In barbarous and semi-civilised nations how long might not a slow movement , even of elevation such as that now affecting Scandinavia , have escaped attention ! Mr. Williams ( Williams 's `` Narrative of Missionary Enterprise , '' page 31 . ) insists strongly that the traditions of the natives , which he has taken much pains in collecting , do not indicate the appearance of any new islands : but on the theory of a gradual subsidence , all that would be apparent would be , the water sometimes encroaching slowly on the land , and the land again recovering by the accumulation of detritus its former extent , and perhaps sometimes the conversion of an atoll with coral islets on it , into a bare or into a sunken annular reef . Such changes would naturally take place at the periods when the sea rose above its usual limits , during a gale of more than ordinary strength ; and the effects of the two causes would be hardly distinguishable . In Kotzebue 's `` Voyage '' there are accounts of islands , both in the Caroline and Marshall Archipelagoes , which have been partly washed away during hurricanes ; and Kadu , the native who was on board one of the Russian vessels , said `` he saw the sea at Radack rise to the feet of the cocoa-nut trees ; but it was conjured in time . '' ( Kotzebue 's `` First Voyage , '' volume iii. , page 168 . ) A storm lately entirely swept away two of the Caroline islands , and converted them into shoals ; it partly , also , destroyed two other islands . ( M. Desmoulins in `` Comptes Rendus , '' 1840 , page 837 . ) According to a tradition which was communicated to Captain Fitzroy , it is believed in the Low Archipelago , that the arrival of the first ship caused a great inundation , which destroyed many lives . Mr. Stutchbury relates , that in 1825 , the western side of Chain Atoll , in the same group , was completely devastated by a hurricane , and not less than 300 lives lost : `` in this instance it was evident , even to the natives , that the hurricane alone was not sufficient to account for the violent agitation of the ocean . '' ( `` West of England Journal '' , No . I. , page 35 . ) That considerable changes have taken place recently in some of the atolls in the Low Archipelago , appears certain from the case already given of Matilda Island : with respect to Whitsunday and Gloucester Islands in this same group , we must either attribute great inaccuracy to their discoverer , the famous circumnavigator Wallis , or believe that they have undergone a considerable change in the period of fifty-nine years , between his voyage and that of Captain Beechey 's . Whitsunday Island is described by Wallis as `` about four miles long , and three wide , '' now it is only one mile and a half long . The appearance of Gloucester Island , in Captain Beechey 's words ( Beechey 's `` Voyage to the Pacific , '' chapter vii. , and Wallis 's `` Voyage in the 'Dolphin ' , '' chapter iv . ) , has been accurately described by its discoverer , but its present form and extent differ materially . '' Blenheim reef , in the Chagos group , consists of a water-washed annular reef , thirteen miles in circumference , surrounding a lagoon ten fathoms deep : on its surface there were a few worn patches of conglomerate coral-rock , of about the size of hovels ; and these Captain Moresby considered as being , without doubt , the last remnants of islets ; so that here an atoll has been converted into an atoll-formed reef . The inhabitants of the Maldiva Archipelago , as long ago as 1605 , declared , `` that the high tides and violent currents were diminishing the number of the islands '' ( See an extract from Pyrard 's Voyage in Captain Owen 's paper on the Maldiva Archipelago , in the `` Geographical Journal '' , volume ii. , page 84 . ) : and I have already shown , on the authority of Captain Moresby , that the work of destruction is still in progress ; but that on the other hand the first formation of some islets is known to the present inhabitants . In such cases , it would be exceedingly difficult to detect a gradual subsidence of the foundation , on which these mutable structures rest . Some of the archipelagoes of low coral-islands are subject to earthquakes : Captain Moresby informs me that they are frequent , though not very strong , in the Chagos group , which occupies a very central position in the Indian Ocean , and is far from any land not of coral formation . One of the islands in this group was formerly covered by a bed of mould , which , after an earthquake , disappeared , and was believed by the residents to have been washed by the rain through the broken masses of underlying rock ; the island was thus rendered unproductive . Chamisso ( See Chamisso , in Kotzebue's '' First Voyage , '' volume iii. , pages 182 and 136 . ) states , that earthquakes are felt in the Marshall atolls , which are far from any high land , and likewise in the islands of the Caroline Archipelago . On one of the latter , namely Oulleay atoll , Admiral Lutke , as he had the kindness to inform me , observed several straight fissures about a foot in width , running for some hundred yards obliquely across the whole width of the reef . Fissures indicate a stretching of the earth 's crust , and , therefore , probably changes in its level ; but these coral-islands , which have been shaken and fissured , certainly have not been elevated , and , therefore , probably they have subsided . In the chapter on Keeling atoll , I attempted to show by direct evidence , that the island underwent a movement of subsidence , during the earthquakes lately felt there . The facts stand thus ; -- there are many large tracts of ocean , without any high land , interspersed with reefs and islets , formed by the growth of those kinds of corals , which can not live at great depths ; and the existence of these reefs and low islets , in such numbers and at such distant points , is quite inexplicable , excepting on the theory , that the bases on which the reefs first became attached , slowly and successively sank beneath the level of the sea , whilst the corals continued to grow upwards . No positive facts are opposed to this view , and some general considerations render it probable . There is evidence of change in form , whether or not from subsidence , on some of these coral-islands ; and there is evidence of subterranean disturbances beneath them . Will then the theory , to which we have thus been led , solve the curious problem , -- what has given to each class of reef its peculiar form ? ( PLATE : WOODCUT NO . 4 .

According to the scale , the depth of the lagoon and of the lagoon-channel is exaggerated . ) Let us in imagination place within one of the subsiding areas , an island surrounded by a `` fringing-reef , '' -- that kind , which alone offers no difficulty in the explanation of its origin . Let the unbroken lines and the oblique shading in the woodcut ( No . 4 ) represent a vertical section through such an island ; and the horizontal shading will represent the section of the reef . Now , as the island sinks down , either a few feet at a time or quite insensibly , we may safely infer from what we know of the conditions favourable to the growth of coral , that the living masses bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef , will soon regain the surface . The water , however , will encroach , little by little , on the shore , the island becoming lower and smaller , and the space between the edge of the reef and the beach proportionately broader . A section of the reef and island in this state , after a subsidence of several hundred feet , is given by the dotted lines : coral-islets are supposed to have been formed on the new reef , and a ship is anchored in the lagoon-channel . This section is in every respect that of an encircling barrier-reef ; it is , in fact , a section taken ( The section has been made from the chart given in the `` Atlas of the Voyage of the 'Coquille ' . '' The scale is .57 of an inch to a mile . The height of the island , according to M. Lesson , is 4,026 feet . The deepest part of the lagoon-channel is 162 feet ; its depth is exaggerated in the woodcut for the sake of clearness . ) east and west through the highest point of the encircled island of Bolabola ; of which a plan is given in Plate I. , Figure 5 . The same section is more clearly shown in the following woodcut ( No . 5 ) by the unbroken lines . The width of the reef , and its slope , both on the outer and inner side , will have been determined by the growing powers of the coral , under the conditions ( for instance the force of the breakers and of the currents ) to which it has been exposed ; and the lagoon-channel will be deeper or shallower , in proportion to the growth of the delicately branched corals within the reef , and to the accumulation of sediment , relatively , also , to the rate of subsidence and the length of the intervening stationary periods . It is evident in this section , that a line drawn perpendicularly down from the outer edge of the new reef to the foundation of solid rock , exceeds by as many feet as there have been feet of subsidence , that small limit of depth at which the effective polypifers can live -- the corals having grown up , as the whole sank down , from a basis formed of other corals and their consolidated fragments . Thus the difficulty on this head , which before seemed so great , disappears . As the space between the reef and the subsiding shore continued to increase in breadth and depth , and as the injurious effects of the sediment and fresh water borne down from the land were consequently lessened , the greater number of the channels , with which the reef in its fringing state must have been breached , especially those which fronted the smaller streams , will have become choked up with the growth of coral : on the windward side of the reef , where the coral grows most vigorously , the breaches will probably have first been closed . In barrier-reefs , therefore , the breaches kept open by draining the tidal waters of the lagoon-channel , will generally be placed on the leeward side , and they will still face the mouths of the larger streams , although removed beyond the influence of their sediment and fresh water ; -- and this , it has been shown , is commonly the case . Referring to the diagram shown above , in which the newly formed barrier-reef is represented by unbroken lines , instead of by dots as in the former woodcut , let the work of subsidence go on , and the doubly pointed hill will form two small islands ( or more , according to the number of the hills ) included within one annular reef . Let the island continue subsiding , and the coral-reef will continue growing up on its own foundation , whilst the water gains inch by inch on the land , until the last and highest pinnacle is covered , and there remains a perfect atoll . A vertical section of this atoll is shown in the woodcut by the dotted lines ; -- a ship is anchored in its lagoon , but islets are not supposed yet to have been formed on the reef . The depth of the lagoon and the width and slope of the reef , will depend on the circumstances just referred to under barrier-reefs . Any further subsidence will produce no change in the atoll , except perhaps a diminution in its size , from the reef not growing vertically upwards ; but should the currents of the sea act violently upon it , and should the corals perish on part or on the whole of its margin , changes would result during subsidence which will be presently noticed . I may here observe , that a bank either of rock or of hardened sediment , level with the surface of the sea , and fringed with living coral , would ( if not so small as to allow the central space to be quickly filled up with detritus ) by subsidence be converted immediately into an atoll , without passing , as in the case of a reef fringing the shore of an island , through the intermediate form of a barrier-reef . If such a bank lay a few fathoms submerged , the simple growth of the coral ( as remarked in the third chapter ) without the aid of subsidence , would produce a structure scarcely to be distinguished from a true atoll ; for in all cases the corals on the outer margin of a reef , from having space and being freely exposed to the open sea , will grow vigorously and tend to form a continuous ring whilst the growth of the less massive kinds on the central expanse , will be checked by the sediment formed there , and by that washed inwards by the breakers ; and as the space becomes shallower , their growth will , also , be checked by the impurities of the water , and probably by the small amount of food brought by the enfeebled currents , in proportion to the surface of living reefs studded with innumerable craving mouths : the subsidence of a reef based on a bank of this kind , would give depth to its central expanse or lagoon , steepness to its flanks , and through the free growth of the coral , symmetry to its outline : -- I may here repeat that the larger groups of atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans can not be supposed to be founded on banks of this nature . If , instead of the island in the diagram , the shore of a continent fringed by a reef had subsided , a great barrier-reef , like that on the north-east coast of Australia , would have necessarily resulted ; and it would have been separated from the main land by a deep-water channel , broad in proportion to the amount of subsidence , and to the less or greater inclination of the neighbouring coast-line . The effect of the continued subsidence of a great barrier-reef of this kind , and its probable conversion into a chain of separate atolls , will be noticed , when we discuss the apparent progressive disseverment of the larger Maldiva atolls . We now are able to perceive that the close similarity in form , dimensions , structure , and relative position ( which latter point will hereafter be more fully noticed ) between fringing and encircling barrier-reefs , and between these latter and atolls , is the necessary result of the transformation , during subsidence of the one class into the other . On this view , the three classes of reefs ought to graduate into each other . Reefs having intermediate character between those of the fringing and barrier classes do exist ; for instance , on the south-west coast of Madagascar , a reef extends for several miles , within which there is a broad channel from seven to eight fathoms deep , but the sea does not deepen abruptly outside the reef . Such cases , however , are open to some doubts , for an old fringing-reef , which had extended itself a little on a basis of its own formation , would hardly be distinguishable from a barrier-reef , produced by a small amount of subsidence , and with its lagoon-channel nearly filled up with sediment during a long stationary period . Between barrier-reefs , encircling either one lofty island or several small low ones , and atolls including a mere expanse of water , a striking series can be shown : in proof of this , I need only refer to the first plate in this volume , which speaks more plainly to the eye , than any description could to the ear . The authorities from which the charts have been engraved , together with some remarks on them and descriptive of the plates , are given above . At New Caledonia ( Plate II. , Figure 5 . ) the barrier-reefs extend for 150 miles on each side of the submarine prolongation of the island ; and at their northern extremity they appear broken up and converted into a vast atoll-formed reef , supporting a few low coral-islets : we may imagine that we here see the effects of subsidence actually in progress , the water always encroaching on the northern end of the island , towards which the mountains slope down , and the reefs steadily building up their massive fabrics in the lines of their ancient growth . We have as yet only considered the origin of barrier-reefs and atolls in their simplest form ; but there remain some peculiarities in structure and some special cases , described in the two first chapters , to be accounted for by our theory . These consist -- in the inclined ledge terminated by a wall , and sometimes succeeded by a second ledge with a wall , round the shores of certain lagoons and lagoon-channels ; a structure which can not , as I endeavoured to show , be explained by the simple growing powers of the corals , -- in the ring or basin-like forms of the central reefs , as well as of the separate marginal portions of the northern Maldiva atolls , -- in the submerged condition of the whole , or of parts of certain barrier and atoll-formed reefs ; where only a part is submerged , this being generally to leeward , -- in the apparent progressive disseverment of some of the Maldiva atolls , -- in the existence of irregularly formed atolls , some being tied together by linear reefs , and others with spurs projecting from them , -- and , lastly , in the structure and origin of the Great Chagos Bank . STEP-FORMED LEDGES ROUND CERTAIN LAGOONS . If we suppose an atoll to subside at an extremely slow rate , it is difficult to follow out the complex results . The living corals would grow up on the outer margin ; and likewise probably in the gullies and deeper parts of the bare surface of the annular reef ; the water would encroach on the islets , but the accumulation of fresh detritus might possibly prevent their entire submergence . After a subsidence of this very slow nature , the surface of the annular reef sloping gently into the lagoon , would probably become united with the irregular reefs and banks of sand , which line the shores of most lagoons . Should , however , the atoll be carried down by a more rapid movement , the whole surface of the annular reef , where there was a foundation of solid matter , would be favourably circumstanced for the fresh growth of coral ; but as the corals grew upwards on its exterior margin , and the waves broke heavily on this part , the increase of the massive polypifers on the inner side would be checked from the want of water . Consequently , the exterior parts would first reach the surface , and the new annular reef thus formed on the old one , would have its summit inclined inwards , and be terminated by a subaqueous wall , formed by the upward growth of the coral ( before being much checked ) , from the inner edge of the solid parts of the old reef . The inner portion of the new reef , from not having grown to the surface , would be covered by the waters of the lagoon . Should a subsidence of the same kind be repeated , the corals would again grow up in a wall , from all the solid parts of the resunken reef , and , therefore , not from within the sandy shores of the lagoon ; and the inner part of the new annular reef would , from being as before checked in its upward growth , be of less height than the exterior parts , and therefore would not reach the surface of the lagoon . In this case the shores of the lagoon would be surrounded by two inclined ledges , one beneath the other , and both abruptly terminated by subaqueous cliffs . ( According to Mr. Couthouy ( page 26 ) the external reef round many atolls descends by a succession of ledges or terraces . He attempts , I doubt whether successfully , to explain this structure somewhat in the same manner as I have attempted , with respect to the internal ledges round the lagoons of some atolls . More facts are wanted regarding the nature both of the interior and exterior step-like ledges : are all the ledges , or only the upper ones , covered with living coral ? If they are all covered , are the kinds different on the ledges according to the depth ? Do the interior and exterior ledges occur together in the same atolls ; if so , what is their total width , and is the intervening surface-reef narrow , etc. ? ) THE RING OR BASIN-FORMED REEFS OF THE NORTHERN MALDIVA ATOLLS . I may first observe , that the reefs within the lagoons of atolls and within lagoon-channels , would , if favourably circumstanced , grow upwards during subsidence in the same manner as the annular rim ; and , therefore , we might expect that such lagoon-reefs , when not surrounded and buried by an accumulation of sediment more rapid than the rate of subsidence , would rise abruptly from a greater depth than that at which the efficient polypifers can flourish : we see this well exemplified in the small abruptly-sided reefs , with which the deep lagoons of the Chagos and Southern Maldiva atolls are studded . With respect to the ring or basin-formed reefs of the Northern Maldiva atolls , it is evident , from the perfectly continuous series which exists that the marginal rings , although wider than the exterior or bounding reef of ordinary atolls , are only modified portions of such a reef ; it is also evident that the central rings , although wider than the knolls or reefs which commonly occur in lagoons , occupy their place . The ring-like structure has been shown to be contingent on the breaches into the lagoon being broad and numerous , so that all the reefs which are bathed by the waters of the lagoon are placed under nearly the same conditions with the outer coast of an atoll standing in the open sea . Hence the exterior and living margins of these reefs must have been favourably circumstanced for growing outwards , and increasing beyond the usual breadth ; and they must likewise have been favourably circumstanced for growing vigorously upwards , during the subsiding movements , to which by our theory the whole archipelago has been subjected ; and subsidence with this upward growth of the margins would convert the central space of each little reef into a small lagoon . This , however , could only take place with those reefs , which had increased to a breadth sufficient to prevent their central spaces from being almost immediately filled up with the sand and detritus driven inwards from all sides : hence it is that few reefs , which are less than half a mile in diameter , even in the atolls where the basin-like structure is most strikingly exhibited , include lagoons . This remark , I may add , applies to all coral-reefs wherever found . The basin-formed reefs of the Maldiva Archipelago may , in fact , be briefly described , as small atolls formed during subsidence over the separate portions of large and broken atolls , in the same manner as these latter were formed over the barrier-reefs , which encircled the islands of a large archipelago now wholly submerged . SUBMERGED AND DEAD REEFS . In the second section of the first chapter , I have shown that there are in the neighbourhood of atolls , some deeply submerged banks , with level surfaces ; that there are others , less deeply but yet wholly submerged , having all the characters of perfect atolls , but consisting merely of dead coral-rock ; that there are barrier-reefs and atolls with merely a portion of their reef , generally on the leeward side , submerged ; and that such portions either retain their perfect outline , or they appear to be quite effaced , their former place being marked only by a bank , conforming in outline with that part of the reef which remains perfect . These several cases are , I believe , intimately related together , and can be explained by the same means . There , perhaps , exist some submerged reefs , covered with living coral and growing upwards , but to these I do not here refer . As we see that in those parts of the ocean , where coral-reefs are most abundant , one island is fringed and another neighbouring one is not fringed ; as we see in the same archipelago , that all the reefs are more perfect in one part of it than in another , for instance , in the southern half compared with the northern half of the Maldiva Archipelago , and likewise on the outer coasts compared with the inner coasts of the atolls in this same group , which are placed in a double row ; as we know that the existence of the innumerable polypifers forming a reef , depends on their sustenance , and that they are preyed on by other organic beings ; and , lastly , as we know that some inorganic causes are highly injurious to the growth of coral , it can not be expected that during the round of change to which earth , air , and water are exposed , the reef-building polypifers should keep alive for perpetuity in any one place ; and still less can this be expected , during the progressive subsidences , perhaps at some periods more rapid than at others , to which by our theory these reefs and islands have been subjected and are liable . It is , then , not improbable that the corals should sometimes perish either on the whole or on part of a reef ; if on part , the dead portion , after a small amount of subsidence , would still retain its proper outline and position beneath the water . After a more prolonged subsidence , it would probably form , owing to the accumulation of sediment , only the margin of a flat bank , marking the limits of the former lagoon . Such dead portions of reef would generally lie on the leeward side ( Mr. Lyell , in the first edition of his `` Principles of Geology , '' offered a somewhat different explanation of this structure . He supposes that there has been subsidence ; but he was not aware that the submerged portions of reef were in most cases , if not in all , dead ; and he attributes the difference in height in the two sides of most atolls , chiefly to the greater accumulation of detritus to windward than to leeward . But as matter is accumulated only on the backward part of the reef , the front part would remain of the same height on both sides . I may here observe that in most cases ( for instance , at Peros Banhos , the Gambier group and the Great Chagos Bank ) , and I suspect in all cases , the dead and submerged portions do not blend or slope into the living and perfect parts , but are separated from them by an abrupt line . In some instances small patches of living reef rise to the surface from the middle of the submerged and dead parts . ) , for the impure water and fine sediment would more easily flow out from the lagoon over this side of the reef , where the force of the breakers is less than to windward ; and therefore the corals would be less vigorous on this side , and be less able to resist any destroying agent . It is likewise owing to this same cause , that reefs are more frequently breached to leeward by narrow channels , serving as by ship-channels , than to windward . If the corals perished entirely , or on the greater part of the circumference of an atoll , an atoll-shaped bank of dead rock , more or less entirely submerged , would be produced ; and further subsidence , together with the accumulation of sediment , would often obliterate its atoll-like structure , and leave only a bank with a level surface . In the Chagos group of atolls , within an area of 160 miles by 60 , there are two atoll-formed banks of dead rock ( besides another very imperfect one ) , entirely submerged ; a third , with merely two or three very small pieces of living reef rising to the surface ; and a fourth , namely , Peros Banhos ( Plate I. , Figure 9 ) , with a portion nine miles in length dead and submerged . As by our theory this area has subsided , and as there is nothing improbable in the death , either from changes in the state of the surrounding sea or from the subsidence being great or sudden , of the corals on the whole , or on portions of some of the atolls , the case of the Chagos group presents no difficulty . So far indeed are any of the above-mentioned cases of submerged reefs from being inexplicable , that their occurrence might have been anticipated on our theory , and as fresh atolls are supposed to be in progressive formation by the subsidence of encircling barrier-reefs , a weighty objection , namely that the number of atolls must be increasing infinitely , might even have been raised , if proofs of the occasional destruction and loss of atolls could not have been adduced . THE DISSEVERMENT OF THE LARGER MALDIVA ATOLLS . The apparent progressive disseverment in the Maldiva Archipelago of large atolls into smaller ones , is , in many respects , an important consideration , and requires an explanation . The graduated series which marks , as I believe , this process , can be observed only in the northern half of the group , where the atolls have exceedingly imperfect margins , consisting of detached basin-formed reefs . The currents of the sea flow across these atolls , as I am informed by Captain Moresby , with considerable force , and drift the sediment from side to side during the monsoons , transporting much of it seaward ; yet the currents sweep with greater force round their flanks . It is historically known that these atolls have long existed in their present state ; and we can believe , that even during a very slow subsidence they might thus remain , the central expanse being kept at nearly its original depth by the accumulation of sediment . But in the action of such nicely balanced forces during a progressive subsidence ( like that , to which by our theory this archipelago has been subjected ) , it would be strange if the currents of the sea should never make a direct passage across some one of the atolls , through the many wide breaches in their margins . If this were once effected , a deep-water channel would soon be formed by the removal of the finer sediment , and the check to its further accumulation ; and the sides of the channel would be worn into a slope like that on the outer coasts , which are exposed to the same force of the currents . In fact , a channel precisely like that bifurcating one which divides Mahlos Mahdoo ( Plate II. , Figure 4 . ) , would almost necessarily be formed . The scattered reefs situated near the borders of the new ocean-channel , from being favourably placed for the growth of coral , would , by their extension , tend to produce fresh margins to the dissevered portions ; such a tendency is very evident ( as may be seen in the large published chart ) in the elongated reefs on the borders of the two channels intersecting Mahlos Mahdoo . Such channels would become deeper with continued subsidence , and probably from the reefs not growing up perpendicularly , somewhat broader . In this case , and more especially if the channels had been formed originally of considerable breadth , the dissevered portions would become perfect and distinct atolls , like Ari and Ross atolls ( Plate II. , Figure 6 ) , or like the two Nillandoo atolls , which must be considered as distinct , although related in form and position , and separated from each other by channels , which though deep have been sounded . Further subsidence would render such channels unfathomable , and the dissevered portions would then resemble Phaleedoo and Moluque atolls , or Mahlos Mahdoo and Horsburgh atolls ( Plate II. , Figure 4 ) , which are related to each other in no respect except in proximity and position . Hence , on the theory of subsidence , the disseverment of large atolls , which have imperfect margins ( for otherwise their disseverment would be scarcely possible ) , and which are exposed to strong currents , is far from being an improbable event ; and the several stages , from close relation to entire isolation in the atolls of the Maldiva Archipelago , are readily explicable . We might go even further , and assert as not improbable , that the first formation of the Maldiva Archipelago was due to a barrier-reef , of nearly the same dimensions with that of New Caledonia ( Plate II. , Figure 5 ) , for if , in imagination , we complete the subsidence of that great island , we might anticipate from the present broken condition of the northern portion of the reef , and from the almost entire absence of reefs on the eastern coast , that the barrier-reef after repeated subsidences , would become during its upward growth separated into distinct portions ; and these portions would tend to assume an atoll-like structure , from the coral growing with vigour round their entire circumferences , when freely exposed to an open sea . As we have some large islands partly submerged with barrier-reefs marking their former limits , such as New Caledonia , so our theory makes it probable that there should be other large islands wholly submerged ; and these , we may now infer , would be surmounted , not by one enormous atoll , but by several large elongated ones , like the atolls in the Maldiva group ; and these again , during long periods of subsidence , would sometimes become dissevered into smaller atolls . I may add , that both in the Marshall and Caroline Archipelagoes , there are atolls standing close together , which have an evident relationship in form : we may suppose , in such cases , either that two or more encircled islands originally stood close together , and afforded bases for two or more atolls , or that one atoll has been dissevered . From the position , as well as form , of three atolls in the Caroline Archipelago ( the Namourrek and Elato group ) , which are placed in an irregular circle , I am strongly tempted to believe that they have originated by the process of disseverment . ( The same remark is , perhaps , applicable to the islands of Ollap , Fanadik , and Tamatam in the Caroline Archipelago , of which charts are given in the atlas of Duperrey's voyage : a line drawn through the linear reefs and lagoons of these three islands forms a semicircle . Consult also , the atlas of Lutke 's voyage ; and for the Marshall group that of Kotzebue ; for the Gilbert group consult the atlas of Duperrey 's voyage . Most of the points here referred to may , however , be seen in Krusenstern 's general Atlas of the Pacific . ) IRREGULARLY FORMED ATOLLS . In the Marshall group , Musquillo atoll consists of two loops united in one point ; and Menchikoff atoll is formed of three loops , two of which ( as may be seen in Figure 3 , Plate II . ) are connected by a mere ribbon-shaped reef , and the three together are sixty miles in length . In the Gilbert group some of the atolls have narrow strips of reef , like spurs , projecting from them . There occur also in parts of the open sea , a few linear and straight reefs , standing by themselves ; and likewise some few reefs in the form of crescents , with their extremities more or less curled inwards . Now , the upward growth of a barrier-reef which fronted only one side of an island , or one side of an elongated island with its extremities ( of which cases exist ) , would produce after the complete subsidence of the land , mere strips or crescent or hook-formed reefs : if the island thus partially fronted became divided during subsidence into two or more islands , these islands would be united together by linear reefs ; and from the further growth of the coral along their shores together with subsidence , reefs of various forms might ultimately be produced , either atolls united together by linear reefs , or atolls with spurs projecting from them . Some , however , of the more simple forms above specified , might , as we have seen , be equally well produced by the coral perishing during subsidence on part of the circumference of an atoll , whilst on the other parts it continued to grow up till it reached the surface . THE GREAT CHAGOS BANK . I have already shown that the submerged condition of the Great Chagos Bank ( Plate II. , Figure 1 , with its section Figure 2 ) , and of some other banks in the Chagos group , may in all probability be attributed to the coral having perished before or during the movements of subsidence , to which this whole area by our theory has been subjected . The external rim or upper ledge ( shaded in the chart ) , consists of dead coral-rock thinly covered with sand ; it lies at an average depth of between five and eight fathoms , and perfectly resembles in form the annular reef of an atoll . The banks of the second level , the boundaries of which are marked by dotted lines in the chart , lie from about fifteen to twenty fathoms beneath the surface ; they are several miles broad , and terminate in a very steep slope round the central expanse . This central expanse I have already described , as consisting of a level muddy flat between thirty and forty fathoms deep . The banks of the second level , might at first sight be thought analogous to the internal step-like ledge of coral-rock which borders the lagoons of some atolls , but their much greater width , and their being formed of sand , are points of essential difference . On the eastern side of the atoll some of the banks are linear and parallel , resembling islets in a great river , and pointed directly towards a great breach on the opposite side of the atoll ; these are best seen in the large published chart . I inferred from this circumstance , that strong currents sometimes set directly across this vast bank ; and I have since heard from Captain Moresby that this is the case . I observed , also , that the channels or breaches through the rim , were all of the same depth as the central lagoon-like space into which they lead ; whereas the channels into the other atolls of the Chagos group , and as I believe into most other large atolls , are not nearly as deep as their lagoons : for instance at Peros Banhos , the channels are only of the same depth , namely between ten and twenty fathoms , as the bottom of the lagoon for a space about a mile and a half in width round its shores , whilst the central expanse of the lagoon is from thirty-five to forty fathoms deep . Now , if an atoll during a gradual subsidence once became entirely submerged , like the Great Chagos Bank , and therefore no longer exposed to the surf , very little sediment could be formed from it ; and consequently the channels leading into the lagoon from not being filled up with drifted sand and coral detritus , would continue increasing in depth , as the whole sank down . In this case , we might expect that the currents of the open sea , instead of any longer sweeping round the submarine flanks , would flow directly through the breaches across the lagoon , removing in their course the finer sediment , and preventing its further accumulation . We should then have the submerged reef forming an external and upper rim of rock , and beneath this portion of the sandy bottom of the old lagoon , intersected by deep-water channels or breaches , and thus formed into separate marginal banks ; and these would be cut off by steep slopes , overhanging the central space , worn down by the passage of the oceanic currents . By these means , I have scarcely any doubt that the Great Chagos Bank has originated , -- a structure which at first appeared to me far more anomalous than any I had met with . The process of formation is nearly the same with that , by which Mahlos Mahdoo had been trisected ; but in the Chagos Bank the channels of the oceanic currents entering at several different quarters , have united in a central space . This great atoll-formed bank appears to be in an early stage of disseverment ; should the work of subsidence go on , from the submerged and dead condition of the whole reef , and the imperfection of the south-east quarter a mere wreck would probably be left . The Pitt 's Bank , situated not far southward , appears to be precisely in this state ; it consists of a moderately level , oblong bank of sand , lying from 10 to 20 fathoms beneath the surface , with two sides protected by a narrow ledge of rock which is submerged between 5 and 8 fathoms . A little further south , at about the same distance as the southern rim of the Great Chagos Bank is from the northern rim , there are two other small banks with from 10 to 20 fathoms on them ; and not far eastward soundings were struck on a sandy bottom , with between 110 and 145 fathoms . The northern portion with its ledge-like margin , closely resembles any one segment of the Great Chagos Bank , between two of the deep-water channels , and the scattered banks , southward appear to be the last wrecks of less perfect portions . I have examined with care the charts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , and have now brought before the reader all the examples , which I have met with , of reefs differing from the type of the class to which they belong ; and I think it has been satisfactorily shown , that they are all included in our theory , modified by occasional accidents which might have been anticipated as probable . In this course we have seen , that in the lapse of ages encircling barrier-reefs are occasionally converted into atolls , the name of atoll being properly applicable , at the moment when the last pinnacle of encircled land sinks beneath the surface of the sea . We have , also , seen that large atolls during the progressive subsidence of the areas in which they stand , sometimes become dissevered into smaller ones ; at other times , the reef-building polypifers having entirely perished , atolls are converted into atoll-formed banks of dead rock ; and these again through further subsidence and the accumulation of sediment modified by the force of the oceanic currents , pass into level banks with scarcely any distinguishing character . Thus may the history of an atoll be followed from its first origin , through the occasional accidents of its existence , to its destruction and final obliteration . OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF THE FORMATION OF ATOLLS AND BARRIER-REEFS . The vast amount of subsidence , both horizontally or in area , and vertically or in depth , necessary to have submerged every mountain , even the highest , throughout the immense spaces of ocean interspersed with atolls , will probably strike most people as a formidable objection to my theory . But as continents , as large as the spaces supposed to have subsided , have been raised above the level of the sea , -- as whole regions are now rising , for instance , in Scandinavia and South America , -- and as no reason can be assigned , why subsidences should not have occurred in some parts of the earth 's crust on as great a scale both in extent and amount as those of elevation , objections of this nature strike me as of little force . The remarkable point is that movements to such an extent should have taken place within a period , during which the polypifers have continued adding matter on and above the same reefs . Another and less obvious objection to the theory will perhaps be advanced from the circumstance , of the lagoons within atolls and within barrier-reefs never having become in any one instance during prolonged subsidences of a greater depth than sixty fathoms , and seldom more than forty fathoms ; but we already admit , if the theory be worth considering , that the rate of subsidence has not exceeded that of the upward growth of the coral on the exterior margin ; we are , therefore , only further required to admit , that the subsidence has not exceeded in rate the filling up of the interior spaces by the growth of the corals living there , and by the accumulation of sediment . As this filling up must take place very slowly within barrier-reefs lying far from the land , and within atolls which are of large dimensions and which have open lagoons with very few reefs , we are led to conclude that the subsidence thus counter-balanced , must have been slow in an extraordinary degree ; a conclusion which accords with our only means , namely , with what is known of the rate and manner of recent elevatory movements , of judging by analogy what is the probable rate of subsidence . In this chapter it has , I think , been shown , that the theory of subsidence , which we were compelled to receive from the necessity of giving to the corals , in certain large areas , foundations at the requisite depth , explains both the normal structure and the less regular forms of those two great classes of reefs , which have justly excited the astonishment of all persons who have sailed through the Pacific and Indian Oceans . But further to test the truth of the theory , a crowd of questions will occur to the reader : Do the different kinds of reefs , which have been produced by the same kind of movement , generally lie within the same areas ? What is their relation of form and position , -- for instance , do adjoining groups of atolls , and the separate atolls in these groups , bear the same relation to each other which islands do in common archipelagoes ? Have we reason to believe , that where there are fringing-reefs , there has not lately been subsidence ; or , for it is almost our only way of ascertaining this point , are there frequently proofs of recent elevation ? Can we by this means account for the presence of certain classes of reefs in some large areas , and their entire absence in others ? Do the areas which have subsided , as indicated by the presence of atolls and barrier-reefs , and the areas which have remained stationary or have been upraised , as shown by fringing-reefs , bear any determinate relation to each other ; and are the dimensions of these areas such as harmonise with the greatness of the subterranean changes , which , it must be supposed , have lately taken place beneath them ? Is there any connection between the movements thus indicated , and recent volcanic action ? All these questions ought to receive answers in accordance with the theory ; and if this can be satisfactorily shown , not only is the theory confirmed , but as deductions , the answers are in themselves important . Under this latter point of view , these questions will be chiefly considered in the following chapter . ( I may take this opportunity of briefly considering the appearances , which would probably be presented by a vertical and deep section across a coral formation ( referring chiefly to an atoll ) , formed by the upward growth of coral during successive subsidences . This is a subject worthy of attention , as a means of comparison with ancient coral-strata . The circumferential parts would consist of massive species , in a vertical position , with their interstices filled up with detritus ; but this would be the part most subject to subsequent denudation and removal . It is useless to speculate how large a portion of the exterior annular reef would consist of upright coral , and how much of fragmentary rock , for this would depend on many contingencies , -- such as on the rate of subsidence , occasionally allowing a fresh growth of coral to cover the whole surface , and on the breakers having force sufficient to throw fragments over this same space . The conglomerate which composes the base of the islets , would ( if not removed by denudation together with the exterior reef on which it rests ) be conspicuous from the size of the fragments , -- the different degrees in which they have been rounded , -- the presence of fragments of conglomerate torn up , rounded , and recemented , -- and from the oblique stratification . The corals which lived in the lagoon-reefs at each successive level , would be preserved upright , and they would consist of many kinds , generally much branched . In this part , however , a very large proportion of the rock ( and in some cases nearly all of it ) would be formed of sedimentary matter , either in an excessively fine , or in a moderately coarse state , and with the particles almost blended together . The conglomerate which was formed of rounded pieces of the branched corals , on the shores of the lagoon , would differ from that formed on the islets and derived from the outer coast ; yet both might have accumulated very near each other . I have seen a conglomerate limestone from Devonshire like a conglomerate now forming on the shores of the Maldiva atolls . The stratification taken as a whole , would be horizontal ; but the conglomerate beds resting on the exterior reef , and the beds of sandstone on the shores of the lagoon ( and no doubt on the external flanks ) would probably be divided ( as at Keeling atoll and at Mauritius ) by numerous layers dipping at considerable angles in different directions . The calcareous sandstone and coral-rock would almost necessarily contain innumerable shells , echini , and the bones of fish , turtle , and perhaps of birds ; possibly , also , the bones of small saurians , as these animals find their way to the islands far remote from any continent . The large shells of some species of Tridacna would be found vertically imbedded in the solid rock , in the position in which they lived . We might expect also to find a mixture of the remains of pelagic and littoral animals in the strata formed in the lagoon , for pumice and the seeds of plants are floated from distant countries into the lagoons of many atolls : on the outer coast of Keeling atoll , near the mouth of the lagoon , the case of a pelagic Pteropodous animal was brought up on the arming of the sounding lead . All the loose blocks of coral on Keeling atoll were burrowed by vermiform animals ; and as every cavity , no doubt , ultimately becomes filled with spathose limestone , slabs of the rock taken from a considerable depth , would , if polished , probably exhibit the excavations of such burrowing animals . The conglomerate and fine-grained beds of coral-rock would be hard , sonorous , white and composed of nearly pure calcareous matter ; in some few parts , judging from the specimens at Keeling atoll , they would probably contain a small quantity of iron . Floating pumice and scoriae , and occasionally stones transported in the root of trees ( see my '' Journal of Researches , '' page 549 ) appear the only sources , through which foreign matter is brought to coral-formations standing in the open ocean . The area over which sediment is transported from coral-reefs must be considerable : Captain Moresby informs me that during the change of monsoons the sea is discoloured to a considerable distance off the Maldiva and Chagos atolls . The sediment of fringing and barrier coral-reefs must be mingled with the mud , which is brought down from the land , and is transported seaward through the breaches , which occur in front of almost every valley . If the atolls of the larger archipelagoes were upraised , the bed of the ocean being converted into land , they would form flat-topped mountains , varying in diameter from a few miles ( the smallest atolls being worn away ) to sixty miles ; and from being horizontally stratified and of similar composition , they would , as Mr. Lyell has remarked , falsely appear as if they had originally been united into one vast continuous mass . Such great strata of coral-rock would rarely be associated with erupted volcanic matter , for this could only take place , as may be inferred from what follows in the next chapter , when the area , in which they were situated , commenced to rise , or at least ceased to subside . During the enormous period necessary to effect an elevation of the kind just alluded to , the surface would necessarily be denuded to a great thickness ; hence it is highly improbable that any fringing-reef , or even any barrier-reef , at least of those encircling small islands , would be preserved . From this same cause , the strata which were formed within the lagoons of atolls and lagoon-channels of barrier-reefs , and which must consist in a large part of sedimentary matter , would more often be preserved to future ages , than the exterior solid reef , composed of massive corals in an upright position ; although it is on this exterior part that the present existence and further growth of atolls and barrier-reefs entirely depend . CHAPTER VI. -- ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS WITH REFERENCE TO THE THEORY OF THEIR FORMATION . ( DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES . PLATE III. -- MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS AND ACTIVE VOLCANOES . The principles , on which this map was coloured , are explained in the beginning of Chapter VI . ; and the authorities for each particular spot are detailed in the Appendix to `` Coral Reefs . '' The names not printed in upper case in the Index refer to the Appendix . ) Description of the coloured map. -- Proximity of atolls and barrier-reefs. -- Relation in form and position of atolls with ordinary islands. -- Direct evidence of subsidence difficult to be detected. -- Proofs of recent elevation where fringing-reefs occur. -- Oscillations of level. -- Absence of active volcanoes in the areas of subsidence. -- Immensity of the areas which have been elevated and have subsided. -- Their relation to the present distribution of the land. -- Areas of subsidence elongated , their intersection and alternation with those of elevation. -- Amount and slow rate of the subsidence. -- Recapitulation . It will be convenient to give here a short account of the appended map ( Plate III . ) [ Inasmuch as the coloured map would have proved too costly to be given in this series , the indications of colour have been replaced by numbers referring to the dotted groups of reefs , etc . The author's original wording , however , is retained in full , as it will be easy to refer to the map by the numbers , and thus the flow of the narrative is undisturbed . ] : a fuller one , with the data for colouring each spot , is reserved for the Appendix ; and every place there referred to may be found in the Index . A larger chart would have been desirable ; but , small as the adjoined one is , it is the result of many months ' labour . I have consulted , as far as I was able , every original voyage and map ; and the colours were first laid down on charts on a larger scale . The same blue colour , with merely a difference in the depth of tint , is used for atolls or lagoon-islands , and barrier-reefs , for we have seen , that as far as the actual coral-formation is concerned , they have no distinguishing character . Fringing-reefs have been coloured red , for between them on the one hand , and barrier-reefs and atolls on the other , there is an important distinction with respect to the depth beneath the surface , at which we are compelled to believe their foundations lie . The two distinct colours , therefore , mark two great types of structure . The DARK BLUE COLOUR [ represented by ( 3 ) in our plate ] represents atolls and submerged annular reefs , with deep water in their centres . I have coloured as atolls , a few low and small coral-islands , without lagoons ; but this has been done only when it clearly appeared that they originally contained lagoons , since filled up with sediment : when there were not good grounds for this belief , they have been left uncoloured . The PALE BLUE COLOUR [ represented by ( 2 ) ] represents barrier-reefs . The most obvious character of reefs of this class is the broad and deep-water moat within the reef : but this , like the lagoons of small atolls , is liable to become filled up with detritus and with reefs of delicately branched corals : when , therefore , a reef round the entire circumference of an island extends very far into a profoundly deep sea , so that it can hardly be confounded with a fringing-reef which must rest on a foundation of rock within a small depth , it has been coloured pale blue , although it does not include a deep-water moat : but this has only been done rarely , and each case is distinctly mentioned in the Appendix . The RED COLOUR ( 4 ) represents reefs fringing the land quite closely where the sea is deep , and where the bottom is gently inclined extending to a moderate distance from it , but not having a deep-water moat or lagoon-like space parallel to the shore . It must be remembered that fringing-reefs are frequently BREACHED in front of rivers and valleys by deepish channels , where mud has been deposited . A space of thirty miles in width has been coloured round or in front of the reefs of each class , in order that the colours might be conspicuous on the appended map , which is reduced to so small a scale . The VERMILLION SPOTS , and streaks ( 1 ) represent volcanoes now in action , or historically known to have been so . They are chiefly laid down from Von Buch 's work on the Canary Islands ; and my reasons for making a few alterations are given in the note below . ( I have also made considerable use of the geological part of Berghaus' '' Physical Atlas . '' Beginning at the eastern side of the Pacific , I have added to the number of the volcanoes in the southern part of the Cordillera , and have coloured Juan Fernandez according to observations collected during the voyage of the `` Beagle '' ( `` Geological Transactions , '' volume v. , page 601 . ) I have added a volcano to Albemarle Island , one of the Galapagos Archipelago ( the author 's `` Journal of Researches , '' page 457 ) . In the Sandwich group there are no active volcanoes , except at Hawaii ; but the Rev . W. Ellis informs me , there are streams of lava apparently modern on Maui , having a very recent appearance , which can be traced to the craters whence they flowed . The same gentleman informs me , that there is no reason to believe that any active volcano exists in the Society Archipelago ; nor are there any known in the Samoa or Navigator group , although some of the streams of lava and craters there appear recent . In the Friendly group , the Rev . J. Williams says ( `` Narrative of Missionary Enterprise , '' page 29 ) that Toofoa and Proby Islands are active volcanoes . I infer from Hamilton 's `` Voyage in the 'Pandora ' '' ( Page 95 ) , that Proby Island is synonymous with Onouafou , but I have not ventured to colour it . There can be no doubt respecting Toofoa , and Captain Edwards ( Von Buch , page 386 ) found the lava of recent eruption at Amargura still smoking . Berghaus marks four active volcanoes actually within the Friendly group ; but I do not know on what authority : I may mention that Maurelle describes Latte as having a burnt-up appearance : I have marked only Toofoa and Amargura . South of the New Hebrides lies Matthews Rock , which is drawn and described as an active crater in the `` Voyage of the 'Astrolabe ' . '' Between it and the volcano on the eastern side of New Zealand , lies Brimstone Island , which from the high temperature of the water in the crater , may be ranked as active ( Berghaus `` Vorbemerk , '' II Lief . S. 56 ) . Malte Brun , volume xii. , page 231 , says that there is a volcano near port St. Vincent in New Caledonia . I believe this to be an error , arising from a smoke seen on the OPPOSITE coast by Cook ( `` Second Voyage , '' volume ii. , page 23 ) which smoke went out at night . The Mariana Islands , especially the northern ones , contain many craters ( see Freycinet 's `` Hydrog . Descript . '' ) which are not active . Von Buch , however , states ( page 462 ) on the authority of La Peyrouse , that there are no less than seven volcanoes between these islands and Japan . Gemelli Creri ( Churchill 's `` Collect . '' volume iv. , page 458 ) , says there are two active volcanoes in latitude 23 deg 30 ' , and in latitude 24 deg : but I have not coloured them . From the statements in Beechey's '' Voyage '' ( page 518 , 4to edition ) I have coloured one in the northern part of the Bonin group . M. S. Julien has clearly made out from Chinese manuscripts not very ancient ( `` Comptes Rendus , '' 1840 , page 832 ) , that there are two active volcanoes on the eastern side of Formosa . In Torres Straits , on Cap Island ( 9 deg 48 ' S. , 142 deg 39 ' E. ) a volcano was seen burning with great violence in 1793 by Captain Bampton ( see Introduction to Flinders ' `` Voyage , '' page 41 ) . Mr. M'Clelland ( Report of Committee for investigating Coal in India , page 39 ) has shown that the volcanic band passing through Barren Island must be extended northwards . It appears by an old chart , that Cheduba was once an active volcano ( see also `` Silliman's North American Journal '' , volume xxxviii. , page 385 ) . In Berghaus' '' Physical Atlas , '' 1840 , No . 7 of Geological Part , a volcano on the coast of Pondicherry is said to have burst forth in 1757 . Ordinaire ( `` Hist . Nat . des Volcans , '' page 218 ) says that there is one at the mouth of the Persian Gulf , but I have not coloured it , as he gives no particulars . A volcano in Amsterdam , or St. Paul 's , in the southern part of the Indian Ocean , has been seen ( `` Naut . Mag . '' 1838 , page 842 ) in action . Dr. J. Allan , of Forres , informs me in a letter , that when he was at Joanna , he saw at night flames apparently volcanic , issuing from the chief Comoro Island , and that the Arabs assured him that they were volcanic , adding that the volcano burned more during the wet season . I have marked this as a volcano , though with some hesitation , on account of the possibility of the flame arising from gaseous sources . ) The uncoloured coasts consist , first and chiefly , of those , where there are no coral-reefs , or such small portions as to be quite insignificant . Secondly , of those coasts where there are reefs , but where the sea is very shallow , for in this case the reefs generally lie far from the land , and become very irregular , in their forms : where they have not become irregular , they have been coloured . thirdly , if I had the means of ascertaining the fact , I should not colour a reef merely coating the edges of a submarine crater , or of a level submerged bank ; for such superficial formations differ essentially , even when not in external appearance , from reefs whose foundations as well as superficies have been wholly formed by the growth of coral . Fourthly , in the Red Sea , and within some parts of the East Indian Archipelago ( if the imperfect charts of the latter can be trusted ) , there are many scattered reefs , of small size , represented in the chart by mere dots , which rise out of deep water : these can not be arranged under either of the three classes : in the Red Sea , however , some of these little reefs , from their position , seem once to have formed parts of a continuous barrier . There exist , also , scattered in the open ocean , some linear and irregularly formed strips of coral-reef , which , as shown in the last chapter , are probably allied in their origin to atolls ; but as they do not belong to that class , they have not been coloured ; they are very few in number and of insignificant dimensions . Lastly , some reefs are left uncoloured from the want of information respecting them , and some because they are of an intermediate structure between the barrier and fringing classes . The value of the map is lessened , in proportion to the number of reefs which I have been obliged to leave uncoloured , although , in a theoretical point of view , few of them present any great difficulty : but their number is not very great , as will be found by comparing the map with the statements in the Appendix . I have experienced more difficulty in colouring fringing-reefs than in colouring barrier-reefs , as the former , from their much less dimensions , have less attracted the attention of navigators . As I have had to seek my information from all kinds of sources , and often from indirect ones , I do not venture to hope that the map is free from many errors . Nevertheless , I trust it will give an approximately correct view of the general distribution of the coral-reefs over the whole world ( with the exception of some fringing-reefs on the coast of Brazil , not included within the limits of the map ) , and of their arrangement into the three great classes , which , though necessarily very imperfect from the nature of the objects classified , have been adopted by most voyagers . I may further remark , that the dark blue colour represents land entirely composed of coral-rock ; the pale blue , land with a wide and thick border of coral-rock ; and the red , a mere narrow fringe of coral-rock . Looking now at the map under the theoretical point of view indicated in the last chapter , the two blue tints signify that the foundations of the reefs thus coloured have subsided to a considerable amount , at a slower rate than that of the upward growth of the corals , and that probably in many cases they are still subsiding . The red signifies that the shores which support fringing-reefs have not subsided ( at least to any considerable amount , for the effects of a subsidence on a small scale would in no case be distinguishable ) ; but that they have remained nearly stationary since the period when they first became fringed by reefs ; or that they are now rising or have been upraised , with new lines of reefs successively formed on them : these latter alternatives are obviously implied , as newly formed lines of shore , after elevations of the land , would be in the same state with respect to the growth of fringing-reefs , as stationary coasts . If during the prolonged subsidence of a shore , coral-reefs grew for the first time on it , or if an old barrier-reef were destroyed and submerged , and new reefs became attached to the land , these would necessarily at first belong to the fringing class , and , therefore , be coloured red , although the coast was sinking : but I have no reason to believe , that from this source of error , any coast has been coloured wrongly with respect to movement indicated . Well characterised atolls and encircling barrier-reefs , where several occur in a group , or a single barrier-reef if of large dimensions , leave scarcely any doubt on the mind respecting the movement by which they have been produced ; and even a small amount of subsequent elevation is soon betrayed . The evidence from a single atoll or a single encircling barrier-reef , must be received with some caution , for the former may possibly be based upon a submerged crater or bank , and the latter on a submerged margin of sediment , or of worn-down rock . From these remarks we may with greater certainty infer that the spaces , especially the larger ones , tinted blue in the map , have subsided , than that the red spaces have remained stationary , or have been upraised . ON THE GROUPING OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF REEFS . Having made these preliminary remarks , I will consider first how far the grouping of the different kinds of coral-islands and reefs is corroborative of the truth of the theory . A glance at the map shows that the reefs , coloured blue and red , produced under widely different conditions , are not indiscriminately mixed together . Atolls and barrier-reefs , on the other hand , as may be seen by the two blue tints , generally lie near each other ; and this would be the natural result of both having been produced during the subsidence of the areas in which they stand . Thus , the largest group of encircled islands is that of the Society Archipelago ; and these islands are surrounded by atolls , and only separated by a narrow space from the large group of Low atolls . In the midst of the Caroline atolls , there are three fine encircled islands . The northern point of the barrier-reef of New Caledonia seems itself , as before remarked , to form a complete large atoll . The great Australian barrier is described as including both atolls and small encircled islands . Captain King ( Sailing directions , appended to volume ii . of his `` Surveying Voyage to Australia . '' ) mentions many atoll-formed and encircling coral-reefs , some of which lie within the barrier , and others may be said ( for instance between latitude 16 deg and 13 deg ) to form part of it . Flinders ( `` Voyage to Terra Australis , '' volume ii . page 336 . ) has described an atoll-formed reef in latitude 10 deg , seven miles long and from one to three broad , resembling a boot in shape , with apparently very deep water within . Eight miles westward of this , and forming part of the barrier , lie the Murray Islands , which are high and are encircled . In the Corallian Sea , between the two great barriers of Australia and New Caledonia , there are many low islets and coral-reefs , some of which are annular , or horse-shoe shaped . Observing the smallness of the scale of the map , the parallels of latitude being nine hundred miles apart , we see that none of the large groups of reefs and islands supposed to have been produced by long-continued subsidence , lie near extensive lines of coast coloured red , which are supposed to have remained stationary since the growth of their reefs , or to have been upraised and new lines of reefs formed on them . Where the red and blue circles do occur near each other , I am able , in several instances , to show that there have been oscillations of level , subsidence having preceded the elevation of the red spots ; and elevation having preceded the subsidence of the blue spots : and in this case the juxtaposition of reefs belonging to the two great types of structure is little surprising . We may , therefore , conclude that the proximity in the same areas of the two classes of reefs , which owe their origin to the subsidence of the earth 's crust , and their separation from those formed during its stationary or uprising condition , holds good to the full extent , which might have been anticipated by our theory . As groups of atolls have originated in the upward growth , at each fresh sinking of the land , of those reefs which primarily fringed the shores of one great island , or of several smaller ones ; so we might expect that these rings of coral-rock , like so many rude outline charts , will still retain some traces of the general form , or at least general range , of the land , round which they were first modelled . That this is the case with the atolls in the Southern Pacific as far as their range is concerned , seems highly probable , when we observe that the three principal groups are directed in north-west and south-east lines , and that nearly all the land in the S. Pacific ranges in this same direction ; namely , N. Western Australia , New Caledonia , the northern half of New Zealand , the New Hebrides , Saloman , Navigator , Society , Marquesas , and Austral archipelagoes : in the Northern Pacific , the Caroline atolls abut against the north-west line of the Marshall atolls , much in the same manner as the east and west line of islands from Ceram to New Britain do on New Ireland : in the Indian Ocean the Laccadive and Maldiva atolls extend nearly parallel to the western and mountainous coast of India . In most respects , there is a perfect resemblance with ordinary islands in the grouping of atolls and in their form : thus the outline of all the larger groups is elongated ; and the greater number of the individual atolls are elongated in the same direction with the group , in which they stand . The Chagos group is less elongated than is usual with other groups , and the individual atolls in it are likewise but little elongated ; this is strikingly seen by comparing them with the neighbouring Maldiva atolls . In the Marshall and Maldiva archipelagoes , the atolls are ranged in two parallel lines , like the mountains in a great double mountain-chain . Some of the atolls , in the larger archipelagoes , stand so near to each other , and have such an evident relationship in form , that they compose little sub-groups : in the Caroline Archipelago , one such sub-group consists of Pouynipete , a lofty island encircled by a barrier-reef , and separated by a channel only four miles and a half wide from Andeema atoll , with a second atoll a little further off . In all these respects an examination of a series of charts will show how perfectly groups of atolls resemble groups of common islands . ON THE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THE BLUE SPACES IN THE MAP HAVING SUBSIDED DURING THE UPWARD GROWTH OF THE REEFS SO COLOURED , AND OF THE RED SPACES HAVING REMAINED STATIONARY , OR HAVING BEEN UPRAISED . With respect to subsidence , I have shown in the last chapter , that we can not expect to obtain in countries inhabited only by semi-civilised races , demonstrative proofs of a movement , which invariably tends to conceal its own evidence . But on the coral-islands supposed to have been produced by subsidence , we have proofs of changes in their external appearance -- of a round of decay and renovation -- of the last vestiges of land on some -- of its first commencement on others : we hear of storms desolating them to the astonishment of their inhabitants : we know by the great fissures with which some of them are traversed , and by the earthquakes felt under others , that subterranean disturbances of some kind are in progress . These facts , if not directly connected with subsidence , as I believe they are , at least show how difficult it would be to discover proofs of such movement by ordinary means . At Keeling atoll , however , I have described some appearances , which seem directly to show that subsidence did take place there during the late earthquakes . Vanikoro , according to Chevalier Dillon ( See Captain Dillon 's `` Voyage in search of La Peyrouse . '' M. Cordier in his `` Report on the Voyage of the 'Astrolabe ' '' ( page cxi. , volume i . ) , speaking of Vanikoro , says the shores are surrounded by reefs of madrepore , `` qu'on assure etre de formation tout-a-fait moderne . '' I have in vain endeavoured to learn some further particulars about this remarkable passage . I may here add , that according to our theory , the island of Pouynipete ( Plate I. , Figure 7 ) , in the Caroline Archipelago , being encircled by a barrier-reef , must have subsided . In the `` New S. Wales Lit . Advert . '' February 1835 ( which I have seen through the favour of Dr. Lloghtsky ) , there is an account of this island ( subsequently confirmed by Mr. Campbell ) , in which it is said , `` At the N.E . end , at a place called Tamen , there are ruins of a town , NOW ONLY accessible by boats , the waves REACHING TO THE STEPS OF The HOUSES . '' Judging from this passage , one would be tempted to conclude that the island must have subsided , since these houses were built . I may , also , here append a statement in Malte Brun ( volume ix. , page 775 , given without any authority ) , that the sea gains in an extraordinary manner on the coast of Cochin China , which lies in front and near the subsiding coral-reefs in the China Sea : as the coast is granitic , and not alluvial , it is scarcely possible that the encroachment of the sea can be owing to the washing away of the land ; and if so , it must be due to subsidence . ) , is often violently shaken by earthquakes , and there , the unusual depth of the channel between the shore and the reef , -- the almost entire absence of islets on the reef , -- its wall-like structure on the inner side , and the small quantity of low alluvial land at the foot of the mountains , all seem to show that this island has not remained long at its present level , with the lagoon-channel subjected to the accumulation of sediment , and the reef to the wear and tear of the breakers . At the Society Archipelago , on the other hand , where a slight tremor is only rarely felt , the shoaliness of the lagoon-channels round some of the islands , the number of islets formed on the reefs of others , and the broad belt of low land at the foot of the mountains , indicate that , although there must have been great subsidence to have produced the barrier-reefs , there has since elapsed a long stationary period . ( Mr. Couthouy states ( `` Remarks , '' page 44 ) that at Tahiti and Eimeo the space between the reef and the shore has been nearly filled up by the extension of those coral-reefs , which within most barrier-reefs merely fringe the land . From this circumstance , he arrives at the same conclusion as I have done , that the Society Islands since their subsidence , have remained stationary during a long period ; but he further believes that they have recently commenced rising , as well as the whole area of the Low Archipelago . He does not give any detailed proofs regarding the elevation of the Society Islands , but I shall refer to this subject in another part of this chapter . Before making some further comments , I may observe how satisfactory it is to me , to find Mr. Couthouy affirming , that `` having personally examined a large number of coral-islands , and also residing eight months among the volcanic class , having shore and partially encircling reefs , I may be permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a conviction of the correctness of the theory of Mr . This gentleman believes , that subsequently to the subsidence by which the atolls in the Low Archipelago were produced , the whole area has been elevated to the amount of a few feet ; this would indeed be a remarkable fact ; but as far as I am able to judge , the grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong . He states that he found in almost every atoll which he visited , the shores of the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the sea-level , and containing imbedded Tridacnae and corals standing as they grew ; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts , but below a certain line they continued to flourish . In the lagoons , also , he frequently met with clusters of Madrepore , with their extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of the water . Now , these appearances are exactly what I should have expected , without any subsequent elevation having taken place ; and I think Mr. Couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact , that corals , when constantly bathed by the surf , can exist at a higher level than in quite tranquil water , as in a lagoon . As long , therefore , as the waves continued at low water to break entirely over parts of the annular reef of an atoll , submerged to a small depth , the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon , into which the waves rolled ; but as soon as the outer edge of the reef grew up to its utmost possible height , or if the reef were very broad nearly to that height , the force of the breakers would be checked , and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the lagoon would occasionally be left dry , and thus be partially or wholly destroyed . Even in atolls , which have not lately subsided , if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth seaward ( each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical height as at Keeling atoll ) , the line where the waves broke most heavily would advance outwards , and therefore the corals , which when living near the margin , were washed by the breaking waves during the whole of each tide , would cease being so , and would therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed and dead . The case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops of their branches exposed , seems to be an analogous fact , to the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of Keeling atoll ; a condition of things which I have endeavoured to show , has resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and choked up with reefs , so that during high winds , the rising of the tide ( as observed by the inhabitants ) is checked , and the corals , which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height , are occasionally exposed , and thus are killed : and this is a condition of things , towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its subsidence must be tending . Or if we look to the state of an atoll directly after a subsidence of some fathoms , the waves would roll heavily over the entire circumference of the reef , and the surface of the lagoon would , like the ocean , never be quite at rest , and therefore the corals in the lagoon , from being constantly laved by the rippling water , might extend their branches to a little greater height than they could , when the lagoon became enclosed and protected . Christmas atoll ( 2 deg N. latitude ) which has a very shallow lagoon , and differs in several respects from most atolls , possibly may have been elevated recently ; but its highest part appears ( Couthouy , page 46 ) to be only ten feet above the sea-level . The facts of a second class , adduced by Mr. Couthouy , in support of the alleged recent elevation of the Low Archipelago , are not all ( especially those referring to a shelf of rock ) quite intelligible to me ; he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the reef , must have been moved into their present position , when the reef was at a lower level ; but here again the force of the breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward growth without any change in its level , has not , I think , been borne in mind . We should , also , not overlook the occasional agency of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes . Mr. Couthouy further argues , that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed on the reef , they have been elevated ; he infers this from the greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases , where they are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides , but at some height on their sides , near the line of high-water mark , as shown in an accompanying diagram . My former remark again applies here , with this further observation , that as the waves have to roll over a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments , their force must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the tide rises , and therefore I should have expected that the chief line of present erosion would have coincided with the line of high-water mark ; and if the reef had grown outwards , that there would have been lines of erosion at greater heights . The conclusion , to which I am finally led by the interesting observations of Mr. Couthouy is , that the atolls in the Low Archipelago have , like the Society Islands , remained at a stationary level for a long period : and this probably is the ordinary course of events , subsidence supervening after long intervals of rest . ) Turning now to the red colour ; as on our map , the areas which have sunk slowly downwards to great depths are many and large , we might naturally have been led to conjecture , that with such great changes of level in progress , the coasts which have been fringed probably for ages ( for we have no reason to believe that coral-reefs are of short duration ) , would not have remained all this time stationary , but would frequently have undergone movements of elevation . This supposition , we shall immediately see , holds good to a remarkable extent ; and although a stationary condition of the land can hardly ever be open to proof , from the evidence being only negative , we are , in some degree , enabled to ascertain the correctness of the parts coloured red on the map , by the direct testimony of upraised organic remains of a modern date . Before going into the details on this head ( printed in small type ) , I may mention , that when reading a memoir on coral formations by MM . Quoy and Gaimard ( `` Annales des Sciences Nat . '' tom . vi. , page 279 , etc . ) I was astonished to find , for I knew that they had crossed both the Pacific and Indian Oceans , that their descriptions were applicable only to reefs of the fringing class ; but my astonishment ended satisfactorily , when I discovered that , by a strange chance , all the islands which these eminent naturalists had visited , though several in number , namely , the Mauritius , Timor , New Guinea , the Mariana , and Sandwich Archipelagoes , could be shown by their own statements to have been elevated within a recent geological era . In the eastern half of the Pacific , the SANDWICH Islands are all fringed , and almost every naturalist who has visited them , has remarked on the abundance of elevated corals and shells , apparently identical with living species . The Rev . W. Ellis informs me , that he has noticed round several parts of Hawaii , beds of coral-detritus , about twenty feet above the level of the sea , and where the coast is low they extend far inland . Upraised coral-rock forms a considerable part of the borders of Oahu ; and at Elizabeth Island ( `` Zoology of Captain Beechey 's Voyage , '' page 176 . See also MM . Quoy and Gaimard in `` Annales de Scien . Nat . '' tom . vi . ) it composes three strata , each about ten feet thick . Nihau , which forms the northern , as Hawaii does the southern end of the group ( 350 miles in length ) , likewise seems to consist of coral and volcanic rocks . Mr. Couthouy ( `` Remarks on Coral Formations , '' page 51 . ) has lately described with interesting details , several upraised beaches , ancient reefs with their surfaces perfectly preserved , and beds of recent shells and corals , at the islands of Maui , Morokai , Oahu , and Tauai ( or Kauai ) in this group . Mr. Pierce , an intelligent resident at Oahu , is convinced , from changes which have taken place within his memory , during the last sixteen years , `` that the elevation is at present going forward at a very perceptible rate . '' The natives at Kauai state that the land is there gaining rapidly on the sea , and Mr. Couthouy has no doubt , from the nature of the strata , that this has been effected by an elevation of the land . In the southern part of the Low Archipelago , Elizabeth Island is described by Captain Beechey ( Beechey 's `` Voyage in the Pacific , '' page 46 , 4to edition . ) , as being quite flat , and about eighty feet in height ; it is entirely composed of dead corals , forming a honeycombed , but compact rock . In cases like this , of an island having exactly the appearance , which the elevation of any one of the smaller surrounding atolls with a shallow lagoon would present , one is led to conclude ( with little better reason , however , than the improbability of such small and low fabrics lasting , for an immense period , exposed to the many destroying agents of nature ) , that the elevation has taken place at an epoch not geologically remote . When merely the surface of an island of ordinary formation is strewed with marine bodies , and that continuously , or nearly so , from the beach to a certain height , and not above that height , it is exceedingly improbable that such organic remains , although they may not have been specially examined , should belong to any ancient period . It is necessary to bear these remarks in mind , in considering the evidence of the elevatory movements in the Pacific and Indian Oceans , as it does not often rest on specific determinations , and therefore should be received with caution . Six of the COOK AND AUSTRAL Islands ( S.W . of the Society group ) , are fringed ; of these , five were described to me by the Rev . J. Williams , as formed of coral-rock , associated with some basalt in Mangaia ) , and the sixth as lofty and basaltic . Many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight into problems regarding the structure and changes of the earth 's surface , and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical geology and physiography in their application to special domains . The three introductions , which my friend Professor Judd has kindly furnished , give critical and historical information which makes this edition of special value . G.T.B . CORAL REEFS .

A scientific discovery is the outcome of an interesting process of evolution in the mind of its author . When we are able to detect the germs of thought in which such a discovery has originated , and to trace the successive stages of the reasoning by which the crude idea has developed into an epoch-making book , we have the materials for reconstructing an important chapter of scientific history . The subject of corals and coral-reefs is one concerning which much popular misconception has always prevailed . The misleading comparison of coral-rock with the combs of bees and the nests of wasps is perhaps responsible for much of this misunderstanding ; one writer has indeed described a coral-reef as being `` built by fishes by means of their teeth . '' Scarcely less misleading , however , are the references we so frequently meet with , both in prose and verse , to the `` skill , '' `` industry , '' and `` perseverance '' of the `` coral-insect '' in `` building '' his `` home . '' As well might we praise men for their cleverness in making their own skeletons , and laud their assiduity in filling churchyards with the same . The polyps and other organisms , whose remains accumulate to form a coral-reef , simply live and perform their natural functions , and then die , leaving behind them , in the natural course of events , the hard calcareous portions of their structures to add to the growing reef . While the forms of coral-reefs and coral-islands are sometimes very remarkable and worthy of attentive study , there is no ground , it need scarcely be added , for the suggestion that they afford proofs of design on the part of the living builders , or that , in the words of Flinders , they constitute breastworks , defending the workshops from whence `` infant colonies might be safely sent forth . '' It was not till the beginning of the present century that travellers like Beechey , Chamisso , Quoy and Gaimard , Moresby , Nelson , and others , began to collect accurate details concerning the forms and structure of coral-masses , and to make such observations on the habits of reef-forming polyps , as might serve as a basis for safe reasoning concerning the origin of coral-reefs and islands . In the second volume of Lyell 's `` Principles of Geology , '' published in 1832 , the final chapter gives an admirable summary of all that was then known on the subject . At that time , the ring-form of the atolls was almost universally regarded as a proof that they had grown up on submerged volcanic craters ; and Lyell gave his powerful support to that theory . I had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs . But it should be observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly attending to the effects on the shores of South America of the intermittent elevation of the land , together with the denudation and deposition of sediment . This necessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence , and it was easy to replace in imagination the continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals . To do this was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls . '' With characteristic modesty , he told me that he never fully realised the importance of his theory of coral-reefs till he had an opportunity of discussing it with Lyell , shortly after the return of the '' Beagle '' . Lyell , on receiving from the lips of its author a sketch of the new theory , was so overcome with delight that he danced about and threw himself into the wildest contortions , as was his manner when excessively pleased . It is all true , but do not flatter yourself that you will be believed till you are growing bald like me , with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world . '' I must give up my volcanic crater forever , though it cost me a pang at first , for it accounted for so much . '' Many delays from ill-health and the interruption of other work , caused the progress to be slow , and his journal speaks of `` recommencing '' the subject in February 1839 , shortly after his marriage , and again in October of the same year . In July 1841 , he states that he began once more '' after more than thirteen month 's interval , '' and the last proof-sheet of the book was not corrected till May 6th , 1842 . Lyell 's anticipation that the theory of coral-reefs would be slow in meeting with general acceptance was certainly not justified by the actual facts . On the contrary the new book was at once received with general assent among both geologists and zoologists , and even attracted a considerable amount of attention from the general public . Two years after the return of the '' Beagle '' to England , the ships of the United States Exploring Expedition set sail upon their four years ' cruise , under the command of Captain Wilkes , and Dana was a member of the scientific staff . The Gambier Islands in the Paumotus , which gave him the key to the theory , I had not seen ; but on reaching the Feejees , six months later , in 1840 , I found there similar facts on a still grander scale and of a more diversified character , so that I was afterward enabled to speak of his theory as established with more positiveness than he himself , in his philosophic caution , had been ready to adopt . His work on coral-reefs appeared in 1842 , when my report on the subject was already in manuscript . It showed that the conclusions on other points , which we had independently reached , were for the most part the same . The principal points of difference relate to the reason for the absence of corals from some coasts , and the evidence therefrom as to changes of level , and the distribution of the oceanic regions of elevation and subsidence -- topics which a wide range of travel over the Pacific brought directly and constantly to my attention . '' Among the Reports of the United States Exploring Expedition , two important works from the pen of Professor Dana made their appearance ; -- one on '' Zoophytes , '' which treats at length on `` Corals and Coral-Animals , '' and the other on `` Coral-Reefs and Islands . '' In 1872 , Dana prepared a work of a more popular character in which some of the chief results of his studies are described ; it bore the title of `` Corals and Coral-Islands . '' Of this work , new and enlarged editions appeared in 1874 and 1890 in America , while two editions were published in this country in 1872 and 1875 . Another able exponent and illustrator of the theory of coral-reefs was found in Professor J.B. Jukes , who accompanied H.M.S . `` Fly '' , as naturalist , during the survey of the Great Barrier-Reef -- in the years 1842 to 1846 . In 1859 Baron von Richthofen brought forward new facts in its support , by showing that the existence of the thick masses of dolomitic limestone in the Tyrol could be best accounted for if they were regarded as of coralline origin and as being formed during a period of long continued subsidence . The same views were maintained by Professor Mojsisovics in his '' Dolomit-riffe von Sudtirol und Venetien , '' which appeared in 1879 . The first serious note of dissent to the generally accepted theory was heard in 1863 , when a distinguished German naturalist , Dr. Karl Semper , declared that his study of the Pelew Islands showed that uninterrupted subsidence could not have been going on in that region . But while making this admission , he firmly maintained that exceptional cases , like those described in the Pelew Islands , were not sufficient to invalidate the theory of subsidence as applied to the widely spread atolls , encircling reefs , and barrier-reefs of the Pacific and Indian Oceans . After the appearance of Semper 's work , Dr. J.J. Rice in 1884 and Professor A. Heilprin in 1889 -- and they have independently arrived at the conclusion that Dr . Rein 's objections can not be maintained . `` Challenger '' from her famous voyage . Mr. John Murray , one of the staff of naturalists on board that vessel , propounded a new theory of coral-reefs , and maintained that the view that they were formed by subsidence was one that was no longer tenable ; these objections have been supported by Professor Alexander Agassiz in the United States , and by Dr. A. Geikie , and Dr. H.B . Guppy in this country . He admitted to me that had he known , when he wrote his work , of the abundant deposition of the remains of calcareous organisms on the sea floor , he might have regarded this cause as sufficient in a few cases to raise the summits of submerged volcanoes or other mountains to a level at which reef-forming corals can commence to flourish . But he did not think that the admission that under certain favourable conditions , atolls might be thus formed without subsidence , necessitated an abandonment of his theory in the case of the innumerable examples of the kind which stud the Indian and Pacific Oceans . Before publishing my book , I thought long over the same view , but only as far as ordinary marine organisms are concerned , for at that time little was known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms . I rejected this view , as from the few dredgings made in the `` Beagle '' , in the south temperate regions , I concluded that shells , the smaller corals , etc. , decayed and were dissolved when not protected by the deposition of sediment , and sediment could not accumulate in the open ocean . Certainly , shells , etc. , were in several cases completely rotten , and crumbled into mud between my fingers ; but you will know whether this is in any degree common . I have expressly said that a bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll , which could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence . I can , however , hardly believe in the existence of as many banks ( there having been no subsidence ) as there are atolls in the great oceans , within a reasonable depth , on which minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the depth of many hundred feet . '' `` If I am wrong , the sooner I am knocked on the head and annihilated so much the better . It still seems to me a marvellous thing that there should not have been much , and long-continued , subsidence in the beds of the great oceans . I wish some doubly rich millionaire would take it into his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific and Indian atolls , and bring home cores for slicing from a depth of 500 or 600 feet . '' During the last five years , the whole question of the origin of coral-reefs and islands has been re-opened , and a controversy has arisen , into which , unfortunately , acrimonious elements have been very unnecessarily introduced . Those who desire it , will find clear and impartial statements of the varied and often mutually destructive views put forward by different authors , in three works which have made their appearance within the last year , -- '' The Bermuda Islands , '' by Professor Angelo Heilprin ; `` Corals and Coral-Islands , '' new edition by Professor J.D . Bonney . JOHN W. JUDD . CORAL-REEFS . INTRODUCTION . The object of this volume is to describe from my own observation and the works of others , the principal kinds of coral-reefs , more especially those occurring in the open ocean , and to explain the origin of their peculiar forms . I do not here treat of the polypifers , which construct these vast works , except so far as relates to their distribution , and to the conditions favourable to their vigorous growth . Without any distinct intention to classify coral-reefs , most voyagers have spoken of them under the following heads : `` lagoon-islands , '' or `` atolls , '' `` barrier '' or '' encircling reefs , '' and `` fringing '' or `` shore-reefs . '' The lagoon-islands have received much the most attention ; and it is not surprising , for every one must be struck with astonishment , when he first beholds one of these vast rings of coral-rock , often many leagues in diameter , here and there surmounted by a low verdant island with dazzling white shores , bathed on the outside by the foaming breakers of the ocean , and on the inside surrounding a calm expanse of water , which from reflection , is of a bright but pale green colour . The naturalist will feel this astonishment more deeply after having examined the soft and almost gelatinous bodies of these apparently insignificant creatures , and when he knows that the solid reef increases only on the outer edge , which day and night is lashed by the breakers of an ocean never at rest . Well did Francois Pyrard de Laval , in the year 1605 , exclaim , `` C'est une merueille de voir chacun de ces atollons , enuironne d'un grand banc de pierre tout autour , n ' y ayant point d'artifice humain . '' The accompanying sketch of Whitsunday island , in the South Pacific , taken from Captain Beechey 's admirable `` Voyage , '' although excellent of its kind , gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of one of these lagoon-islands . ( PLATE : UNTITLED WOODCUT , WHITSUNDAY ATOLL . ) Whitsunday Island is of small size , and the whole circle has been converted into land , which is a comparatively rare circumstance . As the reef of a lagoon-island generally supports many separate small islands , the word '' island , '' applied to the whole , is often the cause of confusion ; hence I have invariably used in this volume the term `` atoll , '' which is the name given to these circular groups of coral-islets by their inhabitants in the Indian Ocean , and is synonymous with `` lagoon-island . '' ( PLATE : UNTITLED WOODCUT , REEF AT BOLABOLA ISLAND . ) Barrier-reefs , when encircling small islands , have been comparatively little noticed by voyagers ; but they well deserve attention . In their structure they are little less marvellous than atolls , and they give a singular and most picturesque character to the scenery of the islands they surround . In the accompanying sketch , taken from the `` Voyage of the 'Coquille ' , '' the reef is seen from within , from one of the high peaks of the island of Bolabola . ( I have taken the liberty of simplifying the foreground , and leaving out a mountainous island in the far distance . ) Here , as in Whitsunday Island , the whole of that part of the reef which is visible is converted into land . This is a circumstance of rare occurrence ; more usually a snow-white line of great breakers , with here and there an islet crowned by cocoa-nut trees , separates the smooth waters of the lagoon-like channel from the waves of the open sea . The barrier-reefs of Australia and of New Caledonia , owing to their enormous dimensions , have excited much attention : in structure and form they resemble those encircling many of the smaller islands in the Pacific Ocean . With respect to fringing , or shore-reefs , there is little in their structure which needs explanation ; and their name expresses their comparatively small extension . They differ from barrier-reefs in not lying so far from the shore , and in not having within a broad channel of deep water . Reefs also occur around submerged banks of sediment and of worn-down rock ; and others are scattered quite irregularly where the sea is very shallow ; these in most respects are allied to those of the fringing class , but they are of comparatively little interest . I have given a separate chapter to each of the above classes , and have described some one reef or island , on which I possessed most information , as typical ; and have afterwards compared it with others of a like kind . Although this classification is useful from being obvious , and from including most of the coral-reefs existing in the open sea , it admits of a more fundamental division into barrier and atoll-formed reefs on the one hand , where there is a great apparent difficulty with respect to the foundation on which they must first have grown ; and into fringing-reefs on the other , where , owing to the nature of the slope of the adjoining land , there is no such difficulty . The two blue tints and the red colour ( replaced by numbers in this edition . ) on the map ( Plate III . ) , represent this main division , as explained in the beginning of the last chapter . In the Appendix , every existing coral-reef , except some on the coast of Brazil not included in the map , is briefly described in geographical order , as far as I possessed information ; and any particular spot may be found by consulting the Index . Several theories have been advanced to explain the origin of atolls or lagoon-islands , but scarcely one to account for barrier-reefs . From the limited depths at which reef-building polypifers can flourish , taken into consideration with certain other circumstances , we are compelled to conclude , as it will be seen , that both in atolls and barrier-reefs , the foundation on which the coral was primarily attached , has subsided ; and that during this downward movement , the reefs have grown upwards . This conclusion , it will be further seen , explains most satisfactorily the outline and general form of atolls and barrier-reefs , and likewise certain peculiarities in their structure . The distribution , also , of the different kinds of coral-reefs , and their position with relation to the areas of recent elevation , and to the points subject to volcanic eruptions , fully accord with this theory of their origin . ( A brief account of my views on coral formations , now published in my Journal of Researches , was read May 31st , 1837 , before the Geological Society , and an abstract has appeared in the Proceedings . ) ( DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES . PLATE I. -- MAP SHOWING THE RESEMBLANCE IN FORM BETWEEN BARRIER CORAL-REEFS SURROUNDING MOUNTAINOUS ISLANDS , AND ATOLLS OR LAGOON ISLANDS . ) In the several original surveys , from which the small plans on this plate have been reduced , the coral-reefs are engraved in very different styles . For the sake of uniformity , I have adopted the style used in the charts of the Chagos Archipelago , published by the East Indian Company , from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell . The surface of the reef , which dries at low water , is represented by a surface with small crosses : the coral-islets on the reef are marked by small linear spaces , on which a few cocoa-nut trees , out of all proportion too large , have been introduced for the sake of clearness . The entire ANNULAR REEF , which when surrounding an open expanse of water , forms an `` atoll , '' and when surrounding one or more high islands , forms an encircling `` barrier-reef , '' has a nearly uniform structure . The reefs in some of the original surveys are represented merely by a single line with crosses , so that their breadth is not given ; I have had such reefs engraved of the width usually attained by coral-reefs . I have not thought it worth while to introduce all those small and very numerous reefs , which occur within the lagoons of most atolls and within the lagoon-channels of most barrier-reefs , and which stand either isolated , or are attached to the shores of the reef or land . At Peros Banhos none of the lagoon-reefs rise to the surface of the water ; a few of them have been introduced , and are marked by plain dotted circles . A few of the deepest soundings are laid down within each reef ; they are in fathoms , of six English feet . Figure 1. -- VANIKORO , situated in the western part of the South Pacific ; taken from the survey by Captain D'Urville in the `` Astrolabe ; '' the soundings on the southern side of the island , namely , from thirty to forty fathoms , are given from the voyage of the Chev . Dillon ; the other soundings are laid down from the survey by D'Urville ; height of the summit of the island is 3,032 feet . The principal small detached reefs within the lagoon-channel have in this instance been represented . The southern shore of the island is narrowly fringed by a reef : if the engraver had carried this reef entirely round both islands , this figure would have served ( by leaving out in imagination the barrier-reef ) as a good specimen of an abruptly-sided island , surrounded by a reef of the fringing class .

From this station he could not notice the absence of Allen , and he accordingly bawled out as if to him , repeating the orders of the mate . Peters cried out , `` Ay , ay , '' in a disguised voice , and the cook immediately went below , without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right . My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin , Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it . The mate received them with feigned cordiality , and told Augustus that , since he had behaved himself so well of late , he might take up his quarters in the cabin , and be one of them for the future . He then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum , and made him drink it . All this I saw and heard , for I followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut , and took up my old point of observation . I had brought with me the two pump-handles , one of which I secured near the companion-way , to be ready for use when required . I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within , and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal to me as agreed upon . Presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny , and , by degrees , led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen . I could not make out all that was said , but I could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present . The mate was evidently much agitated , and presently , when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers 's corpse , I thought he was upon the point of swooning . Peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once , as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers . At this the villain absolutely gasped for breath , and turned his head slowly round upon his companions , as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task . No one , however , stirred , and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement . Peters now made me the signal . I immediately threw open the door of the companion-way , and , descending without uttering a syllable , stood erect in the midst of the party . The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration . Usually , in cases of a similar nature , there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes ; a degree of hope , however feeble , that he is the victim of chicanery , and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the world of shadows . It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation , and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about , is to be attributed , even in the cases most in point , and where most suffering has been experienced , more to a kind of anticipative horror , lest the apparition _might possibly be_ real , than to an unwavering belief in its reality . But , in the present instance , it will be seen immediately , that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse , or at least its spiritual image . The isolated situation of the brig , with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale , confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits , that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance . They had now been at sea twenty-four days , without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever . The whole of the crew , too , at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board , were assembled in the cabin , with the exception of Allen , the watch ; and his gigantic stature ( he was six feet six inches high ) was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant . Add to these considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest , and that of the conversation brought about by Peters ; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men ; the excellence of the imitation in my person ; and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me , as the glare of the cabin lantern , swinging violently to and fro , fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure , and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated . The mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying , and , without uttering a syllable , fell back , stone dead , upon the cabin floor , and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig . Of the remaining seven there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind . The four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor , the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered . The only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook , John Hunt , and Richard Parker ; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence . The two former were shot instantly by Peters , and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle which I had brought with me . In the mean time Augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor , and shot another mutineer ( -- -- Wilson ) through the breast . There were now but three remaining ; but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy , and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them , for they fought with great resolution and fury , and , but for the immense muscular strength of Peters , might have ultimately got the better of us . These three men were -- -- Jones , -- -- Greely , and Absalom Hicks . Jones had thrown Augustus on the floor , stabbed him in several places along the right arm , and would no doubt have soon despatched him ( as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists ) , had it not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose assistance we surely had never depended . This friend was no other than Tiger . With a low growl he bounded into the cabin , at a most critical moment for Augustus , and throwing himself upon Jones , pinned him to the floor in an instant . My friend , however , was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever , and I was so encumbered with my disguise that I could do but little . The dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of Jones -- Peters , nevertheless , was far more than a match for the two men who remained , and would , no doubt , have despatched them sooner , had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act , and the tremendous lurches of the vessel . Presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool , several of which lay about the floor . With this he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me , and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with Hicks , he seized him by the throat , and , by dint of sheer strength , strangled him instantaneously . Thus , in far less time than I have taken to tell it , we found ourselves masters of the brig . The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker . This man , it will be remembered , I had knocked down with a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack . He now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom ; but , upon Peters touching him with his foot , he spoke , and entreated for mercy . His head was only slightly cut , and otherwise he had received no injury , having been merely stunned by the blow . He now got up , and , for the present , we secured his hands behind his back . The dog was still growling over Jones ; but , upon examination , we found him completely dead , the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat , inflicted , no doubt , by the sharp teeth of the animal . It was now about one o'clock in the morning , and the wind was still blowing tremendously . The brig evidently laboured much more than usual , and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of easing her in some measure . At almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea , several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle , the hatchway having been left open by myself when I descended . The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away , as well as the caboose , together with the jollyboat from the counter . The creaking and working of the mainmast , too , gave indication that it was nearly sprung . To make room for more stowage in the after hold , the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks ( a very reprehensible practice , occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders ) , so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step . But , to crown all our difficulties , we plummed the well , and found no less than seven feet water . Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin , we got to work immediately at the pumps -- Parker , of course , being set at liberty to assist us in the labour . Augustus 's arm was bound up as well as we could effect it , and he did what he could , but that was not much . However , we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going . As there were only four of us , this was severe labour ; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits , and looked anxiously for daybreak , when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast . In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue , and , when the day at length broke , the gale had neither abated in the least , nor were there any signs of its abating . We now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard . Our next care was to get rid of the mainmast . The necessary preparations having been made , Peters cut away at the mast ( having found axes in the cabin ) , while the rest of us stood by the stays and lanyards . As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch , the word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards , which being done , the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea , clear of the brig , and without doing any material injury . We now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before , but our situation was still exceedingly precarious , and , in spite of the utmost exertions , we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps . The little assistance which Augustus could render us was not really of any importance . To add to our distress , a heavy sea , striking the brig to windward , threw her off several points from the wind , and , before she could regain her position , another broke completely over her , and hurled her full upon her beam-ends . The ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward ( the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some time ) , and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from capsizing . Presently , however , we partially righted ; but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard , we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps , which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case , as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone , and were bleeding in the most horrible manner . Contrary to Parker 's advice , we now proceeded to cut away the foremast , and at length accomplished it after much difficulty , owing to the position in which we lay . In going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit , and left us a complete hulk . So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat , which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board . But we had not long to congratulate ourselves ; for the foremast having gone , and , of course , the foresail with it , by which the brig had been steadied , every sea now made a complete breach over us , and in five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern , the longboat and starboard bulwarks torn off , and even the windlass shattered into fragments . It was , indeed , hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition . At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale's abating , but in this we were sadly disappointed , for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury . About four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast ; and , as the night closed in upon us , I had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together until morning . By midnight we had settled very deep in the water , which was now up to the orlop deck . The rudder went soon afterward , the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water , against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore . We had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last , as it was unusually strong , being rigged as I have never seen one rigged either before or since . Down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks , and others in the same manner down the stern-post . Through these hooks there extended a very thick wrought-iron rod , the rudder being thus held to the stern-post , and swinging freely on the rod . The tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact , that the hooks in the stern-post , which ran entirely through it , being clinched on the inside , were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood . We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock , when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right on board of us , sweeping the companion-way clear off , bursting in the hatchways , and filling every inch of the vessel with water . CHAPTER IX . Luckily , just before night , all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass , lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible . This precaution alone saved us from destruction . As it was , we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us , and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted . As soon as I could recover breath , I called aloud to my companions . Augustus alone replied , saying , `` It is all over with us , and may God have mercy upon our souls . '' By-and-by both the others were enabled to speak , when they exhorted us to take courage , as there was still hope ; it being impossible , from the nature of the cargo , that the brig could go down , and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the morning . These words inspired me with new life ; for , strange as it may seem , although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink , I had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether ; and the danger which I had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering . As hope revived within me , I made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass , and in this occupation I soon discovered that my companions were also busy . The night was as dark as it could possibly be , and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing . Our deck lay level with the sea , or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam , a portion of which swept over us every instant . It is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of water more than one second in three . Although we lay close together , no one of us could see the other , or , indeed , any portion of the brig itself , upon which we were so tempestuously hurled about . At intervals we called one to the other , thus endeavouring to keep alive hope , and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it . The feeble condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all ; and as , from the lacerated condition of his right arm , it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness , we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard -- yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question . Fortunately , his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us ; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass , the seas , as they tumbled in upon him , were greatly broken in their violence . In any other situation than this ( into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot ) he must inevitably have perished before morning . Owing to the brig 's lying so much along , we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case . The heel , as I have before stated , was to larboard , about one half of the deck being constantly under water . The seas , therefore , which struck us to starboard were much broken by the vessel 's side , only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces ; while those which came from larboard , being what are called back-water seas , and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture , had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings . In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us . The brig was a mere log , rolling about at the mercy of every wave ; the gale was upon the increase , if anything , blowing indeed a complete hurricane , and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance . For several hours we held on in silence , expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way , that the remains of the windlass would go by the board , or that some of the huge seas , which roared in every direction around us and above us , would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface . By the mercy of God , however , we were preserved from these imminent dangers , and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun . Shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind , when , now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before , Augustus spoke , asking Peters , who lay closest to him , if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved . As no reply was at first made to this question , we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay ; but presently , to our great joy , he spoke , although very feebly , saying that he was in great pain , being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach , that he must either find means of loosening them or perish , as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer . This occasioned us great distress , as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did . We exhorted him to bear his sufferings with fortitude , and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him . He replied that it would soon be too late ; that it would be all over with him before we could help him ; and then , after moaning for some minutes , lay silent , when we concluded that he had perished . As the evening drew on , the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes , and the wind had abated a great deal , although still blowing a severe gale . I had not heard any of my companions speak for hours , and now called to Augustus . He replied , although very feebly , so that I could not distinguish what he said . I then spoke to Peters and to Parker , neither of whom returned any answer . Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial insensibility , during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination ; such as green trees , waving meadows of ripe grain , processions of dancing girls , troops of cavalry , and other phantasies . I now remember that , in all which passed before my mind 's eye , _motion_ was a predominant idea . Thus , I never fancied any stationary object , such as a house , a mountain , or anything of that kind ; but windmills , ships , large birds , balloons , people on horseback , carriages driving furiously , and similar moving objects , presented themselves in endless succession . When I recovered from this state , the sun was , as near as I could guess , an hour high . I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation , and for some time remained firmly convinced that I was still in the hold of the brig , near the box , and that the body of Parker was that of Tiger . When I at length completely came to my senses , I found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze , and that the sea was comparatively calm ; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships . My left arm had broken loose from its lashings , and was much cut about the elbow ; my right was entirely benumbed , and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope , which had worked from the shoulder downward . I was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist , and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness . Looking round upon my companions , I saw that Peters still lived , although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two ; as I stirred , he made a feeble motion to me with his hand , pointing to the rope . Augustus gave no indication of life whatever , and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass . Parker spoke to me when he saw me moving , and asked me if I had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation ; saying , that if I would summon up what spirits I could , and contrive to untie him , we might yet save our lives ; but that otherwise we must all perish . I told him to take courage , and I would endeavour to free him . Feeling in my pantaloons ' pocket , I got hold of my penknife , and , after several ineffectual attempts , at length succeeded in opening it . I then , with my left hand , managed to free my right from its fastenings , and afterward cut the other ropes which held me . Upon attempting , however , to move from my position , I found that my legs failed me altogether , and that I could not get up ; neither could I move my right arm in any direction . Upon mentioning this to Parker , he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes , holding on to the windlass with my left hand , so as to allow time for the blood to circulate . Doing this , the numbness presently began to die away , so that I could move first one of my legs , and then the other ; and , shortly afterward , I regained the partial use of my right arm . I now crawled with great caution towards Parker , without getting on my legs , and soon cut loose all the lashings about him , when , after a short delay , he also recovered the partial use of his limbs . We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from Peters . It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons , and through two shirts , and made its way into his groin , from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage . No sooner had we removed it , however , than he spoke , and seemed to experience instant relief -- being able to move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself -- this was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood . We had little hope that Augustus would recover , as he evinced no signs of life ; but , upon getting to him , we discovered that he had merely swooned from loss of blood , the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water ; none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death . Having relieved him from the fastenings , and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass , we secured him in a dry place to windward , with his head somewhat lower than his body , and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs . In about half an hour he came to himself , although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognising any of us , or had sufficient strength to speak . By the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark , and it began to cloud up , so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard , in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing , exhausted as we were . By good fortune it continued very moderate during the night , the sea subsiding every minute , which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation . A gentle breeze still blew from the N. W. , but the weather was not at all cold . Augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel , as he was still too weak to hold on at all . For ourselves there was no such necessity . We sat close together , supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass , and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation . We derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them . When we put them on after this , they felt remarkably warm and pleasant , and served to invigorate us in no little degree . We helped Augustus off with his , and wrung them for him , when he experienced the same comfort . Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst , and , when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect , our hearts sunk within us , and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea . We endeavoured , however , to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel , and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen . The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned , and the weather still continued clear and pleasant , with a steady but very light breeze from the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth , and as , from some cause which we could not determine , the brig did not lie so much along as she had done before , the deck was comparatively dry , and we could move about with freedom . We had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink , and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below . As the brig was completely full of water , we went to this work despondingly , and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything . We made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood . Tying these across each other , and fastening them to the end of a rope , we threw them into the cabin , and dragged them to and fro , in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food , or which might at least render us assistance in getting it . We spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect , fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes , which were readily caught by the nails . Indeed , our contrivance was so very clumsy , that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated . We now tried the forecastle , but equally in vain , and were upon the brink of despair , when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body , and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin . This proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire . He proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons ; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle , being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping . The undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger ; for , as we could hardly expect to find much , if any provision in the cabin itself , it was necessary that the diver , after letting himself down , should make a turn to the right , and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet , in a narrow passage , to the storeroom , and return , without drawing breath . Everything being ready , Peters now descended into the cabin , going down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin . He then plunged in , head first , turning to the right as he plunged , and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom . In this first attempt , however , he was altogether unsuccessful . In less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently ( the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn up ) . We accordingly drew him up instantly , but so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder . He had brought nothing with him , and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage , owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck . Upon getting out he was very much exhausted , and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend . The second attempt met with even worse success ; for he remained so long under water without giving the signal , that , becoming alarmed for his safety , we drew him out without it , and found that he was almost at the last gasp , having , as he said , repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it . This was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder . This balustrade was , indeed , so much in the way , that we determined to remove it , if possible , before proceeding with our design . As we had no means of getting it away except by main force , we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder , and , giving a pull against it with our united strength , succeeded in breaking it down . The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first , and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself , and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search . For a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose ; but at length , to our great joy , we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off . Having fastened this securely to one of his ancles , Peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin , and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward 's room . To his inexpressible grief , however , he found it locked , and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance , as , with the greatest exertion , he could remain under water not more , at the utmost extent , than a single minute . Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed , and neither Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears , as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us , and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape . But this weakness was not of long duration . Throwing ourselves on our knees to God , we implored his aid in the many dangers which beset us ; and arose with renewed hope and vigour to think what could yet be done by mortal means towards accomplishing our deliverance . CHAPTER X . Shortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion , as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror , than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years , crowded with events of the most startling , and , in many cases , of the most unconceived and unconceivable character . We were lying on the deck near the companion-way , and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom , when , looking towards Augustus , who lay fronting myself , I perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale , and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner . Greatly alarmed , I spoke to him , but he made me no reply , and I was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill , when I took notice of his eyes , which were glaring apparently at some object behind me . I turned my head , and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame , when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us , and not more than a couple of miles off . I sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart ; and , stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel , stood in this manner , motionless , and unable to articulate a syllable . Peters and Parker were equally affected , although in different ways . The former danced about the deck like a madman , uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades , intermingled with howls and imprecations , while the latter burst into tears , and continued for many minutes weeping like a child . The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig , of a Dutch build , and painted black , with a tawdry gilt figurehead . She had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather , and , we supposed , had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves ; for her foretopmast was gone , and some of her starboard bulwarks . When we first saw her , she was , as I have already said , about two miles off and to windward , bearing down upon us . The breeze was very gentle , and what astonished us chiefly was , that she had no other sails set than her foresail and mainsail , with a flying jib -- of course she came down but slowly , and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy . The awkward manner in which she steered , too , was remarked by all of us , even excited as we were . She yawed about so considerably , that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us , or imagined that , having seen us , and discovered no person on board , she was about to tack and make off in another direction . Upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices , when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention , and again hold on towards us -- this singular conduct being repeated two or three times , so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor . No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us . We then saw three seamen , whom by their dress we took to be Hollanders . Two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle , and the third , who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity , was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit . This last was a stout and tall man , with a very dark skin . He seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience , nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way , and smiling constantly so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth . As his vessel drew nearer , we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water ; but of this he took little or no notice , continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations . I relate these things and circumstances minutely , and I relate them , it must be understood , precisely as they _appeared_ to us . The brig came on slowly , and now more steadily than before , and -- I can not speak calmly of this event -- our hearts leaped up wildly within us , and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to God for the complete , unexpected , and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand . Of a sudden , and all at once , there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel ( which was now close upon us ) a smell , a stench , such as the whole world has no name for -- no conception of -- hellish -- utterly suffocating -- insufferable , inconceivable . I gasped for breath , and , turning to my companions , perceived that they were paler than marble . But we had now no time left for question or surmise -- the brig was within fifty feet of us , and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter , that we might board her without her putting out a boat . We rushed aft , when , suddenly , a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running , and , as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet , we had a full view of her decks . Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle ? Twenty-five or thirty human bodies , among whom were several females , lay scattered about between the counter and the galley , in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction ! We plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel ! Yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help ! Yes , long and loudly did we beg , in the agony of the moment , that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us , would not abandon us to become like them , would receive us among their goodly company ! We were raving with horror and despair -- thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment . As our first loud yell of terror broke forth , it was replied to by something , from near the bowsprit of the stranger , so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived . At this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view , and we beheld at once the origin of the sound . We saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark , and still nodding his head to and fro , but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it . His arms were extended over the rail , and the palms of his hands fell outward . His knees were lodged upon a stout rope , tightly stretched , and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead . On his back , from which a portion of the shirt had been torn , leaving it bare , there sat a huge seagull , busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh , its bill and talons deep buried , and its white plumage spattered all over with blood . As the brig moved further round so as to bring us close in view , the bird , with much apparent difficulty , drew out its crimsoned head , and , after eying us for a moment as if stupified , arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting , and , flying directly above our deck , hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak . The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of Parker . May God forgive me , but now , for the first time , there flashed through my mind a thought , a thought which I will not mention , and I felt myself making a step towards the ensanguined spot . I looked upward , and the eyes of Augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses . I sprang forward quickly , and , with a deep shudder , threw the frightful thing into the sea . The body from which it had been taken , resting as it did upon the rope , had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird , and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive . As the gull relieved it of its weight , it swung round and fell partially over , so that the face was fully discovered . Never , surely , was any object so terribly full of awe ! The eyes were gone , and the whole flesh around the mouth , leaving the teeth utterly naked . This , then , was the smile which had cheered us on to hope ! this the -- but I forbear . The brig , as I have already told , passed under our stern , and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward . With her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy . Deliberately as she went by , we might possibly have found means of boarding her , had not our sudden disappointment , and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it , laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body . We had seen and felt , but we could neither think nor act , until , alas , too late . How much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact , that , when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull , the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming ! I have , since this period , vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger . Her build and general appearance , as I have before stated , led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader , and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion . We might have easily seen the name upon her stern , and , indeed , taken other observations which would have guided us in making out her character ; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to everything of that nature . From the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed , we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever , or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind . If such were the case ( and I know not what else to imagine ) , death , to judge from the positions of the bodies , must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming , in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted . It is possible , indeed , that poison , accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores , may have brought about the disaster ; or that the eating some unknown venomous species of fish , or other marine animal , or oceanic bird , might have induced it -- but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved , and will , no doubt , remain for ever involved , in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery . CHAPTER XI . We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy , gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness , hiding her from our sight , recalled us in some measure to our senses . The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned , absorbing all other cares and considerations . Nothing , however , could be done until the morning , and , securing ourselves as well as possible , we endeavoured to snatch a little repose . In this I succeeded beyond my expectation , sleeping until my companions , who had not been so fortunate , aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provision from the hull . It was now a dead calm , with the sea as smooth as I have ever known it -- the weather warm and pleasant . The brig was out of sight . We commenced our operations by wrenching off , with some trouble , another of the forechains ; and having fastened both to Peters 's feet , he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom , thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open , provided he could get at it in sufficient time ; and this he hoped to do , as the hulk lay much more steadily than before . He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door , when , loosening one of the chains from his ankle , he made every exertion to force a passage with it , but in vain , the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated . He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water , and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place . For this service Parker immediately volunteered ; but , after making three ineffectual efforts , found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door . The condition of Augustus 's wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down , as he would be unable to force the room open should he reach it , and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance . Peters had left one of the chains in the passage , and I found , upon plunging in , that I had not sufficient ballast to keep me firmly down . I determined , therefore , to attempt no more , in my first effort , than merely to recover the other chain . In groping along the floor of the passage for this I felt a hard substance , which I immediately grasped , not having time to ascertain what it was , but returning and ascending instantly to the surface . The prize proved to be a bottle , and our joy may be conceived when I say that it was found to be full of Port wine . Giving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance , we immediately drew the cork with my penknife , and , each taking a moderate sup , felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth , strength , and spirits with which it inspired us . We then carefully recorked the bottle , and , by means of a handkerchief , swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken . Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery , I again descended , and now recovered the chain , with which I instantly came up . I then fastened it on and went down for the third time , when I became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever , in that situation , would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom . I therefore returned in despair . There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope , and I could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish . The wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium , which , perhaps , I had been prevented from feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it . They talked incoherently , and about matters unconnected with our condition , Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket . Augustus , too , I remember , approached me with a serious air , and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb , as his hair was full of fish scales , and he wished to get them out before going on shore . Parker appeared somewhat less affected , and urged me to dive at random into the cabin , and bring up any article which might come to hand . To this I consented , and , in the first attempt , after staying under a full minute , brought up a small leather trunk belonging to Captain Barnard . This was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink . We found nothing , however , except a box of razors and two linen shirts . I now went down again , and returned without any success . As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck , and , upon getting up , saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine , having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before I saw them . I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct , when Augustus burst into tears . The other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke , but I hope never again to behold laughter of such a species : the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful . Indeed , it was apparent that the stimulus , in the empty state of their stomachs , had taken instant and violent effect , and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated . With great difficulty I prevailed upon them to lie down , when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber , accompanied with loud stertorous breathing . I now found myself , as it were , alone in the brig , and my reflections , to be sure , were of the most fearful and gloomy nature . No prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine , or , at the best , by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up , for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another . The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly insupportable , and I felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it . With my knife I cut off a small portion of the leather trunk , and endeavoured to eat it , but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel , although I fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out . Towards night my companions awoke , one by one , each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror , brought on by the wine , whose fumes had now evaporated . They shook as if with a violent ague , and uttered the most lamentable cries for water . Their condition affected me in the most lively degree , at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine , and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations . Their conduct , however , gave me great uneasiness and alarm ; for it was evident that , unless some favourable change took place , they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety . I had not yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from below ; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while I went down . Parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others , and I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to arouse him . Thinking that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial effect , I contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body , and then , leading him to the companion-way ( he remaining quite passive all the while ) , pushed him in , and immediately drew him out . I had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment ; for he appeared much revived and invigorated , and , upon getting out , asked me , in a rational manner , why I had so served him . Having explained my object , he expressed himself indebted to me , and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion , afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation . We then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way , which we immediately did , when they both experienced much benefit from the shock . This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania à potu_ . Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope , I again made three or four plunges into the cabin , although it was now quite dark , and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady . In the course of these attempts I succeeded in bringing up two case-knives , a three-gallon jug , empty , and a blanket , but nothing which could serve us for food . I continued my efforts , after getting these articles , until I was completely exhausted , but brought up nothing else . During the night Parker and Peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner ; but nothing coming to hand , we now gave up this attempt in despair , concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain . We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined . The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned , and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief , but to no purpose . The sea was still smooth , with only a long swell from the northward , as on yesterday . This was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink , with the exception of the bottle of Port wine , and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained . I never saw before , nor wish to see again , human beings so utterly emaciated as Peters and Augustus . Had I met them on shore in their present condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld them . Their countenances were totally changed in character , so that I could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a few days before . Parker , although sadly reduced , and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom , was not so far gone as the other two . He suffered with great patience , making no complaint , and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise . For myself , although at the commencement of the voyage I had been in bad health , and was at all times of a delicate constitution , I suffered less than any of us , being much less reduced in frame , and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree , while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect , and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood , generally simpering in their expressions , with idiotic smiles , and uttering the most absurd platitudes . At intervals , however , they would appear to revive suddenly , as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition , when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour , and speak , for a short period , of their prospects , in a manner altogether rational , although full of the most intense despair . It is possible , however , that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as I did of mine , and that I may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves -- this is a matter which can not be determined . About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter , and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming towards it . Peters and Augustus took little notice of what he said , being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation . Upon looking in the direction pointed out I could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore -- indeed , I was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature . It was a long time , nevertheless , before I could convince Parker of his mistake . He then burst into a flood of tears , weeping like a child , with loud cries and sobs , for two or three hours , when , becoming exhausted , he fell asleep . Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather . I advised them to chew it and spit it out ; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice . I continued to chew pieces of it at intervals , and found some relief from so doing ; my chief distress was for water , and I was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves . The day wore on in this manner , when I suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward , and on our larboard bow . She appeared to be a large ship , and was coming nearly athwart us , being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant . None of my companions had as yet discovered her , and I forbore to tell them of her for the present , lest we might again be disappointed of relief . At length , upon her getting nearer , I saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us , with her light sails filled . I could now contain myself no longer , and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers . They immediately sprang to their feet , again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy , weeping , laughing in an idiotic manner , jumping , stamping upon the deck , tearing their hair , and praying and cursing by turns . I was so affected by their conduct , as well as by what I now considered a sure prospect of deliverance , that I could not refrain from joining in with their madness , and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck , clapping my hands , shouting , and other similar acts , until I was suddenly called to my recollection , and once more to the extreme of human misery and despair , by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented towards us , and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which I had at first perceived her . It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place . They replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations . The conduct of Augustus most sensibly affected me . In spite of all I could say or do to the contrary , he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us , and in making preparations to go on board of her . Some seaweed floating by the brig , he maintained that it was the ship's boat , and endeavoured to throw himself upon it , howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner , when I forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea . Having become in some degree pacified , we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her , the weather becoming hazy , with a light breeze springing up . As soon as she was entirely gone , Parker turned suddenly towards me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder . There was about him an air of self-possession which I had not noticed in him until now , and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say . He proposed , in a few words , that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others . CHAPTER XII . I had , for some time past , dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity , and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course . Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which I laboured . The proposition had not been heard by either Peters or Augustus . I therefore took Parker aside ; and mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained , I expostulated with him for a long time and in the most supplicating manner , begging him in the name of everything which he held sacred , and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested , to abandon the idea , and not to mention it to either of the other two . He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments , and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as I desired . But when I had ceased speaking , he said that he knew very well all I had said was true , and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man ; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained ; that it was unnecessary for all to perish , when , by the death of one , it was possible , and even probable , that the rest might be finally preserved ; adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose , his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship , and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period . I now begged him , if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design , at least to defer it for another day , when some vessel might come to our relief ; again reiterating every argument I could devise , and which I thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature . He said , in reply , that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment ; that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind ; and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late , as regarded himself at least . Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a mild tone , I now assumed a different demeanour , and told him that he must be aware I had suffered less than any of us from our calamities ; that my health and strength , consequently , were at that moment far better than his own , or than that either of Peters or Augustus ; in short , that I was in a condition to have my own way by force if I found it necessary ; and that , if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs , I would not hesitate to throw him into the sea . Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat , and drawing a knife , made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach ; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing . In the mean time , being roused to a high pitch of anger , I forced him to the vessel 's side , with the full intention of throwing him overboard . He was saved from this fate , however , by the interference of Peters , who now approached and separated us , asking the cause of the disturbance . This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to prevent him . The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had anticipated . Both Augustus and Peters , who , it seems , had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the first to broach , joined with him in his design , and insisted upon its being immediately carried into effect . I had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose ; and , with the aid of either one of them , I had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment . Being disappointed in this expectation , it became absolutely necessary that I should attend to my own safety , as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I knew would speedily be enacted . I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal , merely requesting a delay of about one hour , in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting , when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight . After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to wait thus long ; and , as I had anticipated ( a breeze rapidly coming in ) , the fog lifted before the hour had expired , when , no vessel appearing in sight , we prepared to draw lots . It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued ; a scene which , with its minutest details , no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory , and whose stern recollection will imbitter every future moment of my existence . Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit . The only method we could devise for the terrific lottery , in which we were to take each a chance , was that of drawing straws . Small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose , and it was agreed that I should be the holder . I retired to one end of the hulk , while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned towards me . The bitterest anxiety which I endured at any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots . There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence ; an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held . But now that the silent , definite , and stern nature of the business in which I was engaged ( so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine ) allowed me to reflect on the few chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths -- a death for the most appalling of purposes -- every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind , leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror . I could not , at first , even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood , my fingers absolutely refusing their office , and my knees knocking violently against each other . My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation . I thought of falling on my knees to my companions , and entreating them to let me escape this necessity ; of suddenly rushing upon them , and , by putting one of them to death , of rendering the decision by lot useless -- in short , of everything but of going through with the matter I had in hand . At last , after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct , I was recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker , who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring . Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot , but thought over every species of finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw , as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest . Before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness , let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own . At length delay was no longer possible , and , with a heart almost bursting from my bosom , I advanced to the region of the forecastle , where my companions were awaiting me . I held out my hand with the splinters , and Peters immediately drew . He was free -- _his_ , at least , was not the shortest ; and there was now another chance against my escape . I summoned up all my strength , and passed the lots to Augustus . He also drew immediately , and he also was free ; and now , whether I should live or die , the chances were no more than precisely even . At this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom , and I felt towards my poor fellow-creature , Parker , the most intense , the most diabolical hatred . But the feeling did not last ; and , at length , with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes , I held out the two remaining splinters towards him . It was full five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw , during which period of heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes . Presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand . The decision was then over , yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me . No one spoke , and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter I held . Peters at length took me by the hand , and I forced myself to look up , when I immediately saw by the countenance of Parker that I was safe , and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer . Gasping for breath , I fell senseless to the deck . I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about . He made no resistance whatever , and was stabbed in the back by Peters , when he fell instantly dead . I must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued . Such things may be imagined , but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality . Let it suffice to say that , having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim , and having by common consent taken off the hands , feet , and head , throwing them , together with the entrails , into the sea , we devoured the rest of the body , piecemeal , during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth , eighteenth , nineteenth , and twentieth of the month . On the nineteenth , there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes , we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale . The quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon ; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope . On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity . The weather still remained warm and pleasant , with occasional fogs and light breezes , most usually from N. to W. On the twenty-second , as we were sitting close huddled together , gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition , there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope . I remembered that , when the foremast had been cut away , Peters , being in the windward chains , passed one of the axes into my hand , requesting me to put it , if possible , in a place of security , and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe into the forecastle , and laid it in one of the larboard berths . I now thought it possible that , by getting at this axe , we might cut through the deck over the storeroom , and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions . When I communicated this project to my companions , they uttered a feeble shout of joy , and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle . The difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin , the opening being much smaller , for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried away , whereas the forecastle-way , being a simple hatch of only about three feet square , had remained uninjured . I did not hesitate , however , to attempt the descent ; and , a rope being fastened round my body as before , I plunged boldly in , feet foremost , made my way quickly to the berth , and , at the very first attempt , brought up the axe . It was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph , and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation . We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope , Peters and myself taking the axe by turns , Augustus 's wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree . As we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported , and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting , it soon became evident that many long hours would be requisite to accomplish our task -- that is , to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom . This consideration , however , did not discourage us ; and , working all night by the light of the moon , we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third . Peters now volunteered to go down ; and , having made all arrangements as before , he descended , and soon returned , bringing up with him a small jar , which , to our great joy , proved to be full of olives . Having shared these among us , and devoured them with the greatest avidity , we proceeded to let him down again . This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations , returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine . Of the latter we each took a moderate sup , having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely . The ham , except about two pounds near the bone , was not in a condition to be eaten , having been entirely spoiled by the salt water . The sound part was divided among us . Peters and Augustus , not being able to restrain their appetite , swallowed theirs upon the instant ; but I was more cautious , and ate but a small portion of mine , dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue . We now rested a while from our labours , which had been intolerably severe . By noon , feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed , we again renewed our attempt at getting up provision , Peters and myself going down alternately , and always with more or less success , until sundown . During this interval we had the good fortune to bring up , altogether , four more small jars of olives , another ham , a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine , and , what gave us still more delight , a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed , several of which had been taken on board by Captain Barnard , as the Grampus was leaving port , from the schooner Mary Pitts , just returned from a sealing voyage in the Pacific . In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise . It is found principally , as most of my readers may know , in the group of islands called the Gallipagos , which , indeed , derive their name from the animal -- the Spanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water terapin . From the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise . They are frequently found of an enormous size . I have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds , although I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred . Their appearance is singular , and even disgusting . Their steps are very slow , measured , and heavy , their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground . Their neck is long , and exceedingly slender ; from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length , and I killed one , where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches . The head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent . They can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time , instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind -- being as fat , and , in every respect , in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in . In one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary , or camel of the desert . In a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water . In some instances , upon killing them after a full year 's deprivation of all nourishment , as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags . Their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery , with purslain , sea-kelp , and prickly pears , upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully , a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered . They are excellent and highly nutritious food , and have , no doubt , been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the Pacific . The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size , weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds . It was a female , and in excellent condition , being exceedingly fat , and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag . This was indeed a treasure ; and , falling on our knees with one accord , we returned fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief . We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening , as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious . It was upon the point of making its escape from Peters 's grasp , and slipping back into the water , when Augustus , throwing a rope with a slip-knot around its throat , held it up in this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of Peters , and assisted him in lifting it out . The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug , which , it will be remembered , had been brought up before from the cabin . Having done this , we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form , with the cork , a kind of glass , holding not quite half a gill . We then each drank one of these measures full , and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out . During the last two or three days , the weather having been dry and pleasant , the bedding we had obtained from the cabin , as well as our clothing , had become thoroughly dry , so that we passed this night ( that of the twenty-third ) in comparative comfort , enjoying a tranquil repose , after having supped plentifully on olives and ham , with a small allowance of the wine . Being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night , in the event of a breeze springing up , we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass . Our tortoise , which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could , we threw on his back , and otherwise carefully fastened . CHAPTER XIII . _July 24._ This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength . Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed , ignorant of our position , although certainly at a great distance from land , without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care , almost entirely without water , and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave , on the merest wreck in the world , still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil -- so strictly comparative is either good or ill. At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom , when , a smart shower coming on , with some lightning , we turned our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose . We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle of it . The water , thus conducted to the centre , was drained through into our jug . We had nearly filled it in this manner , when , a heavy squall coming on from the northward , obliged us to desist , as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet . We now went forward , and , lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before , awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated , or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances . At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze , and by night into a stiff gale , accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell . Experience having taught us , however , the best method of arranging our lashings , we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security , although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea , and in momentary dread of being washed off . Fortunately , the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise . _July 25._ This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze , and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck . To our great grief , however , we found that two jars of our olives , as well as the whole of our ham , had been washed overboard , in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened . We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet , and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives , and a measure of water each , which latter we mixed , half and half , with wine , finding great relief and strength from the mixture , without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the Port . The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom . Several articles , of no importance to us in our present situation , floated up through the opening during the day , and were immediately washed overboard . We also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever , so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves . On this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day . At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical , and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator . Towards evening saw several sharks , and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us . At one time , a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water , the monster actually swam in upon us , floundering for some moments just over the companion-hatch , and striking Peters violently with his tail . A heavy sea at length hurled him overboard , much to our relief . In moderate weather we might have easily captured him . _July 26._ This morning , the wind having greatly abated , and the sea not being very rough , we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom . After a great deal of hard labour during the whole day , we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter , the partitions of the room having been stove during the night , and its contents swept into the hold . This discovery , as may be supposed , filled us with despair . _July 27._ The sea nearly smooth , with a light wind , and still from the northward and westward . The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon , we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes . Found great relief from thirst , and much comfort otherwise , by bathing in the sea ; in this , however , we were forced to use great caution , being afraid of sharks , several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day . _July 28._ Good weather still . The brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up . Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency , lashing our tortoise , water-jug , and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward , placing them outside the hull , below the main-chains . The sea very smooth all day , with little or no wind . _July 29._ A continuance of the same weather . Augustus 's wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification . He complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst , but no acute pain . Nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives , and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced . We did everything in our power for his comfort , and trebled his allowance of water . _July 30._ An excessively hot day , with no wind . An enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon . We made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose . Augustus much worse , and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds . He constantly prayed to be released from his sufferings , wishing for nothing but death . This evening we ate the last of our olives , and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine . Determined to kill our tortoise in the morning . _July 31._ After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue , owing to the position of the hulk , we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise . He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed , although in good condition -- the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds . With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible , we cut it into fine pieces , and filled with them our three remaining olive-jars and the wine-bottle ( all of which had been kept ) , pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives . In this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise , intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest . We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day ; the whole would thus last us thirteen days . A brisk shower , with severe thunder and lightning , came on about dusk , but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water . The whole of this , by common consent , was given to Augustus , who now appeared to be in the last extremity . He drank the water from the sheet as we caught it ( we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth ) , for we had now nothing left capable of holding water , unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy , or the stale water from the jug . Either of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted . The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught . His arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder , and his feet were like ice . We expected every moment to see him breathe his last . He was frightfully emaciated ; so much so that , although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket , he now did not weigh more than _forty or fifty at the farthest_ . His eyes were sunk far in his head , being scarcely perceptible , and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food , or even swallowing any liquid , without great difficulty . _August 1._ A continuance of the same calm weather , with an oppressively hot sun . Suffered exceedingly from thirst , the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin . We contrived , nevertheless , to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine -- our thirst , however , was but little abated . We found more relief by bathing in the sea , but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals , on account of the continual presence of sharks . We now saw clearly that Augustus could not be saved ; that he was evidently dying . We could do nothing to relieve his sufferings , which appeared to be great . About twelve o'clock he expired in strong convulsions , and without having spoken for several hours . His death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings , and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day , and never addressed each other except in a whisper . It was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard . It was then loathsome beyond expression , and so far decayed that , as Peters attempted to lift it , an entire leg came off in his grasp . As the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel 's side into the water , the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks , the clashing of whose horrible teeth , as their prey was torn to pieces among them , might have been heard at the distance of a mile . We shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound . _August 2._ The same fearfully calm and hot weather . The dawn found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion . The water in the jug was now absolutely useless , being a thick gelatinous mass ; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime . We threw it out , and washed the jug well in the sea , afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise . Our thirst could now scarcely be endured , and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine , which seemed only to add fuel to the flame , and excited us to a high degree of intoxication . We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater ; but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings , so that we never again attempted it . During the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing , but to no purpose ; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks -- no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before , and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast . This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret , and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings . We had experienced indescribable relief in bathing , and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear . Nor , indeed , were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger , for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of these voracious fish , who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us , swimming up to leeward . No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them . Even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters , and much wounded , he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were . A cloud came up at dusk , but , to our extreme anguish , passed over without discharging itself . It is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period . We passed a sleepless night , both on this account and through dread of the sharks . _August 3._ No prospect of relief , and the brig lying still more and more along , so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all . Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat , so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over . Got out two stout spikes from the forechains , and , by means of the axe , drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water ; this not being very far from the keel , as we were nearly upon our beam-ends . To these spikes we now lashed our provisions , as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains . Suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day -- no chance of bathing on account of the sharks , which never left us for a moment . Found it impossible to sleep . _August 4._ A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling over , and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement . At first the roll was slow and gradual , and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well , having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision . But we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus ; for presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it ; and , before either of us knew what was to happen , we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea , and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface , with the huge hull immediately above us . In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope ; and finding that I was completely beneath the vessel , and my strength utterly exhausted , I scarcely made a struggle for life , and resigned myself , in a few seconds , to die . But here again I was deceived , not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward . The whirl of the water upward , which the vessel occasioned in rolling partially back , brought me to the surface still more violently than I had been plunged beneath . Upon coming up , I found myself about twenty yards from the hulk , as near as I could judge . She was lying keel up , rocking furiously from side to side , and the sea in all directions around was much agitated , and full of strong whirlpools . I could see nothing of Peters . An oil-cask was floating within a few feet of me , and various other articles from the brig were scattered about . My principal terror was now on account of the sharks , which I knew to be in my vicinity . In order to deter these , if possible , from approaching me , I splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as I swam towards the hulk , creating a body of foam . I have no doubt that to this expedient , simple as it was , I was indebted for my preservation ; for the sea all around the brig , just before her rolling over , was so crowded with these monsters , that I must have been , and really was , in actual contact with some of them during my progress . By great good fortune , however , I reached the side of the vessel in safety , although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of Peters , who now , to my great joy , made his appearance ( having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull ) , and threw me the end of a rope -- one of those which had been attached to the spikes . Having barely escaped this danger , our attention was now directed to the dreadful imminency of another ; that of absolute starvation . Our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it ; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more , we gave way both of us to despair , weeping aloud like children , and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other . Such weakness can scarcely be conceived , and to those who have never been similarly situated will , no doubt , appear unnatural ; but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected , that we could not justly be considered , at that period , in the light of rational beings . In subsequent perils , nearly as great , if not greater , I bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation , and Peters , it will be seen , evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility -- the mental condition made the difference . The overturning of the brig , even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle , would not , in fact , have rendered our situation more deplorable than before , except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater , and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught ; for we found the whole bottom , from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel , together with the keel itself , _thickly covered with large barnacles , which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food_ . Thus , in two important respects , the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved a benefit rather than an injury ; it had opened to us a supply of provisions , which we could not have exhausted , using it moderately , in a month ; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position , we being much more at our ease , and in infinitely less danger , than before . The difficulty , however , of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition . That we might be ready to avail ourselves , as far as possible , of any shower which might fall , we took off our shirts , to make use of them as we had of the sheets -- not hoping , of course , to get more in this way , even under the most favourable circumstances , than half a gill at a time . No signs of a cloud appeared during the day , and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable . At night Peters obtained about an hour 's disturbed sleep , but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment . _August 5._ To-day , a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed , among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs , which afforded us several delicious meals . Their shells being quite soft , we ate them entire , and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles . Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed , we also ventured to bathe , and remained in the water for four or five hours , during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst . Were greatly refreshed , and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before , both of us snatching a little sleep . _August 6._ This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain , lasting from about noon until after dark . Bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and carboy ; for , in spite of the little means we had of catching the water , we might have filled one , if not both of them . As it was , we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated , and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths . In this occupation we passed the entire day . _August 7._ Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward , and _evidently coming towards us ! _ We hailed the glorious sight with a long , although feeble shout of rapture ; and began instantly to make every signal in our power , by flaring the shirts in the air , leaping as high as our weak condition would permit , and even by hallooing with all the strength of our lungs , although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant . However , she still continued to near our hulk , and we felt that , if she but held her present course , she must eventually come so close as to perceive us . In about an hour after we first discovered her we could clearly see the people on her decks . She was a long , low , and rakish-looking topsail schooner , with a black ball in her foretopsail , and had , apparently , a full crew . We now became alarmed , for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us , and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were -- an act of fiendish barbarity , which , however incredible it may appear , has been repeatedly perpetrated at sea , under circumstances very nearly similar , and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human species . [ 2 ] In this instance , however , by the mercy of God , we were destined to be most happily deceived ; for presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger , who immediately afterward run up a British flag , and , hauling her wind , bore up directly upon us . In half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin . She proved to be the Jane Guy , of Liverpool , Captain Guy , bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the South Seas and Pacific . [ Footnote 2 : The case of the brig Polly , of Boston , is one so much in point , and her fate , in many respects , so remarkably similar to our own , that I can not forbear alluding to it here . This vessel , of one hundred and thirty tons burden , sailed from Boston , with a cargo of lumber and provisions , for Santa Croix , on the twelfth of December , 1811 , under the command of Captain Casneau . There were eight souls on board besides the captain -- the mate , four seamen , and the cook , together with a Mr. Hunt , and a negro girl belonging to him . On the fifteenth , having cleared the shoal of Georges , she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast , and was finally capsized ; but , the mast going by the board , she afterward righted . They remained in this situation , without fire , and with very little provision , for the period of _one hundred and ninety-one days_ ( from December the fifteenth to June the twentieth ) when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger , the only survivers , were taken off the wreck by the Fame , of Hull , Captain Featherstone , bound home from Rio Janeiro . When picked up they were in latitude _28 N. , longitude 13 W. , having drifted above two thousand miles_ . On the ninth of July the Fame fell in with the brig Dromeo , Captain Perkins , who landed the two sufferers in Kennebeck . The narrative from which we gather these details ends in the following words . `` It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance , upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic , and not be discovered all this time . _They were passed by more than a dozen sail , one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them ; but , to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men , they stifled the dictates of compassion , hoisted sail , and cruelly abandoned them to their fate._ '' ] CHAPTER XIV . The Jane Guy was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden . She was unusually sharp in the bows , and on a wind , in moderate weather , the fastest sailer I have ever seen . Her qualities , however , as a rough sea-boat , were not so good , and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined . For this peculiar service a larger vessel , and one of a light proportionate draught , is desirable -- say a vessel of from three to three hundred and fifty tons . She should be barque-rigged , and in other respects of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships . It is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed . She should have , say ten or twelve twelve pound carronades , and two or three long twelves , with brass blunderbusses , and water-tight arm-chests for each top . Her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade , and , above all , her crew should be numerous and efficient -- not less , for such a vessel as I have described , than fifty or sixty able-bodied men . The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five , all able seamen , besides the captain and mate , but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired . Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner , and of considerable experience in the southern traffic , to which he had devoted a great portion of his life . He was deficient , however , in energy , and , consequently , in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite . He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed , and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand . He had on board , as usual in such voyages , beads , looking-glasses , tinder-works , axes , hatchets , saws , adzes , planes , chisels , gouges , gimlets , files , spokeshaves , rasps , hammers , nails , knives , scissors , razors , needles , thread , crockery-ware , calico , trinkets , and other similar articles . The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July , crossed the Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth , in longitude twenty degrees west , and reached Sal , one of the Cape Verd Islands , on the twenty-ninth , where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage . On the third of August she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest , stretching over towards the coast of Brazil so as to cross the equator between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude . This is the course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of Good Hope , or by that route to the East Indies . By proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of Guinea , while , in the end , it is found to be the shortest track , as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape . It was Captain Guy 's intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen 's Land -- I hardly know for what reason . On the day we were picked up the schooner was off Cape St. Roque , in longitude 31 W. ; so that , when found , we had drifted probably , from north to south , _not less than five-and-twenty degrees_ . On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded . In about a fortnight , during which time we continued steering to the southeast , with gentle breezes and fine weather , both Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful suffering , and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened , than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality . I have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition , whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to joy -- the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange . Thus , in my own case , I now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I endured during the days spent upon the hulk . The incidents are remembered , but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence . I only know that , when they did occur , I _then_ thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony . We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships , and more frequently with the black or right whale , so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti . These , however , were chiefly found south of the twenty-fifth parallel . On the sixteenth of September , being in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope , the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool . In this neighbourhood , but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory ( we were to the westward ) , navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward which rage with great fury . They always bring with them a heavy sea , and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind , an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale . A perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast , and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction , while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable . A bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change , and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions . It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall , and , as usual , from the northward . By eight it had increased very much , and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I had then ever beheld . Everything had been made as snug as possible , but the schooner laboured excessively , and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat , pitching her forecastle under at every plunge , and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another . Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the lookout made its appearance in the southwest , and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast . In two minutes more , in spite of every preparation , we were hurled on our beam-ends as if by magic , and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay . The blow from the southwest , however , luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall , and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar . A heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this , but towards morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale . Captain Guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous . On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward's Island , in latitude 46° 53 ' S. , longitude 37° 46 ' E. Two days afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island , and presently passed the islands of Crozet , in latitude 42° 59 ' S. , longitude 48° E. On the eighteenth we made Kerguelen 's or Desolation Island , in the Southern Indian Ocean , and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour , having four fathoms of water . This island , or rather group of islands , bears southeast from the Cape of Good Hope , and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues . It was first discovered in 1772 , by the Baron de Kergulen , or Kerguelen , a Frenchman , who , thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent , carried home information to that effect , which produced much excitement at the time . The government , taking the matter up , sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination , when the mistake was discovered . In 1777 , Captain Cook fell in with the same group , and gave to the principal one the name of Desolation Island , a title which it certainly well deserves . Upon approaching the land , however , the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise , as the sides of most of the hills , from September to March , are clothed with very brilliant verdure . This deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage , which is abundant , growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss . Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island , if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbour , some lichen , and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed , and which has a bitter and acrid taste . The face of the country is hilly , although none of the hills can be called lofty . Their tops are perpetually covered with snow . There are several harbours , of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient . It is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing Cape François , which forms the northern shore , and , by its peculiar shape , serves to distinguish the harbour . Its projecting point terminates in a high rock , through which is a large hole , forming a natural arch . The entrance is in latitude 48° 40 ' S. , longitude 69° 6' E. Passing in here , good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands , which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds . Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay , at the head of the harbour . This is a small basin , completely landlocked , into which you can go with four fathoms , and find anchorage in from ten to three , hard clay bottom . A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk . To the westward , at the head of Wasp Bay , is a small stream of excellent water , easily procured . Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on Kerguelen 's Island , and sea elephants abound . The feathered tribes are discovered in great numbers . Penguins are very plenty , and of these there are four different kinds . The royal penguin , so called from its size and beautiful plumage , is the largest . The upper part of the body is usually gray , sometimes of a lilach tint ; the under portion of the purest white imaginable . The head is of a glossy and most brilliant black , the feet also . The chief beauty of the plumage , however , consists in two broad stripes of a gold colour , which pass along from the head to the breast . The bill is long , and either pink or bright scarlet . These birds walk erect , with a stately carriage . They carry their heads high , with their wings drooping like two arms , and , as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs , the resemblance to a human figure is very striking , and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening . The royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen 's Land were rather larger than a goose . The other kinds are the macaroni , the jackass , and the rookery penguin . These are much smaller , less beautiful in plumage , and different in other respects . Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found , among which may be mentioned seahens , blue peterels , teal , ducks , Port Egmont hens , shags , Cape pigeons , the nelly , seaswallows , terns , seagulls , Mother Carey 's chickens , Mother Carey 's geese , or the great peterel , and , lastly , the albatross . The great peterel is as large as the common albatross , and is carnivorous . It is frequently called the break-bones , or osprey peterel . They are not at all shy , and , when properly cooked , are palatable food . In flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water , with the wings expanded , without appearing to move them in the least degree , or make any exertion with them whatever . The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea birds . It is of the gull species , and takes its prey on the wing , never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding . Between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists . Their nests are constructed with great uniformity , upon a plan concerted between the two species -- that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four penguins . Navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments _a rookery_ . These rookeries have been often described , but , as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions , and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross , it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living . When the season for incubation arrives , the birds assemble in vast numbers , and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper course to be pursued . At length they proceed to action . A level piece of ground is selected , of suitable extent , usually comprising three or four acres , and situated as near the sea as possible , being still beyond its reach . The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface , and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones . This matter being arranged , the birds proceed , with one accord , and actuated apparently by one mind , to trace out , with mathematical accuracy , either a square or other parallelogram , as may best suit the nature of the ground , and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled , and no more -- in this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labour of the encampment . One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water 's edge , and is left open for ingress or egress . Having defined the limits of the rookery , the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish , picking up stone by stone , and carrying them outside of the lines , and close by them , so as to form a wall on the three inland sides . Just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed , from six to eight feet wide , and extending around the encampment -- thus serving the purpose of a general promenade . The next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size . This is done by forming narrow paths , very smooth , and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the rookery . At each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed , and a penguin 's nest in the centre of each square -- thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses , and each albatross by a like number of penguins . The penguin 's nest consists of a hole in the earth , very shallow , being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling . The albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements , erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter . This is made of earth , seaweed , and shells . On its summit she builds her nest . The birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation , or , indeed , until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves . While the male is absent at sea in search of food , the female remains on duty , and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad . The eggs are never left uncovered at all -- while one bird leaves the nest , the other nestling in by its side . This precaution is rendered necessary by the thievish propensities prevalent in the rookery , the inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other 's eggs at every good opportunity . Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population , yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with , enjoying all the privileges of citizenship , and scattering their nests here and there , wherever they can find room , never interfering , however , with the stations of the larger species . The appearance of such encampments , when seen from a distance , is exceedingly singular . The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross ( mingled with the smaller tribes ) which are continually hovering over it , either going to the ocean or returning home . At the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed , some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys , and some marching , with the military strut so peculiar to them , around the general promenade-ground which encircles the rookery . In short , survey it as we will , nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings , and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect . On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate , Mr. Patterson , took the boats , and ( although it was somewhat early in the season ) went in search of seal , leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward , they having some business , whose nature I could not ascertain , to transact in the interior of the island . Captain Guy took with him a bottle , in which was a sealed letter , and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore towards one of the highest peaks in the place . It is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him . As soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded ( Peters and myself being in the mate 's boat ) on our cruise around the coast , looking for seal . In this business we were occupied about three weeks , examining with great care every nook and corner , not only of Kerguelen 's Land , but of the several small islands in the vicinity . Our labours , however , were not crowned with any important success . We saw a great many fur seal , but they were exceedingly shy , and , with the greatest exertions , we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all . Sea elephants were abundant , especially on the western coast of the main island , but of these we killed only twenty , and this with great difficulty . On the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal , but did not molest them . We returned to the schooner on the eleventh , where we found Captain Guy and his nephew , who gave a very bad account of the interior , representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world . They had remained two nights on the island , owing to some misunderstanding , on the part of the second mate , in regard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off . CHAPTER XV . On the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour , retracing our way to the westward , and leaving Marion 's Island , one of Crozet 's group , on the larboard . We afterward passed Prince Edward 's Island , leaving it also on our left ; then , steering more to the northward , made , in fifteen days , the islands of Tristan d'Acunha , in latitude 37° 8 ' S. , longitude 12° 8 ' W. This group , now so well known , and which consists of three circular islands , was first discovered by the Portuguese , and was visited afterward by the Dutch in 1643 , and by the French in 1767 . The three islands together form a triangle , and are distant from each other about ten miles , there being fine open passages between . The land in all of them is very high , especially in Tristan d'Acunha , properly so called . This is the largest of the group , being fifteen miles in circumference , and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles . A part of the land towards the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea . A tableland at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island , and from this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe . The lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size , but the upper region is barren rock , usually hidden among the clouds , and covered with snow during the greater part of the year . There are no shoals or other dangers about the island , the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep . On the northwestern coast is a bay , with a beach of black sand , where a landing with boats can be easily effected , provided there be a southerly wind . Plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured ; also cod , and other fish , may be taken with hook and line . The next island in point of size , and the most westwardly of the group , is that called the Inaccessible . Its precise situation is 37° 17 ' S. latitude , longitude 12° 24 ' W. It is seven or eight miles in circumference , and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous aspect . Its top is perfectly flat , and the whole region is steril , nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs . Nightingale Island , the smallest and most southerly , is in latitude 37° 26 ' S. , longitude 12° 12 ' W. Off its southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets ; a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the northeast . The ground is irregular and steril , and a deep valley partially separates it . The shores of these islands abound , in the proper season , with sea lions , sea elephants , the hair and fur seal , together with a great variety of oceanic birds . Whales are also plenty in their vicinity . Owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly taken , the group has been much visited since its discovery . The Dutch and French frequented it at a very early period . In 1790 , Captain Patten , of the ship Industry , of Philadelphia , made Tristan d'Acunha , where he remained seven months ( from August , 1790 , to April , 1791 ) for the purpose of collecting sealskins . In this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred , and says that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks . Upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds , with the exception of a few wild goats -- the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals , which have been introduced by subsequent navigators . I believe it was not long after Captain Patten 's visit that Captain Colquhoun , of the American brig Betsey , touched at the largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment . He planted onions , potatoes , cabbages , and a great many other vegetables , an abundance of all which are now to be met with . In 1811 , a Captain Heywood , in the Nereus , visited Tristan . He found there three Americans , who were residing upon the islands to prepare sealskins and oil . One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert , and he called himself the sovereign of the country . He had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land , and turned his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane , with which he had been furnished by the American minister at Rio Janeiro . This settlement , however , was finally abandoned , and in 1817 the islands were taken possession of by the British government , who sent a detachment for that purpose from the Cape of Good Hope . They did not , however , retain them long ; but , upon the evacuation of the country as a British possession , two or three English families took up their residence there independently of the government . On the twenty-fifth of March , 1824 , the Berwick , Captain Jeffrey , from London to Van Diemen 's Land , arrived at the place , where they found an Englishman of the name of Glass , formerly a corporal in the British artillery . He claimed to be supreme governor of the islands , and had under his control twenty-one men and three women . He gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness of the soil . The population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil , with which they traded to the Cape of Good Hope , Glass owning a small schooner . At the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident , but his little community had multiplied , there being fifty-six persons upon Tristan , besides a smaller settlement of seven on Nightingale Island . We had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we required -- sheep , hogs , bullocks , rabbits , poultry , goats , fish in great variety , and vegetables were abundant . Having come to anchor close in with the large island , in eighteen fathoms , we took all we wanted on board very conveniently . Captain Guy also purchased of Glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory . We remained here a week , during which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward , and the weather somewhat hazy . On the fifth of November we made sail to the southward and westward , with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras , respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed . These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762 , by the commander of the ship Aurora . In 1790 , Captain Manuel de Oyarvido , in the ship Princess , belonging to the Royal Philippine Company , sailed , as he asserts , directly among them . In 1794 , the Spanish corvette Atrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation , and , in a paper published by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year 1809 , the following language is used respecting this expedition . `` The corvette Atrevida practised , in their immediate vicinity , from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January , all the necessary observations , and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of Soledad in the Malninas . The islands are three ; they are very nearly in the same meridian ; the centre one is rather low , and the other two may be seen at nine leagues distance . '' The observations made on board the Atrevida give the following results as the precise situation of each island . The most northern is in latitude 52° 37 ' 24 '' S. , longitude 47° 43 ' 15 '' W. ; the middle one in latitude 53° 2 ' 40 '' S. , longitude 47° 55' 15 '' W. ; and the most southern in latitude 53° 15 ' 22 '' S. , longitude 47° 57 ' 15 '' W. On the twenty-seventh of January , 1820 , Captain James Weddel , of the British navy , sailed from Staten Land also in search of the Auroras . He reports that , having made the most diligent search , and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida , but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots , he could discover no indication of land . These conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands ; and , strange to say , while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them , there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them , and even been close in with their shores . It was Captain Guy 's intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute . [ 3 ] [ Footnote 3 : Among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel , in 1769 ; the ship Aurora , in 1774 ; the brig Pearl , in 1779 ; and the ship Dolores , in 1790 . They all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south . ] We kept on our course , between the south and west , with variable weather , until the twentieth of the month , when we found ourselves on the debated ground , being in latitude 53° 15 ' S. , longitude 47° 58' W. -- that is to say , very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group . Not perceiving any sign of land , we continued to the westward in the parallel of fifty-three degrees south , as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west . We then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south , when we turned to the eastward , and kept our parallel by double altitudes , morning and evening , and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon . Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast of Georgia , we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out . We then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed , keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead , and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks , during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair , with no haze whatsoever . Of course we were thoroughly satisfied that , whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period , no vestige of them remained at the present day . Since my return home I find that the same ground was traced over with equal care in 1822 by Captain Johnson , of the American schooner Henry , and by Captain Morrell , in the American schooner Wasp -- in both cases with the same result as in our own . CHAPTER XVI . It had been Captain Guy 's original intention , after satisfying himself about the Auroras , to proceed through the Strait of Magellan , and up along the western coast of Patagonia ; but information received at Tristan d'Acunha induced him to steer to the southward , in the hope of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of 60° S. , longitude 41° 20 ' W. In the event of his not discovering these lands , he designed , should the season prove favourable , to push on towards the pole . Accordingly , on the twelfth of December , we made sail in that direction . On the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by Glass , and cruised for three days in that neighbourhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned . On the twenty-first , the weather being unusually pleasant , we again made sail to the southward , with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible . Before entering upon this portion of my narrative , it may be as well , for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions , to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made . That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct account . In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution , accompanied by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure . In December he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude , and in longitude 26° 57 ' E. Here he met with narrow fields of ice , about eight or ten inches thick , and running northwest and southeast . This ice was in large cakes , and usually it was packed so closely that the vessels had great difficulty in forcing a passage . At this period Captain Cook supposed , from the vast number of birds to be seen , and from other indications , that he was in the near vicinity of land . He kept on to the southward , the weather being exceedingly cold , until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel , in longitude 38° 14 ' E. Here he had mild weather , with gentle breezes , for five days , the thermometer being at thirty-six . In January , 1773 , the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle , but did not succeed in penetrating much farther ; for , upon reaching latitude 67° 15 ' , they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice , extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach . This ice was of every variety -- and some large floes of it , miles in extent , formed a compact mass , rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water . It being late in the season , and no hope entertained of rounding these obstructions , Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to the northward . In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic . In latitude 59° 40 ' he met with a strong current setting to the southward . In December , when the vessels were in latitude 67° 31 ' , longitude 142° 54 ' W. , the cold was excessive , with heavy gales and fog . Here also birds were abundant ; the albatross , the penguin , and the peterel especially . In latitude 70° 23 ' some large islands of ice were encountered , and shortly afterward , the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness , indicating the vicinity of field ice . In latitude 71° 10 ' , longitude 106° 54 ' W. , the navigators were stopped , as before , by an immense frozen expanse , which filled the whole area of the southern horizon . The northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken , so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassable , and extending about a mile to the southward . Behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance , until terminated in the extreme back-ground by gigantic ranges of ice mountains , the one towering above the other . Captain Cook concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a continent . Mr. J. N. Reynolds , whose great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition , partly for the purpose of exploring these regions , thus speaks of the attempt of the Resolution . `` We are not surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71° 10 ' , but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106° 54 ' west longitude . Palmer 's Land lies south of the Shetland , latitude sixty-four degrees , and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated . Cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice ; which , we apprehend , must always be the case in that point , and so early in the season as the sixth of January -- and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of Palmer 's Land , or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward . '' In 1803 , Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were despatched by Alexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe . In endeavouring to get south , they made no farther than 59° 58 ' , in longitude 70° 15 ' W. They here met with strong currents setting eastwardly . Whales were abundant , but they saw no ice . In regard to this voyage , Mr. Reynolds observes that , if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the season , he must have encountered ice -- it was March when he reached the latitude specified . The winds prevailing , as they do , from the southward and westward , had carried the floes , aided by currents , into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia , east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys , and west by the South Shetland Islands . In 1822 , Captain James Weddell , of the British navy , with two very small vessels , penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator , and this too , without encountering extraordinary difficulties . He states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice _before_ reaching the seventy-second parallel , yet , upon attaining it , not a particle was to be discovered , and that , upon arriving at the latitude of 74° 15 ' , no fields , and only three islands of ice were visible . It is somewhat remarkable that , although vast flocks of birds were seen , and other usual indications of land , and although , south of the Shetlands , unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly , Weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south . On the eleventh of January , 1823 , Captain Benjamin Morrell , of the American schooner Wasp , sailed from Kerguelen 's Land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible . On the first of February he found himself in latitude 64° 52 ' S. , longitude 118° 27 ' E. The following passage is extracted from his journal of that date . `` The wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot breeze , and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west ; being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees the less ice was to be apprehended , we steered a little to the southward , until we crossed the Antarctic circle , and were in latitude 69° 15 ' E. In this latitude there was _no field ice_ , and very few ice islands in sight . '' Under the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry . `` The sea was now entirely free of field ice , and there were not more than a dozen ice islands in sight . At the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher ( more mild ) than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south . We were now in latitude 70° 14 ' S. , and the temperature of the air was forty-seven , and that of the water forty-four . In this situation I found the variation to be 14° 27 ' easterly , per azimuth .... I have several times passed within the Antarctic circle on different meridians , and have uniformly found the temperature , both of the air and the water , to become more and more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude , and that the variation decreases in the same proportion . While north of this latitude , say between sixty and sixty-five south , we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands , some of which were from one to two miles in circumference , and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water . '' Being nearly destitute of fuel and water , and without proper instruments , it being also late in the season , Captain Morrell was now obliged to put back , without attempting any farther progress to the southward , although an entirely open sea lay before him . He expresses the opinion that , had not these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat , he could have penetrated , if not to the pole itself , at least to the eighty-fifth parallel . I have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at length , that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience . In 1831 , Captain Briscoe , in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby , whale-ship owners of London , sailed in the brig Lively for the South Seas , accompanied by the cutter Tula . On the twenty-eighth of February , being in latitude 66° 30 ' S. , longitude 47° 31 ' E. , he descried land , and `` clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running E. S. E. '' He remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the following month , but was unable to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues , owing to the boisterous state of the weather . Finding it impossible to make farther discovery during this season , he returned northward to winter in Van Diemen 's Land . In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly , and on the fourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude 67° 15 ' , longitude 69° 29 ' W. This was soon found to be an island near the headland of the country he had first discovered . On the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in landing on the latter , and took possession of it in the name of William IV. , calling it Adelaide 's Island , in honour of the English queen . These particulars being made known to the Royal Geographical Society of London , the conclusion was drawn by that body '' that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47° 30 ' E. to 69° 29 ' W. longitude , running the parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude . '' In respect to this conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes , `` In the correctness of it we by no means concur ; nor do the discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such inference . It was within these limits that Weddell proceeded south on a meridian to the east of Georgia , Sandwich Land , and the South Orkney and Shetland Islands . '' My own experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society . These are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a high southern latitude , and it will now be seen that there remained , previous to the voyage of the Jane , nearly three hundred degrees of longitude in which the Antarctic circle had not been crossed at all . Of course a wide field lay before us for discovery , and it was with feelings of most intense interest that I heard Captain Guy express his resolution of pushing boldly to the southward . CHAPTER XVII . We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search for Glass 's Islands , without meeting with any ice at all . On the twenty-sixth , at noon , we were in latitude 63° 23 ' S. , longitude 41° 25 ' W. We now saw several large ice islands , and a floe of field ice , not , however , of any great extent . The winds generally blew from the southeast , or the northeast , but were very light . Whenever we had a westerly wind , which was seldom , it was invariably attended with a rain squall . Every day we had more or less snow . The thermometer , on the twenty-seventh , stood at thirty-five . _January 1 , 1828._ This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by the ice , and our prospects looked cheerless indeed . A strong gale blew , during the whole forenoon , from the northeast , and drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences . Towards evening , the gale still blowing with fury , a large field in front separated , and we were enabled , by carrying a press of sail , to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open water beyond . As we approached this space we took in sail by degrees , and having at length got clear , lay to under a single reefed foresail . _January 2._ We had now tolerably pleasant weather . At noon we found ourselves in latitude 69° 10 ' S. , longitude 42° 20 ' W. , having crossed the Antarctic circle . Very little ice was to be seen to the southward , although large fields of it lay behind us . This day we rigged some sounding gear , using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons , and a line of two hundred fathoms . We found the current setting to the north , about a quarter of a mile per hour . The temperature of the air was now about thirty-three . Here we found the variation to be 14° 28 ' easterly , per azimuth . _January 5._ We had still held on to the southward without any very great impediments . On this morning , however , being in latitude 73° 15' E. , longitude 42° 10 ' W. , we were again brought to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice . We saw , nevertheless , much open water to the southward , and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually . Standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe , we at length came to a passage of about a mile in width , through which we warped our way by sundown . The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice islands , but had no field ice , and we pushed on boldly as before . The cold did not seem to increase , although we had snow very frequently , and now and then hail squalls of great violence . Immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day , going from southeast to northwest . _January 7._ The sea still remained pretty well open , so that we had no difficulty in holding on our course . To the westward we saw some icebergs of incredible size , and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean . Its girth was probably , at the base , three quarters of a league , and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides . We remained in sight of this island two days , and then only lost it in a fog . _January 10._ Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard . He was an American , named Peter Vredenburgh , a native of New-York , and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner . In going over the bows his foot slipped , and he fell between two cakes of ice , never rising again . At noon of this day we were in latitude 78° 30 ' , longitude 40° 15 ' W. The cold was now excessive , and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward . In this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs , and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice , rising in tiers , one mass above the other . Some driftwood floated by during the evening , and a great quantity of birds flew over , among which were Nellies , peterels , albatrosses , and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage . The variation here , per azimuth , was less than it had been previously to our passing the Antarctic circle . _January 12._ Our passage to the south again looked doubtful , as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe , backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice , one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other . We stood to the westward until the fourteenth , in the hope of finding an entrance . _January 14._ This morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us , and , weathering it , came to an open sea , without a particle of ice . Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms , we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour . The temperature of the air was forty-seven , that of the water thirty-four . We now sailed to the southward , without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth , when , at noon , we were in latitude 81° 21 ' , longitude 42° W. We here again sounded , and found a current setting still southwardly , and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour . The variation per azimuth had diminished , and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant , the thermometer being as high as fifty-one . At this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered . All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole . _January 17._ This day was full of incident . Innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward , and several were shot from the deck ; one of them , a species of pelican , proved to be excellent eating . About midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow , and upon it there appeared to be some large animal . As the weather was good and nearly calm , Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was . Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat . Upon coming up with the floe , we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear , but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals . Being well armed , we made no scruple of attacking it at once . Several shots were fired in quick succession , the most of which took effect , apparently , in the head and body . Nothing discouraged , however , the monster threw himself from the ice , and swam , with open jaws , to the boat in which were Peters and myself . Owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure , no person was ready immediately with a second shot , and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale , and seizing one of the men by the small of his back , before any efficient means were taken to repel him . In this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of Peters saved us from destruction . Leaping upon the back of the huge beast , he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck , reaching the spinal marrow at a blow . The brute tumbled into the sea lifeless , and without a struggle , rolling over Peters as he fell . The latter soon recovered himself , and a rope being thrown him , he secured the carcass before entering the boat . We then returned in triumph to the schooner , towing our trophy behind us . This bear , upon admeasurement , proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length . His wool was perfectly white , and very coarse , curling tightly . The eyes were of a blood red , and larger than those of the Arctic bear -- the snout also more rounded , rather resembling the snout of the bulldog . The meat was tender , but excessively rank and fishy , although the men devoured it with avidity , and declared it excellent eating . Scarcely had we got our prize alongside , when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of _ '' land on the starboard bow ! `` _ All hands were now upon the alert , and , a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward and eastward , we were soon close in with the coast . It proved to be a low rocky islet , of about a league in circumference , and altogether destitute of vegetation , if we except a species of prickly pear . In approaching it from the northward , a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea , and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton . Around this ledge to the westward is a small bay , at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing . It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island , but , with one exception , we found nothing worthy of observation . In the southern extremity , we picked up near the shore , half buried in a pile of loose stones , a piece of wood , which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe . There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it , and Captain Guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise , but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly . Besides this prow , if such it were , we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before . Around the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice -- but these were very few . The exact situation of this islet ( to which Captain Guy gave the name of Bennet 's Islet , in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schooner ) is 82° 50 ' S. latitude , 42° 20 ' W. longitude . We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators , and the sea still lay perfectly open before us . We found , too , that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded , and , what was still more surprising , that the temperature of the air , and latterly of the water , became milder . The weather might even be called pleasant , and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass . The sky was usually clear , with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon -- this , however , was invariably of brief duration . Two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view ; we were getting short of fuel , and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew . These considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the necessity of returning , and he spoke of it frequently . For my own part , confident as I was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing , and having every reason to believe , from present appearances , that we should not find it the steril soil met with in the higher Arctic latitudes , I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering , at least for a few days longer , in the direction we were now holding . So tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man , and I confess that I felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander . I believe , indeed , that what I could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on . While , therefore , I can not but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice , I must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental , however remotely , in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention . CHAPTER XVIII . _January 18._ This morning [ 4 ] we continued to the southward , with the same pleasant weather as before . The sea was entirely smooth , the air tolerably warm and from the northeast , the temperature of the water fifty-three . We now again got our sounding-gear in order , and , with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line , found the current setting towards the pole at the rate of a mile an hour . This constant tendency to the southward , both in the wind and current , caused some degree of speculation , and even of alarm Produced by Ron Swanson THE NARRATIVE OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM .

PREFACE . Upon my return to the United States a few months ago , after the extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere , of which an account is given in the following pages , accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in Richmond , Va. , who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions I had visited , and who were constantly urging it upon me , as a duty , to give my narrative to the public . I had several reasons , however , for declining to do so , some of which were of a nature altogether private , and concern no person but myself ; others not so much so . One consideration which deterred me was , that , having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which I was absent , I feared I should not be able to write , from mere memory , a statement so minute and connected as to have the _appearance_ of that truth it would really possess , barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties . Another reason was , that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous , that , unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be ( except by the evidence of a single individual , and he a half-breed Indian ) , I could only hope for belief among my family , and those of my friends who have had reason , through life , to put faith in my veracity -- the probability being that the public at large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction . A distrust in my own abilities as a writer was , nevertheless , one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestions of my advisers . He strongly advised me , among others , to prepare at once a full account of what I had seen and undergone , and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the public -- insisting , with great plausibility , that however roughly , as regards mere authorship , my book should be got up , its very uncouthness , if there were any , would give it all the better chance of being received as truth . Notwithstanding this representation , I did not make up my mind to do as he suggested . He afterward proposed ( finding that I would not stir in the matter ) that I should allow him to draw up , in his own words , a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures , from facts afforded by myself , publishing it in the Southern Messenger _under the garb of fiction_ . To this , perceiving no objection , I consented , stipulating only that my real name should be retained . The manner in which this _ruse_ was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question ; for I found that , in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the Messenger ( without altering or distorting a single fact ) , the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable , and several letters were sent to Mr. P. 's address distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary . I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity , and that I had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity . Even to those readers who have not seen the Messenger , it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences ; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived . A. G. PYM . New-York , July , 1838 . NARRATIVE OF A. GORDON PYM . My name is Arthur Gordon Pym . My father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at Nantucket , where I was born . My maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice . He was fortunate in everything , and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New-Bank , as it was formerly called . By these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money . He was more attached to myself , I believe , than to any other person in the world , and I expected to inherit the most of his property at his death . He sent me , at six years of age , to the school of old Mr. Ricketts , a gentleman with only one arm , and of eccentric manners -- he is well known to almost every person who has visited New Bedford . I stayed at his school until I was sixteen , when I left him for Mr. E. Ronald 's academy on the hill . Here I became intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard , a sea captain , who generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh -- Mr. Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford , and has many relations , I am certain , in Edgarton . His son was named Augustus , and he was nearly two years older than myself . He had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson , and was always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific Ocean . I used frequently to go home with him , and remain all day , and sometimes all night . We occupied the same bed , and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light , telling me stories of the natives of the Island of Tinian , and other places he had visited in his travels . At last I could not help being interested in what he said , and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go to sea . I owned a sail-boat called the Ariel , and worth about seventy-five dollars . She had a half-deck or cuddy , and was rigged sloop-fashion -- I forget her tonnage , but she would hold ten persons without much crowding . In this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world ; and , when I now think of them , it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive to-day . I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative . One night there was a party at Mr. Barnard 's , and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated towards the close of it . As usual , in such cases , I took part of his bed in preference to going home . He went to sleep , as I thought , very quietly ( it being near one when the party broke up ) , and without saying a word on his favourite topic . It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed , and I was just about falling into a doze , when he suddenly started up , and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom , when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest . I never was so astonished in my life , not knowing what he intended , and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself . He proceeded to talk very coolly , however , saying he knew that I supposed him intoxicated , but that he was never more sober in his life . He was only tired , he added , of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog , and was determined to get up and dress , and go out on a frolic with the boat . I can hardly tell what possessed me , but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure , and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world . It was blowing almost a gale , and the weather was very cold -- it being late in October . I sprang out of bed , nevertheless , in a kind of ecstasy , and told him I was quite as brave as himself , and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog , and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket . We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat . She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of Pankey & Co. , and almost thumping her sides out against the rough logs . Augustus got into her and bailed her , for she was nearly half full of water . This being done , we hoisted jib and mainsail , kept full , and started boldly out to sea . The wind , as I before said , blew freshly from the southwest . The night was very clear and cold . Augustus had taken the helm , and I stationed myself by the mast , on the deck of the cuddy . We flew along at a great rate -- neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf . I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer , and what time he thought it probable we should get back . He whistled for a few minutes , and then said crustily , `` _I_ am going to sea -- _you_ may go home if you think proper . '' Turning my eyes upon him , I perceived at once that , in spite of his assumed _nonchalance_ , he was greatly agitated . I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon -- his face was paler than any marble , and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller . I found that something had gone wrong , and became seriously alarmed . At this period I knew little about the management of a boat , and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend . The wind , too , had suddenly increased , as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land -- still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation , and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence . I could stand it no longer , however , and spoke to Augustus about the propriety of turning back . As before , it was nearly a minute before he made answer , or took any notice of my suggestion . `` By-and-by , '' said he at length -- '' time enough -- home by-and-by . '' I had expected a similar reply , but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread . I again looked at the speaker attentively . His lips were perfectly livid , and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand . `` For God 's sake , Augustus , '' I screamed , now heartily frightened , '' what ails you ? -- what is the matter ? -- what _are_ you going to do ? '' `` Matter ! '' he stammered , in the greatest apparent surprise , letting go the tiller at the same moment , and falling forward into the bottom of the boat -- '' matter ! -- why , nothing is the -- matter -- going home -- d -- d -- do n't you see ? '' The whole truth now flashed upon me . I flew to him and raised him up . He was drunk -- beastly drunk -- he could no longer either stand , speak , or see . His eyes were perfectly glazed ; and as I let him go in the extremity of my despair , he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water from which I had lifted him . It was evident that , during the evening , he had drunk far more than I suspected , and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication -- a state which , like madness , frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses . The coolness of the night air , however , had had its usual effect -- the mental energy began to yield before its influence -- and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe . He was now thoroughly insensible , and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours . It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror . The fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated , leaving me doubly timid and irresolute . I knew that I was altogether incapable of managing the boat , and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to destruction . A storm was evidently gathering behind us ; we had neither compass nor provisions ; and it was clear that , if we held our present course , we should be out of sight of land before daybreak . These thoughts , with a crowd of others equally fearful , flashed through my mind with a bewildering rapidity , and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the possibility of making any exertion . The boat was going through the water at a terrible rate -- full before the wind -- no reef in either jib or mainsail -- running her bows completely under the foam . It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to -- Augustus having let go the tiller , as I said before , and I being too much agitated to think of taking it myself . By good luck , however , she kept steady , and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of mind . Still the wind was increasing fearfully ; and whenever we rose from a plunge forward , the sea behind fell combing over our counter , and deluged us with water . I was so utterly benumbed , too , in every limb , as to be nearly unconscious of sensation . At length I summoned up the resolution of despair , and rushing to the mainsail , let it go by the run . As might have been expected , it flew over the bows , and , getting drenched with water , carried away the mast short off by the board . This latter accident alone saved me from instant destruction . Under the jib only , I now boomed along before the wind , shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter , but relieved from the terror of immediate death . I took the helm , and breathed with greater freedom as I found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape . Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat ; and as there was imminent danger of his drowning ( the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell ) , I contrived to raise him partially up , and keep him in a sitting position , by passing a rope round his waist , and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy . Having thus arranged everything as well as I could in my chilled and agitated condition , I recommended myself to God , and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power . Hardly had I come to this resolution , when , suddenly , a loud and long scream or yell , as if from the throats of a thousand demons , seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat . Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that moment . My hair stood erect on my head -- I felt the blood congealing in my veins -- my heart ceased utterly to beat , and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm , I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fallen companion . I found myself , upon reviving , in the cabin of a large whaling-ship ( the Penguin ) bound to Nantucket . Several persons were standing over me , and Augustus , paler than death , was busily occupied in chafing my hands . Upon seeing me open my eyes , his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were present . The mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained . We had been run down by the whaling-ship , which was close hauled , beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set , and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course . Several men were on the look-out forward , but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact -- their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me . The huge ship , I was told , rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather , and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress . Not a scream arose from the deck of the victim -- there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water , as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer -- but this was all . Thinking our boat ( which it will be remembered was dismasted ) some mere shell cut adrift as useless , the captain ( Captain E. T. V. Block of New London ) was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter . Luckily , there were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm , and represented the possibility of yet saving him . A discussion ensued , when Block grew angry , and , after a while , said that `` it was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells ; that the ship should _not_ put about for any such nonsense ; and if there was a man run down , it was nobody 's fault but his own -- he might drown and be d -- -- d , '' or some language to that effect . Henderson , the first mate , now took the matter up , being justly indignant , as well as the whole ship 's crew , at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity . He spoke plainly , seeing himself upheld by the men , told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows , and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore . He strode aft , jostling Block ( who turned very pale and made no answer ) on one side , and seizing the helm , gave the word , in a firm voice , _Hard-a-lee ! _ The men flew to their posts , and the ship went cleverly about . All this had occupied nearly five minutes , and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved -- allowing any to have been on board the boat . Yet , as the reader has seen , both Augustus and myself were rescued ; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of Providence . While the ship was yet in stays , the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men , I believe , who spoke up as having seen me at the helm . They had just left the lee of the vessel ( the moon still shining brightly ) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward , and Henderson , at the same moment , starting up in his seat , bawled out to his crew to _back water_ . He would say nothing else -- repeating his cry impatiently , _back water ! back water ! _ The men put back as speedily as possible ; but by this time the ship had gone round , and gotten fully under headway , although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail . In despite of the danger of the attempt , the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach . Another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel , when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough . The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom ( the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened ) , and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull . After several ineffectual efforts , made during the lurches of the ship , and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat , I was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board -- for the body proved to be my own . It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper , it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship , and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom . The head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket I had on , and through the back part of my neck , forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear . I was immediately put to bed -- although life seemed to be totally extinct . There was no surgeon on board . The captain , however , treated me with every attention -- to make amends , I presume , in the eyes of his crew , for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure . In the meantime , Henderson had again put off from the ship , although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane . He had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat , and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest . This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour , although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain Block , and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril . Indeed , it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant . She was built , however , for the whaling service , and was fitted , as I have since had reason to believe , with air-boxes , in the manner of some life-boats used on the coast of Wales . After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned , it was determined to get back to the ship . They had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object which floated rapidly by . They pursued and soon overtook it . It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel 's cuddy . Augustus was struggling near it , apparently in the last agonies . Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber . This rope , it will be remembered , I had myself tied round his waist , and made fast to a ringbolt , for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position , and my so doing , it appeared , had been ultimately the means of preserving his life . The Ariel was slightly put together , and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces ; the deck of the cuddy , as might be expected , was lifted , by the force of the water rushing in , entirely from the main timbers , and floated ( with other fragments , no doubt ) to the surface -- Augustus was buoyed up with it , and thus escaped a terrible death . It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before he could give any account of himself , or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our boat . At length he became thoroughly aroused , and spoke much of his sensations while in the water . Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness , he found himself beneath the surface , whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity , and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck . In an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward , when , his head striking violently against a hard substance , he again relapsed into insensibility . Upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason -- this was still , however , in the greatest degree clouded and confused . He now knew that some accident had occurred , and that he was in the water , although his mouth was above the surface , and he could breathe with some freedom . Possibly , at this period , the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind , and drawing him after it , as he floated upon his back . Of course , as long as he could have retained this position , it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned . Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck ; and this post he endeavoured to maintain , screaming at intervals for help . Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson , he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion , and , falling into the sea , had given himself up for lost . During the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel , nor of any matters in connexion with the source of his disaster . A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties . When he was finally picked up , every power of his mind had failed him ; and , as before said , it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he became fully aware of his condition . In regard to myself -- I was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death ( and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half ) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil -- a proceeding suggested by Augustus . The wound in my neck , although of an ugly appearance , proved of little real consequence , and I soon recovered from its effects . The Penguin got into port",The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym

Consider the case of Henry Pifield Rice , detective . I must explain Henry early , to avoid disappointment . If I simply said he was a detective , and let it go at that , I should be obtaining the reader 's interest under false pretences . He was really only a sort of detective , a species of sleuth . At Stafford 's International Investigation Bureau , in the Strand , where he was employed , they did not require him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police . He had never measured a footprint in his life , and what he did not know about bloodstains would have filled a library . The sort of job they gave Henry was to stand outside a restaurant in the rain , and note what time someone inside left it . In short , it is not 'Pifield Rice , Investigator . No . 1. -- The Adventure of the Maharajah 's Ruby ' that I submit to your notice , but the unsensational doings of a quite commonplace young man , variously known to his comrades at the Bureau as 'Fathead ' , 'That blighter what's-his-name ' , and 'Here , you ! ' Henry lived in a boarding-house in Guildford Street . One day a new girl came to the boarding-house , and sat next to Henry at meals . Her name was Alice Weston . She was small and quiet , and rather pretty . They got on splendidly . Their conversation , at first confined to the weather and the moving-pictures , rapidly became more intimate . Henry was surprised to find that she was on the stage , in the chorus . Previous chorus-girls at the boarding-house had been of a more pronounced type -- good girls , but noisy , and apt to wear beauty-spots . Alice Weston was different . ' I 'm rehearsing at present , ' she said . ' I 'm going out on tour next month in `` The Girl From Brighton '' . What do you do , Mr Rice ? ' Henry paused for a moment before replying . He knew how sensational he was going to be . ' I 'm a detective . ' Usually , when he told girls his profession , squeaks of amazed admiration greeted him . Now he was chagrined to perceive in the brown eyes that met his distinct disapproval . 'What 's the matter ? ' he said , a little anxiously , for even at this early stage in their acquaintance he was conscious of a strong desire to win her approval . 'Do n't you like detectives ? ' ' I do n't know . Somehow I should n't have thought you were one . ' This restored Henry 's equanimity somewhat . Naturally a detective does not want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right at the start . ' I think -- you wo n't be offended ? ' 'Go on . ' ' I 've always looked on it as rather a _sneaky_ job . ' 'Sneaky ! ' moaned Henry . 'Well , creeping about , spying on people . ' Henry was appalled . She had defined his own trade to a nicety . There might be detectives whose work was above this reproach , but he was a confirmed creeper , and he knew it . It was n't his fault . The boss told him to creep , and he crept . If he declined to creep , he would be sacked _instanter_ . It was hard , and yet he felt the sting of her words , and in his bosom the first seeds of dissatisfaction with his occupation took root . You might have thought that this frankness on the girl 's part would have kept Henry from falling in love with her . Certainly the dignified thing would have been to change his seat at table , and take his meals next to someone who appreciated the romance of detective work a little more . But no , he remained where he was , and presently Cupid , who never shoots with a surer aim than through the steam of boarding-house hash , sniped him where he sat . He proposed to Alice Weston . She refused him . 'It 's not because I 'm not fond of you . I think you 're the nicest man I ever met . ' A good deal of assiduous attention had enabled Henry to win this place in her affections . He had worked patiently and well before actually putting his fortune to the test . ' I 'd marry you tomorrow if things were different . But I 'm on the stage , and I mean to stick there . Most of the girls want to get off it , but not me . And one thing I'll never do is marry someone who is n't in the profession . My sister Genevieve did , and look what happened to her . She married a commercial traveller , and take it from me he travelled . She never saw him for more than five minutes in the year , except when he was selling gent's hosiery in the same town where she was doing her refined speciality , and then he 'd just wave his hand and whiz by , and start travelling again . My husband has got to be close by , where I can see him . I'm sorry , Henry , but I know I 'm right . ' It seemed final , but Henry did not wholly despair . He was a resolute young man . You have to be to wait outside restaurants in the rain for any length of time . He had an inspiration . He sought out a dramatic agent . ' I want to go on the stage , in musical comedy . ' 'Let 's see you dance . ' ' I ca n't dance . ' 'Sing , ' said the agent . 'Stop singing , ' added the agent , hastily . 'You go away and have a nice cup of hot tea , ' said the agent , soothingly , 'and you 'll be as right as anything in the morning . ' Henry went away . A few days later , at the Bureau , his fellow-detective Simmonds hailed him . 'Here , you ! The boss wants you . Buck up ! ' Mr Stafford was talking into the telephone . He replaced the receiver as Henry entered . 'Oh , Rice , here 's a woman wants her husband shadowed while he 's on the road . He 's an actor . I 'm sending you . Go to this address , and get photographs and all particulars . You 'll have to catch the eleven o'clock train on Friday . ' 'Yes , sir . ' 'He 's in `` The Girl From Brighton '' company . They open at Bristol . ' It sometimes seemed to Henry as if Fate did it on purpose . If the commission had had to do with any other company , it would have been well enough , for , professionally speaking , it was the most important with which he had ever been entrusted . If he had never met Alice Weston , and heard her views upon detective work , he would have been pleased and flattered . Things being as they were , it was Henry's considered opinion that Fate had slipped one over on him . In the first place , what torture to be always near her , unable to reveal himself ; to watch her while she disported herself in the company of other men . He would be disguised , and she would not recognize him ; but he would recognize her , and his sufferings would be dreadful . In the second place , to have to do his creeping about and spying practically in her presence -- Still , business was business . At five minutes to eleven on the morning named he was at the station , a false beard and spectacles shielding his identity from the public eye . If you had asked him he would have said that he was a Scotch business man . As a matter of fact , he looked far more like a motor-car coming through a haystack . The platform was crowded . Friends of the company had come to see the company off . Henry looked on discreetly from behind a stout porter , whose bulk formed a capital screen . In spite of himself , he was impressed . The stage at close quarters always thrilled him . He recognized celebrities . The fat man in the brown suit was Walter Jelliffe , the comedian and star of the company . He stared keenly at him through the spectacles . Others of the famous were scattered about . He saw Alice . She was talking to a man with a face like a hatchet , and smiling , too , as if she enjoyed it . Behind the matted foliage which he had inflicted on his face , Henry 's teeth came together with a snap . In the weeks that followed , as he dogged 'The Girl From Brighton' company from town to town , it would be difficult to say whether Henry was happy or unhappy . On the one hand , to realize that Alice was so near and yet so inaccessible was a constant source of misery ; yet , on the other , he could not but admit that he was having the very dickens of a time , loafing round the country like this . He was made for this sort of life , he considered . Fate had placed him in a London office , but what he really enjoyed was this unfettered travel . Some gipsy strain in him rendered even the obvious discomforts of theatrical touring agreeable . He liked catching trains ; he liked invading strange hotels ; above all , he revelled in the artistic pleasure of watching unsuspecting fellow-men as if they were so many ants . That was really the best part of the whole thing . It was all very well for Alice to talk about creeping and spying , but , if you considered it without bias , there was nothing degrading about it at all . It was an art . It took brains and a genius for disguise to make a man a successful creeper and spyer . You could n't simply say to yourself , ' I will creep . ' If you attempted to do it in your own person , you would be detected instantly . You had to be an adept at masking your personality . You had to be one man at Bristol and another quite different man at Hull -- especially if , like Henry , you were of a gregarious disposition , and liked the society of actors . The stage had always fascinated Henry . To meet even minor members of the profession off the boards gave him a thrill . There was a resting juvenile , of fit-up calibre , at his boarding-house who could always get a shilling out of him simply by talking about how he had jumped in and saved the show at the hamlets which he had visited in the course of his wanderings . And on this 'Girl From Brighton ' tour he was in constant touch with men who really amounted to something . Walter Jelliffe had been a celebrity when Henry was going to school ; and Sidney Crane , the baritone , and others of the lengthy cast , were all players not unknown in London . Henry courted them assiduously . It had not been hard to scrape acquaintance with them . The principals of the company always put up at the best hotel , and -- his expenses being paid by his employer -- so did Henry . It was the easiest thing possible to bridge with a well-timed whisky-and-soda the gulf between non-acquaintance and warm friendship . Walter Jelliffe , in particular , was peculiarly accessible . Every time Henry accosted him -- as a different individual , of course -- and renewed in a fresh disguise the friendship which he had enjoyed at the last town , Walter Jelliffe met him more than half-way . It was in the sixth week of the tour that the comedian , promoting him from mere casual acquaintanceship , invited him to come up to his room and smoke a cigar . Henry was pleased and flattered . Jelliffe was a personage , always surrounded by admirers , and the compliment was consequently of a high order . He lit his cigar . Among his friends at the Green-Room Club it was unanimously held that Walter Jelliffe 's cigars brought him within the scope of the law forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons ; but Henry would have smoked the gift of such a man if it had been a cabbage-leaf . He puffed away contentedly . He was made up as an old Indian colonel that week , and he complimented his host on the aroma with a fine old-world courtesy . Walter Jelliffe seemed gratified . 'Quite comfortable ? ' he asked . 'Quite , I thank you , ' said Henry , fondling his silver moustache . 'That 's right . And now tell me , old man , which of us is it you're trailing ? ' Henry nearly swallowed his cigar . 'What do you mean ? ' 'Oh , come , ' protested Jelliffe ; 'there 's no need to keep it up with me . I know you 're a detective . The question is , Who 's the man you 're after ? That 's what we 've all been wondering all this time . ' All ! They had all been wondering ! It was worse than Henry could have imagined . Till now he had pictured his position with regard to 'The Girl From Brighton ' company rather as that of some scientist who , seeing but unseen , keeps a watchful eye on the denizens of a drop of water under his microscope . And they had all detected him -- every one of them . It was a stunning blow . If there was one thing on which Henry prided himself it was the impenetrability of his disguises . He might be slow ; he might be on the stupid side ; but he could disguise himself . He had a variety of disguises , each designed to befog the public more hopelessly than the last . Going down the street , you would meet a typical commercial traveller , dapper and alert . Anon , you encountered a heavily bearded Australian . Later , maybe , it was a courteous old retired colonel who stopped you and inquired the way to Trafalgar Square . Still later , a rather flashy individual of the sporting type asked you for a match for his cigar . Would you have suspected for one instant that each of these widely differing personalities was in reality one man ? Certainly you would . Henry did not know it , but he had achieved in the eyes of the small servant who answered the front-door bell at his boarding-house a well-established reputation as a humorist of the more practical kind . It was his habit to try his disguises on her . He would ring the bell , inquire for the landlady , and when Bella had gone , leap up the stairs to his room . Here he would remove the disguise , resume his normal appearance , and come downstairs again , humming a careless air . Bella , meanwhile , in the kitchen , would be confiding to her ally the cook that 'Mr Rice had jest come in , lookin ' sort o ' funny again ' . He sat and gaped at Walter Jelliffe . The comedian regarded him curiously . 'You look at least a hundred years old , ' he said . 'What are you made up as ? A piece of Gorgonzola ? ' Henry glanced hastily at the mirror . Yes , he did look rather old . He must have overdone some of the lines on his forehead . He looked something between a youngish centenarian and a nonagenarian who had seen a good deal of trouble . 'If you knew how you were demoralizing the company , ' Jelliffe went on , 'you would drop it . As steady and quiet a lot of boys as ever you met till you came along . Now they do nothing but bet on what disguise you 're going to choose for the next town . I do n't see why you need to change so often . You were all right as the Scotchman at Bristol . We were all saying how nice you looked . You should have stuck to that . But what do you do at Hull but roll in in a scrubby moustache and a tweed suit , looking rotten . However , all that is beside the point . It 's a free country . If you like to spoil your beauty , I suppose there 's no law against it . What I want to know is , who 's the man ? Whose track are you sniffing on , Bill ? You 'll pardon my calling you Bill . You 're known as Bill the Bloodhound in the company . Who 's the man ? ' 'Never mind , ' said Henry . He was aware , as he made it , that it was not a very able retort , but he was feeling too limp for satisfactory repartee . Criticisms in the Bureau , dealing with his alleged solidity of skull , he did not resent . He attributed them to man 's natural desire to chaff his fellow-man . But to be unmasked by the general public in this way was another matter . It struck at the root of all things . 'But I do mind , ' objected Jelliffe . 'It 's most important . A lot of money hangs on it . We 've got a sweepstake on in the company , the holder of the winning name to take the entire receipts . Come on . Who is he ? ' Henry rose and made for the door . His feelings were too deep for words . Even a minor detective has his professional pride ; and the knowledge that his espionage is being made the basis of sweepstakes by his quarry cuts this to the quick . 'Here , do n't go ! Where are you going ? ' 'Back to London , ' said Henry , bitterly . 'It 's a lot of good my staying here now , is n't it ? ' ' I should say it was -- to me . Do n't be in a hurry . You 're thinking that , now we know all about you , your utility as a sleuth has waned to some extent . Is that it ? ' 'Well ? ' 'Well , why worry ? What does it matter to you ? You do n't get paid by results , do you ? Your boss said `` Trail along . '' Well , do it , then . I should hate to lose you . I do n't suppose you know it , but you 've been the best mascot this tour that I 've ever come across . Right from the start we 've been playing to enormous business . I 'd rather kill a black cat than lose you . Drop the disguises , and stay with us . Come behind all you want , and be sociable . ' A detective is only human . The less of a detective , the more human he is . Henry was not much of a detective , and his human traits were consequently highly developed . From a boy , he had never been able to resist curiosity . If a crowd collected in the street he always added himself to it , and he would have stopped to gape at a window with 'Watch this window ' written on it , if he had been running for his life from wild bulls . He was , and always had been , intensely desirous of some day penetrating behind the scenes of a theatre . And there was another thing . At last , if he accepted this invitation , he would be able to see and speak to Alice Weston , and interfere with the manoeuvres of the hatchet-faced man , on whom he had brooded with suspicion and jealousy since that first morning at the station . To see Alice ! Perhaps , with eloquence , to talk her out of that ridiculous resolve of hers ! 'Why , there 's something in that , ' he said . 'Rather ! Well , that 's settled . And now , touching that sweep , who _is_ it ? ' ' I ca n't tell you that . You see , so far as that goes , I 'm just where I was before . I can still watch -- whoever it is I 'm watching . ' 'Dash it , so you can . I did n't think of that , ' said Jelliffe , who possessed a sensitive conscience . 'Purely between ourselves , it isn't _me_ , is it ? ' Henry eyed him inscrutably . He could look inscrutable at times . 'Ah ! ' he said , and left quickly , with the feeling that , however poorly he had shown up during the actual interview , his exit had been good . He might have been a failure in the matter of disguise , but nobody could have put more quiet sinister-ness into that 'Ah ! ' It did much to soothe him and ensure a peaceful night 's rest . On the following night , for the first time in his life , Henry found himself behind the scenes of a theatre , and instantly began to experience all the complex emotions which come to the layman in that situation . That is to say , he felt like a cat which has strayed into a strange hostile back-yard . He was in a new world , inhabited by weird creatures , who flitted about in an eerie semi-darkness , like brightly coloured animals in a cavern . 'The Girl From Brighton ' was one of those exotic productions specially designed for the Tired Business Man . It relied for a large measure of its success on the size and appearance of its chorus , and on their constant change of costume . Henry , as a consequence , was the centre of a kaleidoscopic whirl of feminine loveliness , dressed to represent such varying flora and fauna as rabbits , Parisian students , colleens , Dutch peasants , and daffodils . Musical comedy is the Irish stew of the drama . Anything may be put into it , with the certainty that it will improve the general effect . He scanned the throng for a sight of Alice . Often as he had seen the piece in the course of its six weeks ' wandering in the wilderness he had never succeeded in recognizing her from the front of the house . Quite possibly , he thought , she might be on the stage already , hidden in a rose-tree or some other shrub , ready at the signal to burst forth upon the audience in short skirts ; for in 'The Girl From Brighton' almost anything could turn suddenly into a chorus-girl . Then he saw her , among the daffodils . She was not a particularly convincing daffodil , but she looked good to Henry . With wabbling knees he butted his way through the crowd and seized her hand enthusiastically . 'Why , Henry ! Where did you come from ? ' ' I _am_ glad to see you ! ' 'How did you get here ? ' ' I _am_ glad to see you ! ' At this point the stage-manager , bellowing from the prompt-box , urged Henry to desist . It is one of the mysteries of behind-the-scenes acoustics that a whisper from any minor member of the company can be heard all over the house , while the stage-manager can burst himself without annoying the audience . Henry , awed by authority , relapsed into silence . From the unseen stage came the sound of someone singing a song about the moon . June was also mentioned . He recognized the song as one that had always bored him . He disliked the woman who was singing it -- a Miss Clarice Weaver , who played the heroine of the piece to Sidney Crane 's hero . In his opinion he was not alone . Miss Weaver was not popular in the company . She had secured the role rather as a testimony of personal esteem from the management than because of any innate ability . She sang badly , acted indifferently , and was uncertain what to do with her hands . All these things might have been forgiven her , but she supplemented them by the crime known in stage circles as 'throwing her weight about ' . That is to say , she was hard to please , and , when not pleased , apt to say so in no uncertain voice . To his personal friends Walter Jelliffe had frequently confided that , though not a rich man , he was in the market with a substantial reward for anyone who was man enough to drop a ton of iron on Miss Weaver . Tonight the song annoyed Henry more than usual , for he knew that very soon the daffodils were due on the stage to clinch the verisimilitude of the scene by dancing the tango with the rabbits . He endeavoured to make the most of the time at his disposal . ' I _am_ glad to see you ! ' he said . 'Sh-h ! ' said the stage-manager . Henry was discouraged . Romeo could not have made love under these conditions . And then , just when he was pulling himself together to begin again , she was torn from him by the exigencies of the play . He wandered moodily off into the dusty semi-darkness . He avoided the prompt-box , whence he could have caught a glimpse of her , being loath to meet the stage-manager just at present . Walter Jelliffe came up to him , as he sat on a box and brooded on life . ' A little less of the double forte , old man , ' he said . 'Miss Weaver has been kicking about the noise on the side . She wanted you thrown out , but I said you were my mascot , and I would die sooner than part with you . But I should go easy on the chest-notes , I think , all the same . ' Henry nodded moodily . He was depressed . He had the feeling , which comes so easily to the intruder behind the scenes , that nobody loved him . The piece proceeded . From the front of the house roars of laughter indicated the presence on the stage of Walter Jelliffe , while now and then a lethargic silence suggested that Miss Clarice Weaver was in action . From time to time the empty space about him filled with girls dressed in accordance with the exuberant fancy of the producer of the piece . When this happened , Henry would leap from his seat and endeavour to locate Alice ; but always , just as he thought he had done so , the hidden orchestra would burst into melody and the chorus would be called to the front . It was not till late in the second act that he found an opportunity for further speech . The plot of 'The Girl From Brighton ' had by then reached a critical stage . The situation was as follows : The hero , having been disinherited by his wealthy and titled father for falling in love with the heroine , a poor shop-girl , has disguised himself ( by wearing a different coloured necktie ) and has come in pursuit of her to a well-known seaside resort , where , having disguised herself by changing her dress , she is serving as a waitress in the Rotunda , on the Esplanade . The family butler , disguised as a Bath-chair man , has followed the hero , and the wealthy and titled father , disguised as an Italian opera-singer , has come to the place for a reason which , though extremely sound , for the moment eludes the memory . Anyhow , he is there , and they all meet on the Esplanade . Each recognizes the other , but thinks he himself is unrecognized . _Exeunt_ all , hurriedly , leaving the heroine alone on the stage . It is a crisis in the heroine 's life . She meets it bravely . She sings a song entitled 'My Honolulu Queen ' , with chorus of Japanese girls and Bulgarian officers . Alice was one of the Japanese girls . She was standing a little apart from the other Japanese girls . Henry was on her with a bound . Now was his time . He felt keyed up , full of persuasive words . In the interval which had elapsed since their last conversation yeasty emotions had been playing the dickens with his self-control . It is practically impossible for a novice , suddenly introduced behind the scenes of a musical comedy , not to fall in love with somebody ; and , if he is already in love , his fervour is increased to a dangerous point . Henry felt that it was now or never . He forgot that it was perfectly possible -- indeed , the reasonable course -- to wait till the performance was over , and renew his appeal to Alice to marry him on the way back to her hotel . He had the feeling that he had got just about a quarter of a minute . Quick action ! That was Henry 's slogan . He seized her hand . 'Alice ! ' 'Sh-h ! ' hissed the stage-manager . 'Listen ! I love you . I 'm crazy about you . What does it matter whether I 'm on the stage or not ? I love you . ' 'Stop that row there ! ' 'Wo n't you marry me ? ' She looked at him . It seemed to him that she hesitated . 'Cut it out ! ' bellowed the stage-manager , and Henry cut it out . And at this moment , when his whole fate hung in the balance , there came from the stage that devastating high note which is the sign that the solo is over and that the chorus are now about to mobilize . As if drawn by some magnetic power , she suddenly receded from him , and went on to the stage . A man in Henry 's position and frame of mind is not responsible for his actions . He saw nothing but her ; he was blind to the fact that important manoeuvres were in progress . All he understood was that she was going from him , and that he must stop her and get this thing settled . He clutched at her . She was out of range , and getting farther away every instant . He sprang forward . The advice that should be given to every young man starting life is -- if you happen to be behind the scenes at a theatre , never spring forward . The whole architecture of the place is designed to undo those who so spring . Hours before , the stage-carpenters have laid their traps , and in the semi-darkness you can not but fall into them . The trap into which Henry fell was a raised board . It was not a very highly-raised board . It was not so deep as a well , nor so wide as a church-door , but 't was enough -- it served . Stubbing it squarely with his toe , Henry shot forward , all arms and legs . It is the instinct of Man , in such a situation , to grab at the nearest support . Henry grabbed at the Hotel Superba , the pride of the Esplanade . It was a thin wooden edifice , and it supported him for perhaps a tenth of a second . Then he staggered with it into the limelight , tripped over a Bulgarian officer who was inflating himself for a deep note , and finally fell in a complicated heap as exactly in the centre of the stage as if he had been a star of years ' standing . It went well ; there was no question of that . Previous audiences had always been rather cold towards this particular song , but this one got on its feet and yelled for more . From all over the house came rapturous demands that Henry should go back and do it again . But Henry was giving no encores . He rose to his feet , a little stunned , and automatically began to dust his clothes . The orchestra , unnerved by this unrehearsed infusion of new business , had stopped playing . Bulgarian officers and Japanese girls alike seemed unequal to the situation . They stood about , waiting for the next thing to break loose . From somewhere far away came faintly the voice of the stage-manager inventing new words , new combinations of words , and new throat noises . And then Henry , massaging a stricken elbow , was aware of Miss Weaver at his side . Looking up , he caught Miss Weaver 's eye . A familiar stage-direction of melodrama reads , 'Exit cautious through gap in hedge ' . It was Henry 's first appearance on any stage , but he did it like a veteran . 'My dear fellow , ' said Walter Jelliffe . The hour was midnight , and he was sitting in Henry 's bedroom at the hotel . Leaving the theatre , Henry had gone to bed almost instinctively . Bed seemed the only haven for him . 'My dear fellow , do n't apologize . You have put me under lasting obligations . In the first place , with your unerring sense of the stage , you saw just the spot where the piece needed livening up , and you livened it up . That was good ; but far better was it that you also sent our Miss Weaver into violent hysterics , from which she emerged to hand in her notice . She leaves us tomorrow . ' Henry was appalled at the extent of the disaster for which he was responsible . 'What will you do ? ' 'Do ! Why , it 's what we have all been praying for -- a miracle which should eject Miss Weaver . It needed a genius like you to come to bring it off . Sidney Crane 's wife can play the part without rehearsal . She understudied it all last season in London . Crane has just been speaking to her on the phone , and she is catching the night express . ' Henry sat up in bed . 'What ! ' 'What 's the trouble now ? ' 'Sidney Crane 's wife ? ' 'What about her ? ' A bleakness fell upon Henry 's soul . 'She was the woman who was employing me . Now I shall be taken off the job and have to go back to London . ' 'You do n't mean that it was really Crane 's wife ? ' Jelliffe was regarding him with a kind of awe . 'Laddie , ' he said , in a hushed voice , 'you almost scare me . There seems to be no limit to your powers as a mascot . You fill the house every night , you get rid of the Weaver woman , and now you tell me this . I drew Crane in the sweep , and I would have taken twopence for my chance of winning it . ' ' I shall get a telegram from my boss tomorrow recalling me . ' 'Do n't go . Stick with me . Join the troupe . ' Henry stared . 'What do you mean ? I ca n't sing or act . ' Jelliffe 's voice thrilled with earnestness . 'My boy , I can go down the Strand and pick up a hundred fellows who can sing and act . I do n't want them . I turn them away . But a seventh son of a seventh son like you , a human horseshoe like you , a king of mascots like you -- they do n't make them nowadays . They 've lost the pattern . If you like to come with me I 'll give you a contract for any number of years you suggest . I need you in my business . ' He rose . 'Think it over , laddie , and let me know tomorrow . Look here upon this picture , and on that . As a sleuth you are poor . You could n't detect a bass-drum in a telephone-booth . You have no future . You are merely among those present . But as a mascot -- my boy , you 're the only thing in sight . You ca n't help succeeding on the stage . You do n't have to know how to act . Look at the dozens of good actors who are out of jobs . Why ? Unlucky . No other reason . With your luck and a little experience you 'll be a star before you know you 've begun . Think it over , and let me know in the morning . ' Before Henry 's eyes there rose a sudden vision of Alice : Alice no longer unattainable ; Alice walking on his arm down the aisle ; Alice mending his socks ; Alice with her heavenly hands fingering his salary envelope . 'Do n't go , ' he said . 'Do n't go . I 'll let you know now . ' * * * * * The scene is the Strand , hard by Bedford Street ; the time , that restful hour of the afternoon when they of the gnarled faces and the bright clothing gather together in groups to tell each other how good they are . Hark ! A voice . 'Rather ! Courtneidge and the Guv'nor keep on trying to get me , but I turn them down every time . `` No , '' I said to Malone only yesterday , `` not for me ! I 'm going with old Wally Jelliffe , the same as usual , and there is n't the money in the Mint that 'll get me away . '' Malone got all worked up . He -- ' It is the voice of Pifield Rice , actor . EXTRICATING YOUNG GUSSIE She sprang it on me before breakfast . There in seven words you have a complete character sketch of my Aunt Agatha . I could go on indefinitely about brutality and lack of consideration . I merely say that she routed me out of bed to listen to her painful story somewhere in the small hours . It ca n't have been half past eleven when Jeeves , my man , woke me out of the dreamless and broke the news : 'Mrs Gregson to see you , sir . ' I thought she must be walking in her sleep , but I crawled out of bed and got into a dressing-gown . I knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know that , if she had come to see me , she was going to see me . That 's the sort of woman she is . She was sitting bolt upright in a chair , staring into space . When I came in she looked at me in that darn critical way that always makes me feel as if I had gelatine where my spine ought to be . Aunt Agatha is one of those strong-minded women . I should think Queen Elizabeth must have been something like her . She bosses her husband , Spencer Gregson , a battered little chappie on the Stock Exchange . She bosses my cousin , Gussie Mannering-Phipps . She bosses her sister-in-law , Gussie 's mother . And , worst of all , she bosses me . She has an eye like a man-eating fish , and she has got moral suasion down to a fine point . I dare say there are fellows in the world -- men of blood and iron , don't you know , and all that sort of thing -- whom she could n't intimidate ; but if you 're a chappie like me , fond of a quiet life , you simply curl into a ball when you see her coming , and hope for the best . My experience is that when Aunt Agatha wants you to do a thing you do it , or else you find yourself wondering why those fellows in the olden days made such a fuss when they had trouble with the Spanish Inquisition . 'Halloa , Aunt Agatha ! ' I said 'Bertie , ' she said , 'you look a sight . You look perfectly dissipated . ' I was feeling like a badly wrapped brown-paper parcel . I 'm never at my best in the early morning . I said so . 'Early morning ! I had breakfast three hours ago , and have been walking in the park ever since , trying to compose my thoughts . ' If I ever breakfasted at half past eight I should walk on the Embankment , trying to end it all in a watery grave . ' I am extremely worried , Bertie . That is why I have come to you . ' And then I saw she was going to start something , and I bleated weakly to Jeeves to bring me tea . But she had begun before I could get it . 'What are your immediate plans , Bertie ? ' 'Well , I rather thought of tottering out for a bite of lunch later on , and then possibly staggering round to the club , and after that , if I felt strong enough , I might trickle off to Walton Heath for a round of golf . ' I am not interested in your totterings and tricklings . I mean , have you any important engagements in the next week or so ? ' I scented danger . 'Rather , ' I said . 'Heaps ! Millions ! Booked solid ! ' 'What are they ? ' ' I -- er -- well , I do n't quite know . ' ' I thought as much . You have no engagements . Very well , then , I want you to start immediately for America . ' 'America ! ' Do not lose sight of the fact that all this was taking place on an empty stomach , shortly after the rising of the lark . 'Yes , America . I suppose even you have heard of America ? ' 'But why America ? ' 'Because that is where your Cousin Gussie is . He is in New York , and I ca n't get at him . ' 'What 's Gussie been doing ? ' 'Gussie is making a perfect idiot of himself . ' To one who knew young Gussie as well as I did , the words opened up a wide field for speculation . 'In what way ? ' 'He has lost his head over a creature . ' On past performances this rang true . Ever since he arrived at man's estate Gussie had been losing his head over creatures . He 's that sort of chap . But , as the creatures never seemed to lose their heads over him , it had never amounted to much . ' I imagine you know perfectly well why Gussie went to America , Bertie . You know how wickedly extravagant your Uncle Cuthbert was . ' She alluded to Gussie 's governor , the late head of the family , and I am bound to say she spoke the truth . Nobody was fonder of old Uncle Cuthbert than I was , but everybody knows that , where money was concerned , he was the most complete chump in the annals of the nation . He had an expensive thirst . He never backed a horse that did n't get housemaid 's knee in the middle of the race . He had a system of beating the bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration hang out the bunting and ring the joy-bells when he was sighted in the offing . Take him for all in all , dear old Uncle Cuthbert was as willing a spender as ever called the family lawyer a bloodsucking vampire because he would n't let Uncle Cuthbert cut down the timber to raise another thousand . 'He left your Aunt Julia very little money for a woman in her position . Beechwood requires a great deal of keeping up , and poor dear Spencer , though he does his best to help , has not unlimited resources . It was clearly understood why Gussie went to America . He is not clever , but he is very good-looking , and , though he has no title , the Mannering-Phippses are one of the best and oldest families in England . He had some excellent letters of introduction , and when he wrote home to say that he had met the most charming and beautiful girl in the world I felt quite happy . He continued to rave about her for several mails , and then this morning a letter has come from him in which he says , quite casually as a sort of afterthought , that he knows we are broadminded enough not to think any the worse of her because she is on the vaudeville stage . ' 'Oh , I say ! ' 'It was like a thunderbolt . The girl 's name , it seems , is Ray Denison , and according to Gussie she does something which he describes as a single on the big time . What this degraded performance may be I have not the least notion . As a further recommendation he states that she lifted them out of their seats at Mosenstein 's last week . Who she may be , and how or why , and who or what Mr Mosenstein may be , I can not tell you . ' 'By jove , ' I said , 'it 's like a sort of thingummybob , is n't it ? A sort of fate , what ? ' ' I fail to understand you . ' 'Well , Aunt Julia , you know , do n't you know ? Heredity , and so forth . What 's bred in the bone will come out in the wash , and all that kind of thing , you know . ' 'Do n't be absurd , Bertie . ' That was all very well , but it was a coincidence for all that . Nobody ever mentions it , and the family have been trying to forget it for twenty-five years , but it 's a known fact that my Aunt Julia , Gussie's mother , was a vaudeville artist once , and a very good one , too , I'm told . She was playing in pantomime at Drury Lane when Uncle Cuthbert saw her first . It was before my time , of course , and long before I was old enough to take notice the family had made the best of it , and Aunt Agatha had pulled up her socks and put in a lot of educative work , and with a microscope you could n't tell Aunt Julia from a genuine dyed-in-the-wool aristocrat . Women adapt themselves so quickly ! I have a pal who married Daisy Trimble of the Gaiety , and when I meet her now I feel like walking out of her presence backwards . But there the thing was , and you could n't get away from it . Gussie had vaudeville blood in him , and it looked as if he were reverting to type , or whatever they call it . 'By Jove , ' I said , for I am interested in this heredity stuff , 'perhaps the thing is going to be a regular family tradition , like you read about in books -- a sort of Curse of the Mannering-Phippses , as it were . Perhaps each head of the family 's going to marry into vaudeville for ever and ever . Unto the what-d'you-call-it generation , do n't you know ? ' 'Please do not be quite idiotic , Bertie . There is one head of the family who is certainly not going to do it , and that is Gussie . And you are going to America to stop him . ' 'Yes , but why me ? ' 'Why you ? You are too vexing , Bertie . Have you no sort of feeling for the family ? You are too lazy to try to be a credit to yourself , but at least you can exert yourself to prevent Gussie 's disgracing us . You are going to America because you are Gussie 's cousin , because you have always been his closest friend , because you are the only one of the family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf and night clubs . ' ' I play a lot of auction . ' 'And as you say , idiotic gambling in low dens . If you require another reason , you are going because I ask you as a personal favour . ' What she meant was that , if I refused , she would exert the full bent of her natural genius to make life a Hades for me . She held me with her glittering eye . I have never met anyone who can give a better imitation of the Ancient Mariner . 'So you will start at once , wo n't you , Bertie ? ' I did n't hesitate . 'Rather ! ' I said . 'Of course I will' Jeeves came in with the tea . 'Jeeves , ' I said , 'we start for America on Saturday . ' 'Very good , sir , ' he said ; 'which suit will you wear ? ' New York is a large city conveniently situated on the edge of America , so that you step off the liner right on to it without an effort . You ca n't lose your way . You go out of a barn and down some stairs , and there you are , right in among it . The only possible objection any reasonable chappie could find to the place is that they loose you into it from the boat at such an ungodly hour . I left Jeeves to get my baggage safely past an aggregation of suspicious-minded pirates who were digging for buried treasures among my new shirts , and drove to Gussie 's hotel , where I requested the squad of gentlemanly clerks behind the desk to produce him . That 's where I got my first shock . He was n't there . I pleaded with them to think again , and they thought again , but it was no good . No Augustus Mannering-Phipps on the premises . I admit I was hard hit . There I was alone in a strange city and no signs of Gussie . What was the next step ? I am never one of the master minds in the early morning ; the old bean does n't somehow seem to get into its stride till pretty late in the p.m. 's , and I could n't think what to do . However , some instinct took me through a door at the back of the lobby , and I found myself in a large room with an enormous picture stretching across the whole of one wall , and under the picture a counter , and behind the counter divers chappies in white , serving drinks . They have barmen , do n't you know , in New York , not barmaids . Rum idea ! I put myself unreservedly into the hands of one of the white chappies . He was a friendly soul , and I told him the whole state of affairs . I asked him what he thought would meet the case . He said that in a situation of that sort he usually prescribed a 'lightning whizzer ' , an invention of his own . He said this was what rabbits trained on when they were matched against grizzly bears , and there was only one instance on record of the bear having lasted three rounds . So I tried a couple , and , by Jove ! the man was perfectly right . As I drained the second a great load seemed to fall from my heart , and I went out in quite a braced way to have a look at the city . I was surprised to find the streets quite full . People were bustling along as if it were some reasonable hour and not the grey dawn . In the tramcars they were absolutely standing on each other 's necks . Going to business or something , I take it . Wonderful johnnies ! The odd part of it was that after the first shock of seeing all this frightful energy the thing did n't seem so strange . I 've spoken to fellows since who have been to New York , and they tell me they found it just the same . Apparently there 's something in the air , either the ozone or the phosphates or something , which makes you sit up and take notice . A kind of zip , as it were . A sort of bally freedom , if you know what I mean , that gets into your blood and bucks you up , and makes you feel that -- _God 's in His Heaven : All 's right with the world_ , and you do n't care if you 've got odd socks on . I ca n't express it better than by saying that the thought uppermost in my mind , as I walked about the place they call Times Square , was that there were three thousand miles of deep water between me and my Aunt Agatha . It 's a funny thing about looking for things . If you hunt for a needle in a haystack you do n't find it . If you do n't give a darn whether you ever see the needle or not it runs into you the first time you lean against the stack . By the time I had strolled up and down once or twice , seeing the sights and letting the white chappie 's corrective permeate my system , I was feeling that I would n't care if Gussie and I never met again , and I 'm dashed if I did n't suddenly catch sight of the old lad , as large as life , just turning in at a doorway down the street . I called after him , but he did n't hear me , so I legged it in pursuit and caught him going into an office on the first floor . The name on the door was Abe Riesbitter , Vaudeville Agent , and from the other side of the door came the sound of many voices . He turned and stared at me . 'Bertie ! What on earth are you doing ? Where have you sprung from ? When did you arrive ? ' 'Landed this morning . I went round to your hotel , but they said you were n't there . They had never heard of you . ' ' I 've changed my name . I call myself George Wilson . ' 'Why on earth ? ' 'Well , you try calling yourself Augustus Mannering-Phipps over here , and see how it strikes you . You feel a perfect ass . I do n't know what it is about America , but the broad fact is that it 's not a place where you can call yourself Augustus Mannering-Phipps . And there 's another reason . I 'll tell you later . Bertie , I 've fallen in love with the dearest girl in the world . ' The poor old nut looked at me in such a deuced cat-like way , standing with his mouth open , waiting to be congratulated , that I simply hadn't the heart to tell him that I knew all about that already , and had come over to the country for the express purpose of laying him a stymie . So I congratulated him . 'Thanks awfully , old man , ' he said . 'It 's a bit premature , but I fancy it 's going to be all right . Come along in here , and I 'll tell you about it . ' 'What do you want in this place ? It looks a rummy spot . ' 'Oh , that 's part of the story . I 'll tell you the whole thing . ' We opened the door marked 'Waiting Room ' . I never saw such a crowded place in my life . The room was packed till the walls bulged . Gussie explained . 'Pros , ' he said , 'music-hall artistes , you know , waiting to see old Abe Riesbitter . This is September the first , vaudeville 's opening day . The early fall , ' said Gussie , who is a bit of a poet in his way , 'is vaudeville 's springtime . All over the country , as August wanes , sparkling comediennes burst into bloom , the sap stirs in the veins of tramp cyclists , and last year 's contortionists , waking from their summer sleep , tie themselves tentatively into knots . What I mean is , this is the beginning of the new season , and everybody 's out hunting for bookings . ' 'But what do you want here ? ' 'Oh , I 've just got to see Abe about something . If you see a fat man with about fifty-seven chins come out of that door there grab him , for that 'll be Abe . He 's one of those fellows who advertise each step up they take in the world by growing another chin . I 'm told that way back in the nineties he only had two . If you do grab Abe , remember that he knows me as George Wilson . ' 'You said that you were going to explain that George Wilson business to me , Gussie , old man . ' 'Well , it 's this way -- ' At this juncture dear old Gussie broke off short , rose from his seat , and sprang with indescribable vim at an extraordinarily stout chappie who had suddenly appeared . There was the deuce of a rush for him , but Gussie had got away to a good start , and the rest of the singers , dancers , jugglers , acrobats , and refined sketch teams seemed to recognize that he had won the trick , for they ebbed back into their places again , and Gussie and I went into the inner room . Mr Riesbitter lit a cigar , and looked at us solemnly over his zareba of chins . 'Now , let me tell ya something , ' he said to Gussie . 'You lizzun t ' me . ' Gussie registered respectful attention . Mr Riesbitter mused for a moment and shelled the cuspidor with indirect fire over the edge of the desk . 'Lizzun t ' me , ' he said again . ' I seen you rehearse , as I promised Miss Denison I would . You ai n't bad for an amateur . You got ta lot to learn , but it 's in you . What it comes to is that I can fix you up in the four-a-day , if you 'll take thirty-five per . I ca n't do better than that , and I would n't have done that if the little lady had n't of kep' after me . Take it or leave it . What do you say ? ' ' I 'll take it , ' said Gussie , huskily . 'Thank you . ' In the passage outside , Gussie gurgled with joy and slapped me on the back . 'Bertie , old man , it 's all right . I 'm the happiest man in New York . ' 'Now what ? ' 'Well , you see , as I was telling you when Abe came in , Ray 's father used to be in the profession . He was before our time , but I remember hearing about him -- Joe Danby . He used to be well known in London before he came over to America . Well , he 's a fine old boy , but as obstinate as a mule , and he did n't like the idea of Ray marrying me because I wasn't in the profession . Would n't hear of it . Well , you remember at Oxford I could always sing a song pretty well ; so Ray got hold of old Riesbitter and made him promise to come and hear me rehearse and get me bookings if he liked my work . She stands high with him . She coached me for weeks , the darling . And now , as you heard him say , he 's booked me in the small time at thirty-five dollars a week . ' I steadied myself against the wall . The effects of the restoratives supplied by my pal at the hotel bar were beginning to work off , and I felt a little weak . Through a sort of mist I seemed to have a vision of Aunt Agatha hearing that the head of the Mannering-Phippses was about to appear on the vaudeville stage . Aunt Agatha 's worship of the family name amounts to an obsession . The Mannering-Phippses were an old-established clan when William the Conqueror was a small boy going round with bare legs and a catapult . For centuries they have called kings by their first names and helped dukes with their weekly rent ; and there 's practically nothing a Mannering-Phipps can do that does n't blot his escutcheon . So what Aunt Agatha would say -- beyond saying that it was all my fault -- when she learned the horrid news , it was beyond me to imagine . 'Come back to the hotel , Gussie , ' I said . 'There 's a sportsman there who mixes things he calls `` lightning whizzers '' . Something tells me I need one now . And excuse me for one minute , Gussie . I want to send a cable . ' It was clear to me by now that Aunt Agatha had picked the wrong man for this job of disentangling Gussie from the clutches of the American vaudeville profession . What I needed was reinforcements . For a moment I thought of cabling Aunt Agatha to come over , but reason told me that this would be overdoing it . I wanted assistance , but not so badly as that . I hit what seemed to me the happy mean . I cabled to Gussie's mother and made it urgent . 'What were you cabling about ? ' asked Gussie , later . 'Oh just to say I had arrived safely , and all that sort of tosh , ' I answered . * * * * * Gussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at a rummy sort of place uptown where they had moving pictures some of the time and , in between , one or two vaudeville acts . It had taken a lot of careful handling to bring him up to scratch . He seemed to take my sympathy and assistance for granted , and I could n't let him down . My only hope , which grew as I listened to him rehearsing , was that he would be such a frightful frost at his first appearance that he would never dare to perform again ; and , as that would automatically squash the marriage , it seemed best to me to let the thing go on . He was n't taking any chances . On the Saturday and Sunday we practically lived in a beastly little music-room at the offices of the publishers whose songs he proposed to use . A little chappie with a hooked nose sucked a cigarette and played the piano all day . Nothing could tire that lad . He seemed to take a personal interest in the thing . Gussie would cleat his throat and begin : 'There 's a great big choo-choo waiting at the deepo . ' THE CHAPPIE ( playing chords ) : 'Is that so ? What 's it waiting for ? ' GUSSIE ( rather rattled at the interruption ) : 'Waiting for me . ' THE CHAPPIE ( surprised ) : For you ? ' GUSSIE ( sticking to it ) : 'Waiting for me-e-ee ! ' THE CHAPPIE ( sceptically ) : 'You do n't say ! ' GUSSIE : 'For I 'm off to Tennessee . ' THE CHAPPIE ( conceding a point ) : 'Now , I live at Yonkers . ' He did this all through the song . At first poor old Gussie asked him to stop , but the chappie said , No , it was always done . It helped to get pep into the thing . He appealed to me whether the thing did n't want a bit of pep , and I said it wanted all the pep it could get . And the chappie said to Gussie , 'There you are ! ' So Gussie had to stand it . The other song that he intended to sing was one of those moon songs . He told me in a hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of the songs that the girl Ray sang when lifting them out of their seats at Mosenstein 's and elsewhere . The fact seemed to give it sacred associations for him . You will scarcely believe me , but the management expected Gussie to show up and start performing at one o'clock in the afternoon . I told him they could n't be serious , as they must know that he would be rolling out for a bit of lunch at that hour , but Gussie said this was the usual thing in the four-a-day , and he did n't suppose he would ever get any lunch again until he landed on the big time . I was just condoling with him , when I found that he was taking it for granted that I should be there at one o'clock , too . My idea had been that I should look in at night , when -- if he survived -- he would be coming up for the fourth time ; but I 've never deserted a pal in distress , so I said good-bye to the little lunch I 'd been planning at a rather decent tavern I 'd discovered on Fifth Avenue , and trailed along . They were showing pictures when I reached my seat . It was one of those Western films , where the cowboy jumps on his horse and rides across country at a hundred and fifty miles an hour to escape the sheriff , not knowing , poor chump ! that he might just as well stay where he is , the sheriff having a horse of his own which can do three hundred miles an hour without coughing . I was just going to close my eyes and try to forget till they put Gussie 's name up when I discovered that I was sitting next to a deucedly pretty girl . No , let me be honest . When I went in I had seen that there was a deucedly pretty girl sitting in that particular seat , so I had taken the next one . What happened now was that I began , as it were , to drink her in . I wished they would turn the lights up so that I could see her better . She was rather small , with great big eyes and a ripping smile . It was a shame to let all that run to seed , so to speak , in semi-darkness . Suddenly the lights did go up , and the orchestra began to play a tune which , though I have n't much of an ear for music , seemed somehow familiar . The next instant out pranced old Gussie from the wings in a purple frock-coat and a brown top-hat , grinned feebly at the audience , tripped over his feet , blushed , and began to sing the Tennessee song . It was rotten . The poor nut had got stage fright so badly that it practically eliminated his voice . He sounded like some far-off echo of the past 'yodelling ' through a woollen blanket . For the first time since I had heard that he was about to go into vaudeville I felt a faint hope creeping over me . I was sorry for the wretched chap , of course , but there was no denying that the thing had its bright side . No management on earth would go on paying thirty-five dollars a week for this sort of performance . This was going to be Gussie 's first and only . He would have to leave the profession . The old boy would say , 'Unhand my daughter ' . And , with decent luck , I saw myself leading Gussie on to the next England-bound liner and handing him over intact to Aunt Agatha . He got through the song somehow and limped off amidst roars of silence from the audience . There was a brief respite , then out he came again . He sang this time as if nobody loved him . As a song , it was not a very pathetic song , being all about coons spooning in June under the moon , and so on and so forth , but Gussie handled it in such a sad , crushed way that there was genuine anguish in every line . By the time he reached the refrain I was nearly in tears . It seemed such a rotten sort of world with all that kind of thing going on in it . He started the refrain , and then the most frightful thing happened . The girl next to me got up in her seat , chucked her head back , and began to sing too . I say 'too ' , but it was n't really too , because her first note stopped Gussie dead , as if he had been pole-axed . I never felt so bally conspicuous in my life . I huddled down in my seat and wished I could turn my collar up . Everybody seemed to be looking at me . In the midst of my agony I caught sight of Gussie . A complete change had taken place in the old lad . He was looking most frightfully bucked . I must say the girl was singing most awfully well , and it seemed to act on Gussie like a tonic . When she came to the end of the refrain , he took it up , and they sang it together , and the end of it was that he went off the popular hero . The audience yelled for more , and were only quieted when they turned down the lights and put on a film . When I had recovered I tottered round to see Gussie . I found him sitting on a box behind the stage , looking like one who had seen visions . 'Is n't she a wonder , Bertie ? ' he said , devoutly . ' I had n't a notion she was going to be there . She 's playing at the Auditorium this week , and she can only just have had time to get back to her _matinee_ . She risked being late , just to come and see me through . She 's my good angel , Bertie . She saved me . If she had n't helped me out I do n't know what would have happened . I was so nervous I did n't know what I was doing . Now that I 've got through the first show I shall be all right . ' I was glad I had sent that cable to his mother . I was going to need her . The thing had got beyond me . * * * * * During the next week I saw a lot of old Gussie , and was introduced to the girl . I also met her father , a formidable old boy with quick eyebrows and a sort of determined expression . On the following Wednesday Aunt Julia arrived . Mrs Mannering-Phipps , my aunt Julia , is , I think , the most dignified person I know . She lacks Aunt Agatha's punch , but in a quiet way she has always contrived to make me feel , from boyhood up , that I was a poor worm . Not that she harries me like Aunt Agatha . The difference between the two is that Aunt Agatha conveys the impression that she considers me personally responsible for all the sin and sorrow in the world , while Aunt Julia 's manner seems to suggest that I am more to be pitied than censured . If it was n't that the thing was a matter of historical fact , I should be inclined to believe that Aunt Julia had never been on the vaudeville stage . She is like a stage duchess . She always seems to me to be in a perpetual state of being about to desire the butler to instruct the head footman to serve lunch in the blue-room overlooking the west terrace . She exudes dignity . Yet , twenty-five years ago , so I 've been told by old boys who were lads about town in those days , she was knocking them cold at the Tivoli in a double act called 'Fun in a Tea-Shop ' , in which she wore tights and sang a song with a chorus that began , 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay ' . There are some things a chappie 's mind absolutely refuses to picture , and Aunt Julia singing 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay ' is one of them . She got straight to the point within five minutes of our meeting . 'What is this about Gussie ? Why did you cable for me , Bertie ? ' 'It 's rather a long story , ' I said , 'and complicated . If you don't mind , I 'll let you have it in a series of motion pictures . Suppose we look in at the Auditorium for a few minutes . ' The girl , Ray , had been re-engaged for a second week at the Auditorium , owing to the big success of her first week . Her act consisted of three songs . She did herself well in the matter of costume and scenery . She had a ripping voice . She looked most awfully pretty ; and altogether the act was , broadly speaking , a pippin . Aunt Julia did n't speak till we were in our seats . Then she gave a sort of sigh . 'It 's twenty-five years since I was in a music-hall ! ' She did n't say any more , but sat there with her eyes glued on the stage . After about half an hour the johnnies who work the card-index system at the side of the stage put up the name of Ray Denison , and there was a good deal of applause . 'Watch this act , Aunt Julia , ' I said . She did n't seem to hear me . 'Twenty-five years ! What did you say , Bertie ? ' 'Watch this act and tell me what you think of it . ' 'Who is it ? Ray . Oh ! ' 'Exhibit A , ' I said . 'The girl Gussie 's engaged to . ' The girl did her act , and the house rose at her . They did n't want to let her go . She had to come back again and again . When she had finally disappeared I turned to Aunt Julia . 'Well ? ' I said . ' I like her work . She 's an artist . ' 'We will now , if you do n't mind , step a goodish way uptown . ' And we took the subway to where Gussie , the human film , was earning his thirty-five per . As luck would have it , we had n't been in the place ten minutes when out he came . 'Exhibit B , ' I said . 'Gussie . ' I do n't quite know what I had expected her to do , but I certainly did n't expect her to sit there without a word . She did not move a muscle , but just stared at Gussie as he drooled on about the moon . I was sorry for the woman , for it must have been a shock to her to see her only son in a mauve frockcoat and a brown top-hat , but I thought it best to let her get a strangle-hold on the intricacies of the situation as quickly as possible . If I had tried to explain the affair without the aid of illustrations I should have talked all day and left her muddled up as to who was going to marry whom , and why . I was astonished at the improvement in dear old Gussie . He had got back his voice and was putting the stuff over well . It reminded me of the night at Oxford when , then but a lad of eighteen , he sang 'Let 's All Go Down the Strand ' after a bump supper , standing the while up to his knees in the college fountain . He was putting just the same zip into the thing now . When he had gone off Aunt Julia sat perfectly still for a long time , and then she turned to me . Her eyes shone queerly . 'What does this mean , Bertie ? ' She spoke quite quietly , but her voice shook a bit . 'Gussie went into the business , ' I said , 'because the girl 's father would n't let him marry her unless he did . If you feel up to it perhaps you would n't mind tottering round to One Hundred and Thirty-third Street and having a chat with him . He 's an old boy with eyebrows , and he 's Exhibit C on my list . When I 've put you in touch with him I rather fancy my share of the business is concluded , and it 's up to you . ' The Danbys lived in one of those big apartments uptown which look as if they cost the earth and really cost about half as much as a hall-room down in the forties . We were shown into the sitting-room , and presently old Danby came in . 'Good afternoon , Mr Danby , ' I began . I had got as far as that when there was a kind of gasping cry at my elbow . 'Joe ! ' cried Aunt Julia , and staggered against the sofa . For a moment old Danby stared at her , and then his mouth fell open and his eyebrows shot up like rockets . 'Julie ! ' And then they had got hold of each other 's hands and were shaking them till I wondered their arms did n't come unscrewed . I 'm not equal to this sort of thing at such short notice . The change in Aunt Julia made me feel quite dizzy . She had shed her _grande-dame_ manner completely , and was blushing and smiling . I do n't like to say such things of any aunt of mine , or I would go further and put it on record that she was giggling . And old Danby , who usually looked like a cross between a Roman emperor and Napoleon Bonaparte in a bad temper , was behaving like a small boy . 'Joe ! ' 'Julie ! ' 'Dear old Joe ! Fancy meeting you again ! ' 'Wherever have you come from , Julie ? ' Well , I did n't know what it was all about , but I felt a bit out of it . I butted in : 'Aunt Julia wants to have a talk with you , Mr Danby . ' ' I knew you in a second , Joe ! ' 'It 's twenty-five years since I saw you , kid , and you do n't look a day older . ' 'Oh , Joe ! I 'm an old woman ! ' 'What are you doing over here ? I suppose ' -- old Danby 's cheerfulness waned a trifle -- ' I suppose your husband is with you ? ' 'My husband died a long , long while ago , Joe . ' Old Danby shook his head . 'You never ought to have married out of the profession , Julie . I'm not saying a word against the late -- I ca n't remember his name ; never could -- but you should n't have done it , an artist like you . Shall I ever forget the way you used to knock them with `` Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay '' ? ' 'Ah ! how wonderful you were in that act , Joe . ' Aunt Julia sighed . 'Do you remember the back-fall you used to do down the steps ? I always have said that you did the best back-fall in the profession . ' ' I could n't do it now ! ' 'Do you remember how we put it across at the Canterbury , Joe ? Think of it ! The Canterbury 's a moving-picture house now , and the old Mogul runs French revues . ' ' I 'm glad I 'm not there to see them . ' 'Joe , tell me , why did you leave England ? ' 'Well , I -- I wanted a change . No I 'll tell you the truth , kid . I wanted you , Julie . You went off and married that -- whatever that stage-door johnny 's name was -- and it broke me all up . ' Aunt Julia was staring at him . She is what they call a well-preserved woman . It 's easy to see that , twenty-five years ago , she must have been something quite extraordinary to look at . Even now she 's almost beautiful . She has very large brown eyes , a mass of soft grey hair , and the complexion of a girl of seventeen . 'Joe , you are n't going to tell me you were fond of me yourself ! ' 'Of course I was fond of you . Why did I let you have all the fat in '' Fun in a Tea-Shop '' ? Why did I hang about upstage while you sang '' Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay '' ? Do you remember my giving you a bag of buns when we were on the road at Bristol ? ' 'Yes , but -- ' 'Do you remember my giving you the ham sandwiches at Portsmouth ? ' 'Joe ! ' 'Do you remember my giving you a seed-cake at Birmingham ? What did you think all that meant , if not that I loved you ? Why , I was working up by degrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly went off and married that cane-sucking dude . That 's why I would n't let my daughter marry this young chap , Wilson , unless he went into the profession . She 's an artist -- ' 'She certainly is , Joe . ' 'You 've seen her ? Where ? ' 'At the Auditorium just now . But , Joe , you must n't stand in the way of her marrying the man she 's in love with . He 's an artist , too . ' 'In the small time . ' 'You were in the small time once , Joe . You must n't look down on him because he 's a beginner . I know you feel that your daughter is marrying beneath her , but -- ' 'How on earth do you know anything about young Wilson ? 'He 's my son . ' 'Your son ? ' 'Yes , Joe . And I 've just been watching him work . Oh , Joe , you can't think how proud I was of him ! He 's got it in him . It 's fate . He 's my son and he 's in the profession ! Joe , you do n't know what I 've been through for his sake . They made a lady of me . I never worked so hard in my life as I did to become a real lady . They kept telling me I had got to put it across , no matter what it cost , so that he would n't be ashamed of me . The study was something terrible . I had to watch myself every minute for years , and I never knew when I might fluff my lines or fall down on some bit of business . But I did it , because I did n't want him to be ashamed of me , though all the time I was just aching to be back where I belonged . ' Old Danby made a jump at her , and took her by the shoulders . 'Come back where you belong , Julie ! ' he cried . 'Your husband 's dead , your son 's a pro . Come back ! It 's twenty-five years ago , but I haven't changed . I want you still . I 've always wanted you . You 've got to come back , kid , where you belong . ' Aunt Julia gave a sort of gulp and looked at him . 'Joe ! ' she said in a kind of whisper . 'You 're here , kid , ' said Old Danby , huskily . 'You 've come back .... Twenty-five years ! ... You 've come back and you 're going to stay ! ' She pitched forward into his arms , and he caught her . 'Oh , Joe ! Joe ! Joe ! ' she said . 'Hold me . Do n't let me go . Take care of me . ' And I edged for the door and slipped from the room . I felt weak . The old bean will stand a certain amount , but this was too much . I groped my way out into the street and wailed for a taxi . Gussie called on me at the hotel that night . He curveted into the room as if he had bought it and the rest of the city . 'Bertie , ' he said , ' I feel as if I were dreaming . ' ' I wish I could feel like that , old top , ' I said , and I took another glance at a cable that had arrived half an hour ago from Aunt Agatha . I had been looking at it at intervals ever since . 'Ray and I got back to her flat this evening . Who do you think was there ? The mater ! She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby . ' 'Yes ? ' 'He was sitting hand in hand with her . ' 'Really ? ' 'They are going to be married . ' 'Exactly . ' 'Ray and I are going to be married . ' ' I suppose so . ' 'Bertie , old man , I feel immense . I look round me , and everything seems to be absolutely corking . The change in the mater is marvellous . She is twenty-five years younger . She and old Danby are talking of reviving '' Fun in a Tea-Shop '' , and going out on the road with it . ' I got up . 'Gussie , old top , ' I said , 'leave me for a while . I would be alone . I think I 've got brain fever or something . ' 'Sorry , old man ; perhaps New York does n't agree with you . When do you expect to go back to England ? ' I looked again at Aunt Agatha 's cable . 'With luck , ' I said , 'in about ten years . ' When he was gone I took up the cable and read it again . 'What is happening ? ' it read . 'Shall I come over ? ' I sucked a pencil for a while , and then I wrote the reply . It was not an easy cable to word , but I managed it . 'No , ' I wrote , 'stay where you are . Profession overcrowded . ' WILTON 'S HOLIDAY When Jack Wilton first came to Marois Bay , none of us dreamed that he was a man with a hidden sorrow in his life . There was something about the man which made the idea absurd , or would have made it absurd if he himself had not been the authority for the story . He looked so thoroughly pleased with life and with himself . He was one of those men whom you instinctively label in your mind as 'strong ' . He was so healthy , so fit , and had such a confident , yet sympathetic , look about him that you felt directly you saw him that here was the one person you would have selected as the recipient of that hard-luck story of yours . You felt that his kindly strength would have been something to lean on . As a matter of fact , it was by trying to lean on it that Spencer Clay got hold of the facts of the case ; and when young Clay got hold of anything , Marois Bay at large had it hot and fresh a few hours later ; for Spencer was one of those slack-jawed youths who are constitutionally incapable of preserving a secret . Within two hours , then , of Clay 's chat with Wilton , everyone in the place knew that , jolly and hearty as the new-comer might seem , there was that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply heroic . Clay , it seems , who is the worst specimen of self-pitier , had gone to Wilton , in whom , as a new-comer , he naturally saw a fine fresh repository for his tales of woe , and had opened with a long yarn of some misfortune or other . I forget which it was ; it might have been any one of a dozen or so which he had constantly in stock , and it is immaterial which it was . The point is that , having heard him out very politely and patiently , Wilton came back at him with a story which silenced even Clay . Spencer was equal to most things , but even he could not go on whining about how he had foozled his putting and been snubbed at the bridge-table , or whatever it was that he was pitying himself about just then , when a man was telling him the story of a wrecked life . 'He told me not to let it go any further , ' said Clay to everyone he met , 'but of course it does n't matter telling you . It is a thing he does n't like to have known . He told me because he said there was something about me that seemed to extract confidences -- a kind of strength , he said . You would n't think it to look at him , but his life is an absolute blank . Absolutely ruined , do n't you know . He told me the whole thing so simply and frankly that it broke me all up . It seems that he was engaged to be married a few years ago , and on the wedding morning -- absolutely on the wedding morning -- the girl was taken suddenly ill , and -- ' 'And died ? ' 'And died . Died in his arms . Absolutely in his arms , old top . ' 'What a terrible thing ! ' 'Absolutely . He 's never got over it . You wo n't let it go any further , will you old man ? ' And off sped Spencer , to tell the tale to someone else . * * * * * Everyone was terribly sorry for Wilton . He was such a good fellow , such a sportsman , and , above all , so young , that one hated the thought that , laugh as he might , beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that awful memory . He seemed so happy , too . It was only in moments of confidence , in those heart-to-heart talks when men reveal their deeper feelings , that he ever gave a hint that all was not well with him . As , for example , when Ellerton , who is always in love with someone , backed him into a corner one evening and began to tell him the story of his latest affair , he had hardly begun when such a look of pain came over Wilton 's face that he ceased instantly . He said afterwards that the sudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like a bullet , and the manner in which he turned the conversation practically without pausing from love to a discussion of the best method of getting out of the bunker at the seventh hole was , in the circumstances , a triumph of tact . Marois Bay is a quiet place even in the summer , and the Wilton tragedy was naturally the subject of much talk . It is a sobering thing to get a glimpse of the underlying sadness of life like that , and there was a disposition at first on the part of the community to behave in his presence in a manner reminiscent of pall-bearers at a funeral . But things soon adjusted themselves . He was outwardly so cheerful that it seemed ridiculous for the rest of us to step softly and speak with hushed voices . After all , when you came to examine it , the thing was his affair , and it was for him to dictate the lines on which it should be treated . If he elected to hide his pain under a bright smile and a laugh like that of a hyena with a more than usually keen sense of humour , our line was obviously to follow his lead . We did so ; and by degrees the fact that his life was permanently blighted became almost a legend . At the back of our minds we were aware of it , but it did not obtrude itself into the affairs of every day . It was only when someone , forgetting , as Ellerton had done , tried to enlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the look of pain in his eyes and the sudden tightening of his lips reminded us that he still remembered . Matters had been at this stage for perhaps two weeks when Mary Campbell arrived . Sex attraction is so purely a question of the taste of the individual that the wise man never argues about it . He accepts its vagaries as part of the human mystery , and leaves it at that . To me there was no charm whatever about Mary Campbell . It may have been that , at the moment , I was in love with Grace Bates , Heloise Miller , and Clarice Wembley -- for at Marois Bay , in the summer , a man who is worth his salt is more than equal to three love affairs simultaneously -- but anyway , she left me cold . Not one thrill could she awake in me . She was small and , to my mind , insignificant . Some men said that she had fine eyes . They seemed to me just ordinary eyes . And her hair was just ordinary hair . In fact , ordinary was the word that described her . But from the first it was plain that she seemed wonderful with Wilton , which was all the more remarkable , seeing that he was the one man of us all who could have got any girl in Marois Bay that he wanted . When a man is six foot high , is a combination of Hercules and Apollo , and plays tennis , golf , and the banjo with almost superhuman vim , his path with the girls of a summer seaside resort is pretty smooth . But , when you add to all these things a tragedy like Wilton 's , he can only be described as having a walk-over . Girls love a tragedy . At least , most girls do . It makes a man interesting to them . Grace Bates was always going on about how interesting Wilton was . So was Heloise Miller . So was Clarice Wembley . But it was not until Mary Campbell came that he displayed any real enthusiasm at all for the feminine element of Marois Bay . We put it down to the fact that he could not forget , but the real reason , I now know , was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links and in the tennis-court . I suppose a plus two golfer and a Wildingesque tennis-player , such as Wilton was , does feel like that . Personally , I think that girls add to the fun of the thing . But then , my handicap is twelve , and , though I have been playing tennis for many years , I doubt if I have got my first serve -- the fast one -- over the net more than half a dozen times . But Mary Campbell overcame Wilton 's prejudices in twenty-four hours . He seemed to feel lonely on the links without her , and he positively egged her to be his partner in the doubles . What Mary thought of him we did not know . She was one of those inscrutable girls . And so things went on . If it had not been that I knew Wilton 's story , I should have classed the thing as one of those summer love-affairs to which the Marois Bay air is so peculiarly conducive . The only reason why anyone comes away from a summer at Marois Bay unbetrothed is because there are so many girls that he falls in love with that his holiday is up before he can , so to speak , concentrate . But in Wilton 's case this was out of the question . A man does not get over the sort of blow he had had , not , at any rate , for many years : and we had gathered that his tragedy was comparatively recent . I doubt if I was ever more astonished in my life than the night when he confided in me . Why he should have chosen me as a confidant I can not say . I am inclined to think that I happened to be alone with him at the psychological moment when a man must confide in somebody or burst ; and Wilton chose the lesser evil . I was strolling along the shore after dinner , smoking a cigar and thinking of Grace Bates , Heloise Miller , and Clarice Wembley , when I happened upon him . It was a beautiful night , and we sat down and drank it in for a while . The first intimation I had that all was not well with him was when he suddenly emitted a hollow groan . The next moment he had begun to confide . ' I 'm in the deuce of a hole , ' he said . 'What would you do in my position ? ' 'Yes ? ' I said . ' I proposed to Mary Campbell this evening . ' 'Congratulations . ' 'Thanks . She refused me . ' 'Refused you ! ' 'Yes -- because of Amy . ' It seemed to me that the narrative required footnotes . 'Who is Amy ? ' I said . 'Amy is the girl -- ' 'Which girl ? ' 'The girl who died , you know . Mary had got hold of the whole story . In fact , it was the tremendous sympathy she showed that encouraged me to propose . If it had n't been for that , I should n't have had the nerve . I 'm not fit to black her shoes . ' Odd , the poor opinion a man always has -- when he is in love -- of his personal attractions . There were times when I thought of Grace Bates , Heloise Miller , and Clarice Wembley , when I felt like one of the beasts that perish . But then , I 'm nothing to write home about , whereas the smallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was a kind of Ouida guardsman . 'This evening I managed somehow to do it . She was tremendously nice about it -- said she was very fond of me and all that -- but it was quite out of the question because of Amy . ' ' I do n't follow this . What did she mean ? ' 'It 's perfectly clear , if you bear in mind that Mary is the most sensitive , spiritual , highly strung girl that ever drew breath , ' said Wilton , a little coldly . 'Her position is this : she feels that , because of Amy , she can never have my love completely ; between us there would always be Amy 's memory . It would be the same as if she married a widower . ' 'Well , widowers marry . ' 'They do n't marry girls like Mary . ' I could n't help feeling that this was a bit of luck for the widowers ; but I did n't say so . One has always got to remember that opinions differ about girls . One man 's peach , so to speak , is another man's poison . I have met men who did n't like Grace Bates , men who , if Heloise Miller or Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs , would have used them to cut the pages of a novel . 'Amy stands between us , ' said Wilton . I breathed a sympathetic snort . I could n't think of anything noticeably suitable to say . 'Stands between us , ' repeated Wilton . 'And the damn silly part of the whole thing is that there is n't any Amy . I invented her . ' 'You -- what ! ' 'Invented her . Made her up . No , I 'm not mad . I had a reason . Let me see , you come from London , do n't you ? ' 'Yes . ' 'Then you have n't any friends . It 's different with me . I live in a small country town , and everyone 's my friend . I do n't know what it is about me , but for some reason , ever since I can remember , I 've been looked on as the strong man of my town , the man who 's _all right_ . Am I making myself clear ? ' 'Not quite . ' 'Well , what I am trying to get at is this . Either because I 'm a strong sort of fellow to look at , and have obviously never been sick in my life , or because I ca n't help looking pretty cheerful , the whole of Bridley-in-the-Wold seems to take it for granted that I ca n't possibly have any troubles of my own , and that I am consequently fair game for anyone who has any sort of worry . I have the sympathetic manner , and they come to me to be cheered up . If a fellow 's in love , he makes a bee-line for me , and tells me all about it . If anyone has had a bereavement , I am the rock on which he leans for support . Well , I 'm a patient sort of man , and , as far as Bridley-in-the-Wold is concerned , I am willing to play the part . But a strong man does need an occasional holiday , and I made up my mind that I would get it . Directly I got here I saw that the same old game was going to start . Spencer Clay swooped down on me at once . I 'm as big a draw with the Spencer Clay type of maudlin idiot as catnip is with a cat . Well , I could stand it at home , but I was hanged if I was going to have my holiday spoiled . So I invented Amy . Now do you see ? ' 'Certainly I see . And I perceive something else which you appear to have overlooked . If Amy does n't exist -- or , rather , never did exist -- she can not stand between you and Miss Campbell . Tell her what you have told me , and all will be well . ' He shook his head . 'You do n't know Mary . She would never forgive me . You do n't know what sympathy , what angelic sympathy , she has poured out on me about Amy . I ca n't possibly tell her the whole thing was a fraud . It would make her feel so foolish . ' 'You must risk it . At the worst , you lose nothing . ' He brightened a little . 'No , that 's true , ' he said . ' I 've half a mind to do it . ' 'Make it a whole mind , ' I said , 'and you win out . ' I was wrong . Sometimes I am . The trouble was , apparently , that I didn't know Mary . I am sure Grace Bates , Heloise Miller , or Clarice Wembley would not have acted as she did . They might have been a trifle stunned at first , but they would soon have come round , and all would have been joy . But with Mary , no . What took place at the interview I do not know ; but it was swiftly perceived by Marois Bay that the Wilton-Campbell alliance was off . They no longer walked together , golfed together , and played tennis on the same side of the net . They did not even speak to each other . * * * * * The rest of the story I can speak of only from hearsay . How it became public property , I do not know . But there was a confiding strain in Wilton , and I imagine he confided in someone , who confided in someone else . At any rate , it is recorded in Marois Bay 's unwritten archives , from which I now extract it . * * * * * For some days after the breaking-off of diplomatic relations , Wilton seemed too pulverized to resume the offensive . He mooned about the links by himself , playing a shocking game , and generally comported himself like a man who has looked for the escape of gas with a lighted candle . In affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the most spineless lack of resolution . Wilton weighed thirteen stone , and his muscles were like steel cables ; but he could not have shown less pluck in this crisis in his life if he had been a poached egg . It was pitiful to see him . Mary , in these days , simply could n't see that he was on the earth . She looked round him , above him , and through him , but never at him ; which was rotten from Wilton 's point of view , for he had developed a sort of wistful expression -- I am convinced that he practised it before the mirror after his bath -- which should have worked wonders , if only he could have got action with it . But she avoided his eye as if he had been a creditor whom she was trying to slide past on the street . She irritated me . To let the breach widen in this way was absurd . Wilton , when I said as much to him , said that it was due to her wonderful sensitiveness and highly strungness , and that it was just one more proof to him of the loftiness of her soul and her shrinking horror of any form of deceit . In fact , he gave me the impression that , though the affair was rending his vitals , he took a mournful pleasure in contemplating her perfection . Now one afternoon Wilton took his misery for a long walk along the seashore . He tramped over the sand for some considerable time , and finally pulled up in a little cove , backed by high cliffs and dotted with rocks . The shore around Marois Bay is full of them . By this time the afternoon sun had begun to be too warm for comfort , and it struck Wilton that he could be a great deal more comfortable nursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than tramping any farther over the sand . Most of the Marois Bay scenery is simply made as a setting for the nursing of a wounded heart . The cliffs are a sombre indigo , sinister and forbidding ; and even on the finest days the sea has a curious sullen look . You have only to get away from the crowd near the bathing-machines and reach one of these small coves and get your book against a rock and your pipe well alight , and you can simply wallow in misery . I have done it myself . The day when Heloise Miller went golfing with Teddy Bingley I spent the whole afternoon in one of these retreats . It is true that , after twenty minutes of contemplating the breakers , I fell asleep ; but that is bound to happen . It happened to Wilton . For perhaps half an hour he brooded , and then his pipe fell from his mouth and he dropped off into a peaceful slumber . And time went by . It was a touch of cramp that finally woke him . He jumped up with a yell , and stood there massaging his calf . And he had hardly got rid of the pain , when a startled exclamation broke the primeval stillness ; and there , on the other side of the rock , was Mary Campbell . Now , if Wilton had had any inductive reasoning in his composition at all , he would have been tremendously elated . A girl does not creep out to a distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy ; and if Mary Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him ; and if she was unhappy about him all he had to do was to show a bit of determination and get the whole thing straightened out . But Wilton , whom grief had reduced to the mental level of an oyster , did not reason this out ; and the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties , including speech . He just stood there and yammered . 'Did you follow me here , Mr Wilton ? ' said Mary , very coldly . He shook his head . Eventually he managed to say that he had come there by chance , and had fallen asleep under the rock . As this was exactly what Mary had done , she could not reasonably complain . So that concluded the conversation for the time being . She walked away in the direction of Marois Bay without another word , and presently he lost sight of her round a bend in the cliffs . His position now was exceedingly unpleasant . If she had such a distaste for his presence , common decency made it imperative that he should give her a good start on the homeward journey . He could not tramp along a couple of yards in the rear all the way . So he had to remain where he was till she had got well off the mark . And as he was wearing a thin flannel suit , and the sun had gone in , and a chilly breeze had sprung up , his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical discomfort . Just as he had decided that he could now make a move , he was surprised to see her coming back . Wilton really was elated at this . The construction he put on it was that she had relented and was coming back to fling her arms round his neck . He was just bracing himself for the clash , when he caught her eye , and it was as cold and unfriendly as the sea . ' I must go round the other way , ' she said . 'The water has come up too far on that side . ' And she walked past him to the other end of the cove . The prospect of another wait chilled Wilton to the marrow . The wind had now grown simply freezing , and it came through his thin suit and roamed about all over him in a manner that caused him exquisite discomfort . He began to jump to keep himself warm . He was leaping heavenwards for the hundredth time , when , chancing to glance to one side , he perceived Mary again returning . By this time his physical misery had so completely overcome the softer emotions in his bosom that his only feeling now was one of thorough irritation . It was not fair , he felt , that she should jockey at the start in this way and keep him hanging about here catching cold . He looked at her , when she came within range , quite balefully . 'It is impossible , ' she said , 'to get round that way either . ' One grows so accustomed in this world to everything going smoothly , that the idea of actual danger had not yet come home to her . From where she stood in the middle of the cove , the sea looked so distant that the fact that it had closed the only ways of getting out was at the moment merely annoying . She felt much the same as she would have felt if she had arrived at a station to catch a train and had been told that the train was not running . She therefore seated herself on a rock , and contemplated the ocean . Wilton walked up and down . Neither showed any disposition to exercise that gift of speech which places Man in a class of his own , above the ox , the ass , the common wart-hog , and the rest of the lower animals . It was only when a wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke the silence . 'The tide is coming _in_ ' she faltered . She looked at the sea with such altered feelings that it seemed a different sea altogether . There was plenty of it to look at . It filled the entire mouth of the little bay , swirling up the sand and lashing among the rocks in a fashion which made one thought stand out above all the others in her mind -- the recollection that she could not swim . 'Mr Wilton ! ' Wilton bowed coldly . 'Mr Wilton , the tide . It 's coming IN . ' Wilton glanced superciliously at the sea . 'So , ' he said , ' I perceive . ' 'But what shall we do ? ' Wilton shrugged his shoulders . He was feeling at war with Nature and Humanity combined . The wind had shifted a few points to the east , and was exploring his anatomy with the skill of a qualified surgeon . 'We shall drown , ' cried Miss Campbell . 'We shall drown . We shall drown . We shall drown . ' All Wilton 's resentment left him . Until he heard that pitiful wail his only thoughts had been for himself . 'Mary ! ' he said , with a wealth of tenderness in his voice . She came to him as a little child comes to its mother , and he put his arm around her . 'Oh , Jack ! ' 'My darling ! ' ' I 'm frightened ! ' 'My precious ! ' It is in moments of peril , when the chill breath of fear blows upon our souls , clearing them of pettiness , that we find ourselves . She looked about her wildly . 'Could we climb the cliffs ? ' ' I doubt it . ' 'If we called for help -- ' 'We could do that . ' They raised their voices , but the only answer was the crashing of the waves and the cry of the sea-birds . The water was swirling at their feet , and they drew back to the shelter of the cliffs . There they stood in silence , watching . 'Mary , ' said Wilton in a low voice , 'tell me one thing . ' 'Yes , Jack ? ' 'Have you forgiven me ? ' 'Forgiven you ! How can you ask at a moment like this ? I love you with all my heart and soul . ' He kissed her , and a strange look of peace came over his face . ' I am happy . ' ' I , too . ' A fleck of foam touched her face , and she shivered . 'It was worth it , ' he said quietly . 'If all misunderstandings are cleared away and nothing can come between us again , it is a small price to pay -- unpleasant as it will be when it comes . ' 'Perhaps -- perhaps it will not be very unpleasant . They say that drowning is an easy death . ' ' I did n't mean drowning , dearest . I meant a cold in the head . ' ' A cold in the head ! ' He nodded gravely . ' I do n't see how it can be avoided . You know how chilly it gets these late summer nights . It will be a long time before we can get away . ' She laughed a shrill , unnatural laugh . 'You are talking like this to keep my courage up . You know in your heart that there is no hope for us . Nothing can save us now . The water will come creeping -- creeping -- ' 'Let it creep ! It ca n't get past that rock there . ' 'What do you mean ? ' 'It ca n't . The tide does n't come up any farther . I know , because I was caught here last week . ' For a moment she looked at him without speaking . Then she uttered a cry in which relief , surprise , and indignation were so nicely blended that it would have been impossible to say which predominated . He was eyeing the approaching waters with an indulgent smile . 'Why did n't you tell me ? ' she cried . ' I did tell you . ' 'You know what I mean . Why did you let me go on thinking we were in danger , when -- ' 'We _were_ in danger . We shall probably get pneumonia . ' 'Isch ! ' 'There ! You 're sneezing already . ' ' I am not sneezing . That was an exclamation of disgust . ' 'It sounded like a sneeze . It must have been , for you 've every reason to sneeze , but why you should utter exclamations of disgust I can not imagine . ' ' I 'm disgusted with you -- with your meanness . You deliberately tricked me into saying -- ' 'Saying -- ' She was silent . 'What you said was that you loved me with all your heart and soul . You ca n't get away from that , and it 's good enough for me . ' 'Well , it 's not true any longer . ' 'Yes , it is , ' said Wilton , comfortably ; 'bless it . ' 'It is not . I 'm going right away now , and I shall never speak to you again . ' She moved away from him , and prepared to sit down . 'There 's a jelly-fish just where you 're going to sit , ' said Wilton . ' I do n't care . ' 'It will . I speak from experience , as one on whom you have sat so often . ' ' I 'm not amused . ' 'Have patience . I can be funnier than that . ' 'Please do n't talk to me . ' 'Very well . ' She seated herself with her back to him . Dignity demanded reprisals , so he seated himself with his back to her ; and the futile ocean raged towards them , and the wind grew chillier every minute . Time passed . Darkness fell . The little bay became a black cavern , dotted here and there with white , where the breeze whipped the surface of the water . Wilton sighed . It was lonely sitting there all by himself . How much jollier it would have been if -- A hand touched his shoulder , and a voice spoke -- meekly . 'Jack , dear , it -- it 's awfully cold . Do n't you think if we were to -- snuggle up -- ' He reached out and folded her in an embrace which would have aroused the professional enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt and drawn guttural congratulations from Zbysco . She creaked , but did not crack , beneath the strain . 'That 's much nicer , ' she said , softly . 'Jack , I do n't think the tide's started even to think of going down yet . ' ' I hope not , ' said Wilton . THE MIXER I . _He Meets a Shy Gentleman_ Looking back , I always consider that my career as a dog proper really started when I was bought for the sum of half a crown by the Shy Man . That event marked the end of my puppyhood . The knowledge that I was worth actual cash to somebody filled me with a sense of new responsibilities . It sobered me . Besides , it was only after that half-crown changed hands that I went out into the great world ; and , however interesting life may be in an East End public-house , it is only when you go out into the world that you really broaden your mind and begin to see things . Within its limitations , my life had been singularly full and vivid . I was born , as I say , in a public-house in the East End , and , however lacking a public-house may be in refinement and the true culture , it certainly provides plenty of excitement . Before I was six weeks old I had upset three policemen by getting between their legs when they came round to the side-door , thinking they had heard suspicious noises ; and I can still recall the interesting sensation of being chased seventeen times round the yard with a broom-handle after a well-planned and completely successful raid on the larder . These and other happenings of a like nature soothed for the moment but could not cure the restlessness which has always been so marked a trait in my character . I have always been restless , unable to settle down in one place and anxious to get on to the next thing . This may be due to a gipsy strain in my ancestry -- one of my uncles travelled with a circus -- or it may be the Artistic Temperament , acquired from a grandfather who , before dying of a surfeit of paste in the property-room of the Bristol Coliseum , which he was visiting in the course of a professional tour , had an established reputation on the music-hall stage as one of Professor Pond 's Performing Poodles . I owe the fullness and variety of my life to this restlessness of mine , for I have repeatedly left comfortable homes in order to follow some perfect stranger who looked as if he were on his way to somewhere interesting . Sometimes I think I must have cat blood in me . The Shy Man came into our yard one afternoon in April , while I was sleeping with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed from Fred , one of the barmen . I heard mother growl , but I did n't take any notice . Mother is what they call a good watch-dog , and she growls at everybody except master . At first , when she used to do it , I would get up and bark my head off , but not now . Life 's too short to bark at everybody who comes into our yard . It is behind the public-house , and they keep empty bottles and things there , so people are always coming and going . Besides , I was tired . I had had a very busy morning , helping the men bring in a lot of cases of beer , and running into the saloon to talk to Fred and generally looking after things . So I was just dozing off again , when I heard a voice say , 'Well , he 's ugly enough ! ' Then I knew that they were talking about me . I have never disguised it from myself , and nobody has ever disguised it from me , that I am not a handsome dog . Even mother never thought me beautiful . She was no Gladys Cooper herself , but she never hesitated to criticize my appearance . In fact , I have yet to meet anyone who did . The first thing strangers say about me is , 'What an ugly dog ! ' I do n't know what I am . I have a bulldog kind of a face , but the rest of me is terrier . I have a long tail which sticks straight up in the air . My hair is wiry . My eyes are brown . I am jet black , with a white chest . I once overheard Fred saying that I was a Gorgonzola cheese-hound , and I have generally found Fred reliable in his statements . When I found that I was under discussion , I opened my eyes . Master was standing there , looking down at me , and by his side the man who had just said I was ugly enough . The man was a thin man , about the age of a barman and smaller than a policeman . He had patched brown shoes and black trousers . 'But he 's got a sweet nature , ' said master . This was true , luckily for me . Mother always said , ' A dog without influence or private means , if he is to make his way in the world , must have either good looks or amiability . ' But , according to her , I overdid it . ' A dog , ' she used to say , 'can have a good heart , without chumming with every Tom , Dick , and Harry he meets . Your behaviour is sometimes quite un-doglike . ' Mother prided herself on being a one-man dog . She kept herself to herself , and would n't kiss anybody except master -- not even Fred . Now , I 'm a mixer . I ca n't help it . It 's my nature . I like men . I like the taste of their boots , the smell of their legs , and the sound of their voices . It may be weak of me , but a man has only to speak to me and a sort of thrill goes right down my spine and sets my tail wagging . I wagged it now . The man looked at me rather distantly . He did n't pat me . I suspected -- what I afterwards found to be the case -- that he was shy , so I jumped up at him to put him at his ease . Mother growled again . I felt that she did not approve . 'Why , he 's took quite a fancy to you already , ' said master . The man did n't say a word . He seemed to be brooding on something . He was one of those silent men . He reminded me of Joe , the old dog down the street at the grocer 's shop , who lies at the door all day , blinking and not speaking to anybody . Master began to talk about me . It surprised me , the way he praised me . I had n't a suspicion he admired me so much . From what he said you would have thought I had won prizes and ribbons at the Crystal Palace . But the man did n't seem to be impressed . He kept on saying nothing . When master had finished telling him what a wonderful dog I was till I blushed , the man spoke . 'Less of it , ' he said . 'Half a crown is my bid , and if he was an angel from on high you could n't get another ha'penny out of me . What about it ? ' A thrill went down my spine and out at my tail , for of course I saw now what was happening . The man wanted to buy me and take me away . I looked at master hopefully . 'He 's more like a son to me than a dog , ' said master , sort of wistful . 'It 's his face that makes you feel that way , ' said the man , unsympathetically . 'If you had a son that 's just how he would look . Half a crown is my offer , and I 'm in a hurry . ' 'All right , ' said master , with a sigh , 'though it 's giving him away , a valuable dog like that . Where 's your half-crown ? ' The man got a bit of rope and tied it round my neck . I could hear mother barking advice and telling me to be a credit to the family , but I was too excited to listen . 'Good-bye , mother , ' I said . 'Good-bye , master . Good-bye , Fred . Good-bye everybody . I 'm off to see life . The Shy Man has bought me for half a crown . Wow ! ' I kept running round in circles and shouting , till the man gave me a kick and told me to stop it . So I did . I do n't know where we went , but it was a long way . I had never been off our street before in my life and I did n't know the whole world was half as big as that . We walked on and on , and the man jerked at my rope whenever I wanted to stop and look at anything . He would n't even let me pass the time of the day with dogs we met . When we had gone about a hundred miles and were just going to turn in at a dark doorway , a policeman suddenly stopped the man . I could feel by the way the man pulled at my rope and tried to hurry on that he did n't want to speak to the policeman . The more I saw of the man the more I saw how shy he was . 'Hi ! ' said the policeman , and we had to stop . ' I 've got a message for you , old pal , ' said the policeman . 'It 's from the Board of Health . They told me to tell you you needed a change of air . See ? ' 'All right ! ' said the man . 'And take it as soon as you like . Else you 'll find you 'll get it given you . See ? ' I looked at the man with a good deal of respect . He was evidently someone very important , if they worried so about his health . ' I 'm going down to the country tonight , ' said the man . The policeman seemed pleased . 'That 's a bit of luck for the country , ' he said . 'Do n't go changing your mind . ' And we walked on , and went in at the dark doorway , and climbed about a million stairs and went into a room that smelt of rats . The man sat down and swore a little , and I sat and looked at him . Presently I could n't keep it in any longer . 'Do we live here ? ' I said . 'Is it true we 're going to the country ? Was n't that policeman a good sort ? Do n't you like policemen ? I knew lots of policemen at the public-house . Are there any other dogs here ? What is there for dinner ? What 's in that cupboard ? When are you going to take me out for another run ? May I go out and see if I can find a cat ? ' 'Stop that yelping , ' he said . 'When we go to the country , where shall we live ? Are you going to be a caretaker at a house ? Fred 's father is a caretaker at a big house in Kent . I 've heard Fred talk about it . You did n't meet Fred when you came to the public-house , did you ? You would like Fred . I like Fred . Mother likes Fred . We all like Fred . ' I was going on to tell him a lot more about Fred , who had always been one of my warmest friends , when he suddenly got hold of a stick and walloped me with it . 'You keep quiet when you 're told , ' he said . He really was the shyest man I had ever met . It seemed to hurt him to be spoken to . However , he was the boss , and I had to humour him , so I did n't say any more . We went down to the country that night , just as the man had told the policeman we would . I was all worked up , for I had heard so much about the country from Fred that I had always wanted to go there . Fred used to go off on a motor-bicycle sometimes to spend the night with his father in Kent , and once he brought back a squirrel with him , which I thought was for me to eat , but mother said no . 'The first thing a dog has to learn , ' mother used often to say , 'is that the whole world was n't created for him to eat . ' It was quite dark when we got to the country , but the man seemed to know where to go . He pulled at my rope , and we began to walk along a road with no people in it at all . We walked on and on , but it was all so new to me that I forgot how tired I was . I could feel my mind broadening with every step I took . Every now and then we would pass a very big house , which looked as if it was empty , but I knew that there was a caretaker inside , because of Fred 's father . These big houses belong to very rich people , but they do n't want to live in them till the summer , so they put in caretakers , and the caretakers have a dog to keep off burglars . I wondered if that was what I had been brought here for . 'Are you going to be a caretaker ? ' I asked the man . 'Shut up , ' he said . So I shut up . After we had been walking a long time , we came to a cottage . A man came out . My man seemed to know him , for he called him Bill . I was quite surprised to see the man was not at all shy with Bill . They seemed very friendly . 'Is that him ? ' said Bill , looking at me . 'Bought him this afternoon , ' said the man . 'Well , ' said Bill , 'he 's ugly enough . He looks fierce . If you want a dog , he 's the sort of dog you want . But what do you want one for ? It seems to me it 's a lot of trouble to take , when there 's no need of any trouble at all . Why not do what I 've always wanted to do ? What 's wrong with just fixing the dog , same as it 's always done , and walking in and helping yourself ? ' ' I 'll tell you what 's wrong , ' said the man . 'To start with , you can't get at the dog to fix him except by day , when they let him out . At night he 's shut up inside the house . And suppose you do fix him during the day what happens then ? Either the bloke gets another before night , or else he sits up all night with a gun . It is n't like as if these blokes was ordinary blokes . They 're down here to look after the house . That 's their job , and they do n't take any chances . ' It was the longest speech I had ever heard the man make , and it seemed to impress Bill . He was quite humble . ' I did n't think of that , ' he said . 'We 'd best start in to train this tyke at once . ' Mother often used to say , when I went on about wanting to go out into the world and see life , 'You 'll be sorry when you do . The world isn't all bones and liver . ' And I had n't been living with the man and Bill in their cottage long before I found out how right she was . It was the man 's shyness that made all the trouble . It seemed as if he hated to be taken notice of . It started on my very first night at the cottage . I had fallen asleep in the kitchen , tired out after all the excitement of the day and the long walks I had had , when something woke me with a start . It was somebody scratching at the window , trying to get in . Well , I ask you , I ask any dog , what would you have done in my place ? Ever since I was old enough to listen , mother had told me over and over again what I must do in a case like this . It is the A B C of a dog's education . 'If you are in a room and you hear anyone trying to get in , ' mother used to say , 'bark . It may be someone who has business there , or it may not . Bark first , and inquire afterwards . Dogs were made to be heard and not seen . ' I lifted my head and yelled . I have a good , deep voice , due to a hound strain in my pedigree , and at the public-house , when there was a full moon , I have often had people leaning out of the windows and saying things all down the street . I took a deep breath and let it go . 'Man ! ' I shouted . 'Bill ! Man ! Come quick ! Here 's a burglar getting in ! ' Then somebody struck a light , and it was the man himself . He had come in through the window . He picked up a stick , and he walloped me . I could n't understand it . I could n't see where I had done the wrong thing . But he was the boss , so there was nothing to be said . If you 'll believe me , that same thing happened every night . Every single night ! And sometimes twice or three times before morning . And every time I would bark my loudest and the man would strike a light and wallop me . The thing was baffling . I could n't possibly have mistaken what mother had said to me . She said it too often for that . Bark ! Bark ! Bark ! It was the main plank of her whole system of education . And yet , here I was , getting walloped every night for doing it . I thought it out till my head ached , and finally I got it right . I began to see that mother 's outlook was narrow . No doubt , living with a man like master at the public-house , a man without a trace of shyness in his composition , barking was all right . But circumstances alter cases . I belonged to a man who was a mass of nerves , who got the jumps if you spoke to him . What I had to do was to forget the training I had had from mother , sound as it no doubt was as a general thing , and to adapt myself to the needs of the particular man who had happened to buy me . I had tried mother 's way , and all it had brought me was walloping , so now I would think for myself . So next night , when I heard the window go , I lay there without a word , though it went against all my better feelings . I did n't even growl . Someone came in and moved about in the dark , with a lantern , but , though I smelt that it was the man , I did n't ask him a single question . And presently the man lit a light and came over to me and gave me a pat , which was a thing he had never done before . 'Good dog ! ' he said . 'Now you can have this . ' And he let me lick out the saucepan in which the dinner had been cooked . After that , we got on fine . Whenever I heard anyone at the window I just kept curled up and took no notice , and every time I got a bone or something good . It was easy , once you had got the hang of things . It was about a week after that the man took me out one morning , and we walked a long way till we turned in at some big gates and went along a very smooth road till we came to a great house , standing all by itself in the middle of a whole lot of country . There was a big lawn in front of it , and all round there were fields and trees , and at the back a great wood . The man rang a bell , and the door opened , and an old man came out . 'Well ? ' he said , not very cordially . ' I thought you might want to buy a good watch-dog , ' said the man . 'Well , that 's queer , your saying that , ' said the caretaker . 'It 's a coincidence . That 's exactly what I do want to buy . I was just thinking of going along and trying to get one . My old dog picked up something this morning that he ought n't to have , and he 's dead , poor feller . ' 'Poor feller , ' said the man . 'Found an old bone with phosphorus on it , I guess . ' 'What do you want for this one ? ' 'Five shillings . ' 'Is he a good watch-dog ? ' 'He 's a grand watch-dog . ' 'He looks fierce enough . ' 'Ah ! ' So the caretaker gave the man his five shillings , and the man went off and left me . At first the newness of everything and the unaccustomed smells and getting to know the caretaker , who was a nice old man , prevented my missing the man , but as the day went on and I began to realize that he had gone and would never come back , I got very depressed . I pattered all over the house , whining . It was a most interesting house , bigger than I thought a house could possibly be , but it could n't cheer me up . You may think it strange that I should pine for the man , after all the wallopings he had given me , and it is odd , when you come to think of it . But dogs are dogs , and they are built like that . By the time it was evening I was thoroughly miserable . I found a shoe and an old clothes-brush in one of the rooms , but could eat nothing . I just sat and moped . It 's a funny thing , but it seems as if it always happened that just when you are feeling most miserable , something nice happens . As I sat there , there came from outside the sound of a motor-bicycle , and somebody shouted . It was dear old Fred , my old pal Fred , the best old boy that ever stepped . I recognized his voice in a second , and I was scratching at the door before the old man had time to get up out of his chair . Well , well , well ! That was a pleasant surprise ! I ran five times round the lawn without stopping , and then I came back and jumped up at him . 'What are you doing down here , Fred ? ' I said . 'Is this caretaker your father ? Have you seen the rabbits in the wood ? How long are you going to stop ? How 's mother ? I like the country . Have you come all the way from the public-house ? I 'm living here now . Your father gave five shillings for me . That 's twice as much as I was worth when I saw you last . ' 'Why , it 's young Nigger ! ' That was what they called me at the saloon . 'What are you doing here ? Where did you get this dog , father ? ' ' A man sold him to me this morning . Poor old Bob got poisoned . This one ought to be just as good a watch-dog . He barks loud enough . ' 'He should be . His mother is the best watch-dog in London . This cheese-hound used to belong to the boss . Funny him getting down here . ' We went into the house and had supper . And after supper we sat and talked . Fred was only down for the night , he said , because the boss wanted him back next day . 'And I 'd sooner have my job , than yours , dad , ' he said . 'Of all the lonely places ! I wonder you are n't scared of burglars . ' ' I 've my shot-gun , and there 's the dog . I might be scared if it wasn't for him , but he kind of gives me confidence . Old Bob was the same . Dogs are a comfort in the country . ' 'Get many tramps here ? ' ' I 've only seen one in two months , and that 's the feller who sold me the dog here . ' As they were talking about the man , I asked Fred if he knew him . They might have met at the public-house , when the man was buying me from the boss . 'You would like him , ' I said . ' I wish you could have met . ' They both looked at me . 'What 's he growling at ? ' asked Fred . 'Think he heard something ? ' The old man laughed . 'He was n't growling . He was talking in his sleep . You 're nervous , Fred . It comes of living in the city . ' 'Well , I am . I like this place in the daytime , but it gives me the pip at night . It 's so quiet . How you can stand it here all the time , I ca n't understand . Two nights of it would have me seeing things . ' His father laughed . 'If you feel like that , Fred , you had better take the gun to bed with you . I shall be quite happy without it . ' ' I will , ' said Fred . ' I 'll take six if you 've got them . ' And after that they went upstairs . I had a basket in the hall , which had belonged to Bob , the dog who had got poisoned . It was a comfortable basket , but I was so excited at having met Fred again that I couldn't sleep . Besides , there was a smell of mice somewhere , and I had to move around , trying to place it . I was just sniffing at a place in the wall , when I heard a scratching noise . At first I thought it was the mice working in a different place , but , when I listened , I found that the sound came from the window . Somebody was doing something to it from outside . If it had been mother , she would have lifted the roof off right there , and so should I , if it had n't been for what the man had taught me . I did n't think it possible that this could be the man come back , for he had gone away and said nothing about ever seeing me again . But I didn't bark . I stopped where I was and listened . And presently the window came open , and somebody began to climb in . I gave a good sniff , and I knew it was the man . I was so delighted that for a moment I nearly forgot myself and shouted with joy , but I remembered in time how shy he was , and stopped myself . But I ran to him and jumped up quite quietly , and he told me to lie down . I was disappointed that he did n't seem more pleased to see me . I lay down . It was very dark , but he had brought a lantern with him , and I could see him moving about the room , picking things up and putting them in a bag which he had brought with him . Every now and then he would stop and listen , and then he would start moving round again . He was very quick about it , but very quiet . It was plain that he did n't want Fred or his father to come down and find him . I kept thinking about this peculiarity of his while I watched him . I suppose , being chummy myself , I find it hard to understand that everybody else in the world is n't chummy too . Of course , my experience at the public-house had taught me that men are just as different from each other as dogs . If I chewed master 's shoe , for instance , he used to kick me ; but if I chewed Fred 's , Fred would tickle me under the ear . And , similarly , some men are shy and some men are mixers . I quite appreciated that , but I could n't help feeling that the man carried shyness to a point where it became morbid . And he did n't give himself a chance to cure himself of it . That was the point . Imagine a man hating to meet people so much that he never visited their houses till the middle of the night , when they were in bed and asleep . It was silly . Shyness has always been something so outside my nature that I suppose I have never really been able to look at it sympathetically . I have always held the view that you can get over it if you make an effort . The trouble with the man was that he would n't make an effort . He went out of his way to avoid meeting people . I was fond of the man . He was the sort of person you never get to know very well , but we had been together for quite a while , and I wouldn't have been a dog if I had n't got attached to him . As I sat and watched him creep about the room , it suddenly came to me that here was a chance of doing him a real good turn in spite of himself . Fred was upstairs , and Fred , as I knew by experience , was the easiest man to get along with in the world . Nobody could be shy with Fred . I felt that if only I could bring him and the man together , they would get along splendidly , and it would teach the man not to be silly and avoid people . It would help to give him the confidence which he needed . I had seen him with Bill , and I knew that he could be perfectly natural and easy when he liked . It was true that the man might object at first , but after a while he would see that I had acted simply for his good , and would be grateful . The difficulty was , how to get Fred down without scaring the man . I knew that if I shouted he would n't wait , but would be out of the window and away before Fred could get there . What I had to do was to go to Fred 's room , explain the whole situation quietly to him , and ask him to come down and make himself pleasant . The man was far too busy to pay any attention to me . He was kneeling in a corner with his back to me , putting something in his bag . I seized the opportunity to steal softly from the room . Fred 's door was shut , and I could hear him snoring . I scratched gently , and then harder , till I heard the snores stop . He got out of bed and opened the door . 'Do n't make a noise , ' I whispered . 'Come on downstairs . I want you to meet a friend of mine . ' At first he was quite peevish . 'What 's the idea , ' he said , 'coming and spoiling a man 's beauty-sleep ? Get out . ' He actually started to go back into the room . 'No , honestly , Fred , ' I said , ' I 'm not fooling you . There is a man downstairs . He got in through the window . I want you to meet him . He's very shy , and I think it will do him good to have a chat with you . ' 'What are you whining about ? ' Fred began , and then he broke off suddenly and listened . We could both hear the man 's footsteps as he moved about . Fred jumped back into the room . He came out , carrying something . He did n't say any more but started to go downstairs , very quiet , and I went after him . There was the man , still putting things in his bag . I was just going to introduce Fred , when Fred , the silly ass , gave a great yell . I could have bitten him . 'What did you want to do that for , you chump ? ' I said ' I told you he was shy . Now you 've scared him . ' He certainly had . The man was out of the window quicker than you would have believed possible . He just flew out . I called after him that it was only Fred and me , but at that moment a gun went off with a tremendous bang , so he could n't have heard me . I was pretty sick about it . The whole thing had gone wrong . Fred seemed to have lost his head entirely . He was behaving like a perfect ass . Naturally the man had been frightened with him carrying on in that way . I jumped out of the window to see if I could find the man and explain , but he was gone . Fred jumped out after me , and nearly squashed me . It was pitch dark out there . I could n't see a thing . But I knew the man could not have gone far , or I should have heard him . I started to sniff round on the chance of picking up his trail . It was n't long before I struck it . Fred 's father had come down now , and they were running about . The old man had a light . I followed the trail , and it ended at a large cedar-tree , not far from the house . I stood underneath it and looked up , but of course I could not see anything . 'Are you up there ? ' I shouted . 'There 's nothing to be scared at . It was only Fred . He 's an old pal of mine . He works at the place where you bought me . His gun went off by accident . He wo n't hurt you . ' There was n't a sound . I began to think I must have made a mistake . 'He 's got away , ' I heard Fred say to his father , and just as he said it I caught a faint sound of someone moving in the branches above me . 'No he has n't ! ' I shouted . 'He 's up this tree . ' ' I believe the dog 's found him , dad ! ' 'Yes , he 's up here . Come along and meet him . ' Fred came to the foot of the tree . 'You up there , ' he said , 'come along down . ' Not a sound from the tree . 'It 's all right , ' I explained , 'he _is_ up there , but he 's very shy . Ask him again . ' 'All right , ' said Fred . 'Stay there if you want to . But I 'm going to shoot off this gun into the branches just for fun . ' And then the man started to come down . As soon as he touched the ground I jumped up at him . 'This is fine ! ' I said 'Here 's my friend Fred . You 'll like him . ' But it was n't any good . They did n't get along together at all . They hardly spoke . The man went into the house , and Fred went after him , carrying his gun . And when they got into the house it was just the same . The man sat in one chair , and Fred sat in another , and after a long time some men came in a motor-car , and the man went away with them . He did n't say good-bye to me . When he had gone , Fred and his father made a great fuss of me . I could n't understand it . Men are so odd . The man was n't a bit pleased that I had brought him and Fred together , but Fred seemed as if he could n't do enough for me for having introduced him to the man . However , Fred 's father produced some cold ham -- my favourite dish -- and gave me quite a lot of it , so I stopped worrying over the thing . As mother used to say , 'Do n't bother your head about what does n't concern you . The only thing a dog need concern himself with is the bill-of-fare . Eat your bun , and do n't make yourself busy about other people 's affairs . ' Mother 's was in some ways a narrow outlook , but she had a great fund of sterling common sense . II . _He Moves in Society_ It was one of those things which are really nobody 's fault . It was not the chauffeur 's fault , and it was not mine . I was having a friendly turn-up with a pal of mine on the side-walk ; he ran across the road ; I ran after him ; and the car came round the corner and hit me . It must have been going pretty slow , or I should have been killed . As it was , I just had the breath knocked out of me . You know how you feel when the butcher catches you just as you are edging out of the shop with a bit of meat . It was like that . I was n't taking much interest in things for awhile , but when I did I found that I was the centre of a group of three -- the chauffeur , a small boy , and the small boy 's nurse . The small boy was very well-dressed , and looked delicate . He was crying . 'Poor doggie , ' he said , 'poor doggie . ' 'It was n't my fault , Master Peter , ' said the chauffeur respectfully . 'He run out into the road before I seen him . ' 'That 's right , ' I put in , for I did n't want to get the man into trouble . 'Oh , he 's not dead , ' said the small boy . 'He barked . ' 'He growled , ' said the nurse . 'Come away , Master Peter . He might bite you . ' Women are trying sometimes . It is almost as if they deliberately misunderstood . ' I wo n't come away . I 'm going to take him home with me and send for the doctor to come and see him . He 's going to be my dog . ' This sounded all right . Goodness knows I am no snob , and can rough it when required , but I do like comfort when it comes my way , and it seemed to me that this was where I got it . And I liked the boy . He was the right sort . The nurse , a very unpleasant woman , had to make objections . 'Master Peter ! You ca n't take him home , a great , rough , fierce , common dog ! What would your mother say ? ' ' I 'm going to take him home , ' repeated the child , with a determination which I heartily admired , 'and he 's going to be my dog . I shall call him Fido . ' There 's always a catch in these good things . Fido is a name I particularly detest . All dogs do . There was a dog called that that I knew once , and he used to get awfully sick when we shouted it out after him in the street . No doubt there have been respectable dogs called Fido , but to my mind it is a name like Aubrey or Clarence . You may be able to live it down , but you start handicapped . However , one must take the rough with the smooth , and I was prepared to yield the point . 'If you wait , Master Peter , your father will buy you a beautiful , lovely dog .... ' ' I do n't want a beautiful , lovely dog . I want this dog . ' The slur did not wound me . I have no illusions about my looks . Mine is an honest , but not a beautiful , face . 'It 's no use talking , ' said the chauffeur , grinning . 'He means to have him . Shove him in , and let 's be getting back , or they 'll be thinking His Nibs has been kidnapped . ' So I was carried to the car . I could have walked , but I had an idea that I had better not . I had made my hit as a crippled dog , and a crippled dog I intended to remain till things got more settled down . The chauffeur started the car off again . What with the shock I had had and the luxury of riding in a motor-car , I was a little distrait , and I could not say how far we went . But it must have been miles and miles , for it seemed a long time afterwards that we stopped at the biggest house I have ever seen . There were smooth lawns and flower-beds , and men in overalls , and fountains and trees , and , away to the right , kennels with about a million dogs in them , all pushing their noses through the bars and shouting . They all wanted to know who I was and what prizes I had won , and then I realized that I was moving in high society . I let the small boy pick me up and carry me into the house , though it was all he could do , poor kid , for I was some weight . He staggered up the steps and along a great hall , and then let me flop on the carpet of the most beautiful room you ever saw . The carpet was a yard thick . There was a woman sitting in a chair , and as soon as she saw me she gave a shriek . ' I told Master Peter you would not be pleased , m'lady , ' said the nurse , who seemed to have taken a positive dislike to me , 'but he would bring the nasty brute home . ' 'He 's not a nasty brute , mother . He 's my dog , and his name 's Fido . John ran over him in the car , and I brought him home to live with us . I love him . ' This seemed to make an impression . Peter 's mother looked as if she were weakening . 'But , Peter , dear , I do n't know what your father will say . He 's so particular about dogs . All his dogs are prize-winners , pedigree dogs . This is such a mongrel . ' ' A nasty , rough , ugly , common dog , m'lady , ' said the nurse , sticking her oar in in an absolutely uncalled-for way . Just then a man came into the room . 'What on earth ? ' he said , catching sight of me . 'It 's a dog Peter has brought home . He says he wants to keep him . ' ' I 'm going to keep him , ' corrected Peter firmly . I do like a child that knows his own mind . I was getting fonder of Peter every minute . I reached up and licked his hand . 'See ! He knows he 's my dog , do n't you , Fido ? He licked me . ' 'But , Peter , he looks so fierce . ' This , unfortunately , is true . I do look fierce . It is rather a misfortune for a perfectly peaceful dog . ' I 'm sure it 's not safe your having him . ' 'He 's my dog , and his name 's Fido . I am going to tell cook to give him a bone . ' His mother looked at his father , who gave rather a nasty laugh . 'My dear Helen , ' he said , 'ever since Peter was born , ten years ago , he has not asked for a single thing , to the best of my recollection , which he has not got . Let us be consistent . I do n't approve of this caricature of a dog , but if Peter wants him , I suppose he must have him . ' 'Very well . But the first sign of viciousness he shows , he shall be shot . He makes me nervous . ' So they left it at that , and I went off with Peter to get my bone . After lunch , he took me to the kennels to introduce me to the other dogs . I had to go , but I knew it would not be pleasant , and it was n't . Any dog will tell you what these prize-ribbon dogs are like . Their heads are so swelled they have to go into their kennels backwards . It was just as I had expected . There were mastiffs , terriers , poodles , spaniels , bulldogs , sheepdogs , and every other kind of dog you can imagine , all prize-winners at a hundred shows , and every single dog in the place just shoved his head back and laughed himself sick . I never felt so small in my life , and I was glad when it was over and Peter took me off to the stables . I was just feeling that I never wanted to see another dog in my life , when a terrier ran out , shouting . As soon as he saw me , he came up inquiringly , walking very stiff-legged , as terriers do when they see a stranger . 'Well , ' I said , 'and what particular sort of a prize-winner are you ? Tell me all about the ribbons they gave you at the Crystal Palace , and let 's get it over . ' He laughed in a way that did me good . 'Guess again ! ' he said . 'Did you take me for one of the nuts in the kennels ? My name 's Jack , and I belong to one of the grooms . ' 'What ! ' I cried . 'You are n't Champion Bowlegs Royal or anything of that sort ! I 'm glad to meet you . ' So we rubbed noses as friendly as you please . It was a treat meeting one of one 's own sort . I had had enough of those high-toned dogs who look at you as if you were something the garbage-man had forgotten to take away . 'So you 've been talking to the swells , have you ? ' said Jack . 'He would take me , ' I said , pointing to Peter . 'Oh , you 're his latest , are you ? Then you 're all right -- while it lasts . ' 'How do you mean , while it lasts ? ' 'Well , I 'll tell you what happened",The Man With Two Left Feet

A PROCESSION ! '' THE LOST WORLD The Lost World CHAPTER I `` There Are Heroisms All Round Us '' Mr. Hungerton , her father , really was the most tactless person upon earth , -- a fluffy , feathery , untidy cockatoo of a man , perfectly good-natured , but absolutely centered upon his own silly self . If anything could have driven me from Gladys , it would have been the thought of such a father-in-law . I am convinced that he really believed in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a week for the pleasure of his company , and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism , a subject upon which he was by way of being an authority . For an hour or more that evening I listened to his monotonous chirrup about bad money driving out good , the token value of silver , the depreciation of the rupee , and the true standards of exchange . `` Suppose , '' he cried with feeble violence , `` that all the debts in the world were called up simultaneously , and immediate payment insisted upon , -- what under our present conditions would happen then ? '' I gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man , upon which he jumped from his chair , reproved me for my habitual levity , which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence , and bounced off out of the room to dress for a Masonic meeting . At last I was alone with Gladys , and the moment of Fate had come ! All that evening I had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope ; hope of victory and fear of repulse alternating in his mind . She sat with that proud , delicate profile of hers outlined against the red curtain . How beautiful she was ! And yet how aloof ! We had been friends , quite good friends ; but never could I get beyond the same comradeship which I might have established with one of my fellow-reporters upon the Gazette , -- perfectly frank , perfectly kindly , and perfectly unsexual . My instincts are all against a woman being too frank and at her ease with me . It is no compliment to a man . Where the real sex feeling begins , timidity and distrust are its companions , heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in hand . The bent head , the averted eye , the faltering voice , the wincing figure -- these , and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply , are the true signals of passion . Even in my short life I had learned as much as that -- or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct . Gladys was full of every womanly quality . Some judged her to be cold and hard ; but such a thought was treason . That delicately bronzed skin , almost oriental in its coloring , that raven hair , the large liquid eyes , the full but exquisite lips , -- all the stigmata of passion were there . But I was sadly conscious that up to now I had never found the secret of drawing it forth . However , come what might , I should have done with suspense and bring matters to a head to-night . She could but refuse me , and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted brother . So far my thoughts had carried me , and I was about to break the long and uneasy silence , when two critical , dark eyes looked round at me , and the proud head was shaken in smiling reproof . `` I have a presentiment that you are going to propose , Ned . I do wish you would n't ; for things are so much nicer as they are . '' I drew my chair a little nearer . `` Now , how did you know that I was going to propose ? '' I asked in genuine wonder . `` Do n't women always know ? Do you suppose any woman in the world was ever taken unawares ? But -- oh , Ned , our friendship has been so good and so pleasant ! What a pity to spoil it ! Do n't you feel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked ? '' `` I do n't know , Gladys . You see , I can talk face to face with -- with the station-master . '' I ca n't imagine how that official came into the matter ; but in he trotted , and set us both laughing . `` That does not satisfy me in the least . I want my arms round you , and your head on my breast , and -- oh , Gladys , I want -- -- '' She had sprung from her chair , as she saw signs that I proposed to demonstrate some of my wants . `` You 've spoiled everything , Ned , '' she said . `` It 's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in ! It is such a pity ! Why ca n't you control yourself ? '' `` I did n't invent it , '' I pleaded . `` It 's nature . It 's love . '' `` Well , perhaps if both love , it may be different . I have never felt it . '' `` But you must -- you , with your beauty , with your soul ! Oh , Gladys , you were made for love ! You must love ! '' `` One must wait till it comes . '' `` But why ca n't you love me , Gladys ? Is it my appearance , or what ? '' She did unbend a little . She put forward a hand -- such a gracious , stooping attitude it was -- and she pressed back my head . Then she looked into my upturned face with a very wistful smile . `` No it is n't that , '' she said at last . `` You 're not a conceited boy by nature , and so I can safely tell you it is not that . It 's deeper . '' `` My character ? '' She nodded severely . `` What can I do to mend it ? Do sit down and talk it over . No , really , I wo n't if you 'll only sit down ! '' She looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my mind than her whole-hearted confidence . How primitive and bestial it looks when you put it down in black and white ! -- and perhaps after all it is only a feeling peculiar to myself . Anyhow , she sat down . `` Now tell me what 's amiss with me ? '' `` I 'm in love with somebody else , '' said she . It was my turn to jump out of my chair . `` It 's nobody in particular , '' she explained , laughing at the expression of my face : `` only an ideal . I 've never met the kind of man I mean . '' `` Tell me about him . What does he look like ? '' `` Oh , he might look very much like you . '' `` How dear of you to say that ! Well , what is it that he does that I do n't do ? Just say the word , -- teetotal , vegetarian , aeronaut , theosophist , superman . I 'll have a try at it , Gladys , if you will only give me an idea what would please you . '' She laughed at the elasticity of my character . `` Well , in the first place , I do n't think my ideal would speak like that , '' said she . `` He would be a harder , sterner man , not so ready to adapt himself to a silly girl 's whim . But , above all , he must be a man who could do , who could act , who could look Death in the face and have no fear of him , a man of great deeds and strange experiences . It is never a man that I should love , but always the glories he had won ; for they would be reflected upon me . Think of Richard Burton ! When I read his wife's life of him I could so understand her love ! And Lady Stanley ! Did you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband ? These are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul , and yet be the greater , not the less , on account of her love , honored by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds . '' She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down the whole level of the interview . I gripped myself hard , and went on with the argument . `` We ca n't all be Stanleys and Burtons , '' said I ; `` besides , we do n't get the chance , -- at least , I never had the chance . If I did , I should try to take it . '' `` But chances are all around you . It is the mark of the kind of man I mean that he makes his own chances . You ca n't hold him back . I've never met him , and yet I seem to know him so well . There are heroisms all round us waiting to be done . It 's for men to do them , and for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men . Look at that young Frenchman who went up last week in a balloon . It was blowing a gale of wind ; but because he was announced to go he insisted on starting . The wind blew him fifteen hundred miles in twenty-four hours , and he fell in the middle of Russia . That was the kind of man I mean . Think of the woman he loved , and how other women must have envied her ! That 's what I should like to be , -- envied for my man . '' `` I 'd have done it to please you . '' `` But you should n't do it merely to please me . You should do it because you ca n't help yourself , because it 's natural to you , because the man in you is crying out for heroic expression . Now , when you described the Wigan coal explosion last month , could you not have gone down and helped those people , in spite of the choke-damp ? '' `` I did . '' `` You never said so . '' `` There was nothing worth bucking about . '' `` I did n't know . '' She looked at me with rather more interest . `` That was brave of you . '' `` I had to . If you want to write good copy , you must be where the things are . '' `` What a prosaic motive ! It seems to take all the romance out of it . But , still , whatever your motive , I am glad that you went down that mine . '' She gave me her hand ; but with such sweetness and dignity that I could only stoop and kiss it . `` I dare say I am merely a foolish woman with a young girl 's fancies . And yet it is so real with me , so entirely part of my very self , that I can not help acting upon it . If I marry , I do want to marry a famous man ! '' `` Why should you not ? '' I cried . `` It is women like you who brace men up . Give me a chance , and see if I will take it ! Besides , as you say , men ought to MAKE their own chances , and not wait until they are given . Look at Clive -- just a clerk , and he conquered India ! By George ! I'll do something in the world yet ! '' She laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence . `` Why not ? '' she said . `` You have everything a man could have , -- youth , health , strength , education , energy . I was sorry you spoke . And now I am glad -- so glad -- if it wakens these thoughts in you ! '' `` And if I do -- -- '' Her dear hand rested like warm velvet upon my lips . `` Not another word , Sir ! You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour ago ; only I had n't the heart to remind you . Some day , perhaps , when you have won your place in the world , we shall talk it over again . '' And so it was that I found myself that foggy November evening pursuing the Camberwell tram with my heart glowing within me , and with the eager determination that not another day should elapse before I should find some deed which was worthy of my lady . But who -- who in all this wide world could ever have imagined the incredible shape which that deed was to take , or the strange steps by which I was led to the doing of it ? And , after all , this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative ; and yet there would have been no narrative without it , for it is only when a man goes out into the world with the thought that there are heroisms all round him , and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of him , that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows , and ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventures and the great rewards . Behold me , then , at the office of the Daily Gazette , on the staff of which I was a most insignificant unit , with the settled determination that very night , if possible , to find the quest which should be worthy of my Gladys ! Was it hardness , was it selfishness , that she should ask me to risk my life for her own glorification ? Such thoughts may come to middle age ; but never to ardent three-and-twenty in the fever of his first love . CHAPTER II `` Try Your Luck with Professor Challenger '' I always liked McArdle , the crabbed , old , round-backed , red-headed news editor , and I rather hoped that he liked me . Of course , Beaumont was the real boss ; but he lived in the rarefied atmosphere of some Olympian height from which he could distinguish nothing smaller than an international crisis or a split in the Cabinet . Sometimes we saw him passing in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum , with his eyes staring vaguely and his mind hovering over the Balkans or the Persian Gulf . He was above and beyond us . But McArdle was his first lieutenant , and it was he that we knew . The old man nodded as I entered the room , and he pushed his spectacles far up on his bald forehead . `` Well , Mr. Malone , from all I hear , you seem to be doing very well , '' said he in his kindly Scotch accent . I thanked him . `` The colliery explosion was excellent . So was the Southwark fire . You have the true descreeptive touch . What did you want to see me about ? '' `` To ask a favor . '' He looked alarmed , and his eyes shunned mine . `` Tut , tut ! What is it ? '' `` Do you think , Sir , that you could possibly send me on some mission for the paper ? I would do my best to put it through and get you some good copy . '' `` What sort of meesion had you in your mind , Mr . Malone ? '' `` Well , Sir , anything that had adventure and danger in it . I really would do my very best . The more difficult it was , the better it would suit me . '' `` You seem very anxious to lose your life . '' `` To justify my life , Sir . '' `` Dear me , Mr. Malone , this is very -- very exalted . I 'm afraid the day for this sort of thing is rather past . The expense of the 'special meesion ' business hardly justifies the result , and , of course , in any case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command public confidence who would get such an order . The big blank spaces in the map are all being filled in , and there 's no room for romance anywhere . Wait a bit , though ! '' he added , with a sudden smile upon his face . `` Talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea . What about exposing a fraud -- a modern Munchausen -- and making him rideeculous ? You could show him up as the liar that he is ! Eh , man , it would be fine . How does it appeal to you ? '' `` Anything -- anywhere -- I care nothing . '' McArdle was plunged in thought for some minutes . `` I wonder whether you could get on friendly -- or at least on talking terms with the fellow , '' he said , at last . `` You seem to have a sort of genius for establishing relations with people -- seempathy , I suppose , or animal magnetism , or youthful vitality , or something . I am conscious of it myself . '' `` You are very good , sir . '' `` So why should you not try your luck with Professor Challenger , of Enmore Park ? '' I dare say I looked a little startled . `` Challenger ! '' I cried . `` Professor Challenger , the famous zoologist ! Was n't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell , of the Telegraph ? '' The news editor smiled grimly . `` Do you mind ? Did n't you say it was adventures you were after ? '' `` It is all in the way of business , sir , '' I answered . `` Exactly . I do n't suppose he can always be so violent as that . I'm thinking that Blundell got him at the wrong moment , maybe , or in the wrong fashion . You may have better luck , or more tact in handling him . There 's something in your line there , I am sure , and the Gazette should work it . '' `` I really know nothing about him , '' said I . `` I only remember his name in connection with the police-court proceedings , for striking Blundell . '' `` I have a few notes for your guidance , Mr. Malone . I 've had my eye on the Professor for some little time . '' He took a paper from a drawer . `` Here is a summary of his record . I give it you briefly : -- '' 'Challenger , George Edward . Born : Largs , N. B. , 1863 . Educ . : Largs Academy ; Edinburgh University . British Museum Assistant , 1892 . Assistant-Keeper of Comparative Anthropology Department , 1893 . Resigned after acrimonious correspondence same year . Winner of Crayston Medal for Zoological Research . Foreign Member of ' -- well , quite a lot of things , about two inches of small type -- 'Societe Belge , American Academy of Sciences , La Plata , etc. , etc . Ex-President Palaeontological Society . Section H , British Association ' -- so on , so on ! -- 'Publications : `` Some Observations Upon a Series of Kalmuck Skulls '' ; `` Outlines of Vertebrate Evolution '' ; and numerous papers , including `` The underlying fallacy of Weissmannism , '' which caused heated discussion at the Zoological Congress of Vienna . Recreations : Walking , Alpine climbing . Address : Enmore Park , Kensington , W.' '' There , take it with you . I 've nothing more for you to-night . '' I pocketed the slip of paper . `` One moment , sir , '' I said , as I realized that it was a pink bald head , and not a red face , which was fronting me . `` I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman . What has he done ? '' The face flashed back again . `` Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago . Came back last year . Had undoubtedly been to South America , but refused to say exactly where . Began to tell his adventures in a vague way , but somebody started to pick holes , and he just shut up like an oyster . Something wonderful happened -- or the man 's a champion liar , which is the more probable supposeetion . Had some damaged photographs , said to be fakes . Got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions , and heaves reporters down the stairs . In my opinion he 's just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science . That 's your man , Mr. Malone . Now , off you run , and see what you can make of him . You're big enough to look after yourself . Anyway , you are all safe . Employers ' Liability Act , you know . '' A grinning red face turned once more into a pink oval , fringed with gingery fluff ; the interview was at an end . I walked across to the Savage Club , but instead of turning into it I leaned upon the railings of Adelphi Terrace and gazed thoughtfully for a long time at the brown , oily river . I can always think most sanely and clearly in the open air . I took out the list of Professor Challenger 's exploits , and I read it over under the electric lamp . Then I had what I can only regard as an inspiration . As a Pressman , I felt sure from what I had been told that I could never hope to get into touch with this cantankerous Professor . But these recriminations , twice mentioned in his skeleton biography , could only mean that he was a fanatic in science . Was there not an exposed margin there upon which he might be accessible ? I would try . I entered the club . It was just after eleven , and the big room was fairly full , though the rush had not yet set in . I noticed a tall , thin , angular man seated in an arm-chair by the fire . He turned as I drew my chair up to him . It was the man of all others whom I should have chosen -- Tarp Henry , of the staff of Nature , a thin , dry , leathery creature , who was full , to those who knew him , of kindly humanity . I plunged instantly into my subject . `` What do you know of Professor Challenger ? '' `` Challenger ? '' He gathered his brows in scientific disapproval . `` Challenger was the man who came with some cock-and-bull story from South America . '' `` What story ? '' `` Oh , it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered . I believe he has retracted since . Anyhow , he has suppressed it all . He gave an interview to Reuter 's , and there was such a howl that he saw it would n't do . It was a discreditable business . There were one or two folk who were inclined to take him seriously , but he soon choked them off . '' `` How ? '' `` Well , by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior . There was poor old Wadley , of the Zoological Institute . Wadley sent a message : 'The President of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to Professor Challenger , and would take it as a personal favor if he would do them the honor to come to their next meeting . ' The answer was unprintable . '' `` You do n't say ? '' `` Well , a bowdlerized version of it would run : 'Professor Challenger presents his compliments to the President of the Zoological Institute , and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil . ' '' `` Good Lord ! '' `` Yes , I expect that 's what old Wadley said . I remember his wail at the meeting , which began : 'In fifty years experience of scientific intercourse -- -- ' It quite broke the old man up . '' `` Anything more about Challenger ? '' `` Well , I 'm a bacteriologist , you know . I live in a nine-hundred-diameter microscope . I can hardly claim to take serious notice of anything that I can see with my naked eye . I 'm a frontiersman from the extreme edge of the Knowable , and I feel quite out of place when I leave my study and come into touch with all you great , rough , hulking creatures . I 'm too detached to talk scandal , and yet at scientific conversaziones I HAVE heard something of Challenger , for he is one of those men whom nobody can ignore . He 's as clever as they make 'em -- a full-charged battery of force and vitality , but a quarrelsome , ill-conditioned faddist , and unscrupulous at that . He had gone the length of faking some photographs over the South American business . '' `` You say he is a faddist . What is his particular fad ? '' `` He has a thousand , but the latest is something about Weissmann and Evolution . He had a fearful row about it in Vienna , I believe . '' `` Ca n't you tell me the point ? '' `` Not at the moment , but a translation of the proceedings exists . We have it filed at the office . Would you care to come ? '' `` It 's just what I want . I have to interview the fellow , and I need some lead up to him . It 's really awfully good of you to give me a lift . I 'll go with you now , if it is not too late . '' Half an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a huge tome in front of me , which had been opened at the article `` Weissmann versus Darwin , '' with the sub heading , `` Spirited Protest at Vienna . Lively Proceedings . '' My scientific education having been somewhat neglected , I was unable to follow the whole argument , but it was evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very aggressive fashion , and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues . `` Protests , '' `` Uproar , '' and `` General appeal to the Chairman '' were three of the first brackets which caught my eye . Most of the matter might have been written in Chinese for any definite meaning that it conveyed to my brain . `` I wish you could translate it into English for me , '' I said , pathetically , to my help-mate . `` Well , it is a translation . '' `` Then I 'd better try my luck with the original . '' `` It is certainly rather deep for a layman . '' `` If I could only get a single good , meaty sentence which seemed to convey some sort of definite human idea , it would serve my turn . Ah , yes , this one will do . I seem in a vague way almost to understand it . I 'll copy it out . This shall be my link with the terrible Professor . '' `` Nothing else I can do ? '' `` Well , yes ; I propose to write to him . If I could frame the letter here , and use your address it would give atmosphere . '' `` We 'll have the fellow round here making a row and breaking the furniture . '' `` No , no ; you 'll see the letter -- nothing contentious , I assure you . '' `` Well , that 's my chair and desk . You 'll find paper there . I 'd like to censor it before it goes . '' It took some doing , but I flatter myself that it was n't such a bad job when it was finished . I read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist with some pride in my handiwork . `` DEAR PROFESSOR CHALLENGER , '' it said , `` As a humble student of Nature , I have always taken the most profound interest in your speculations as to the differences between Darwin and Weissmann . I have recently had occasion to refresh my memory by re-reading -- -- '' '' You infernal liar ! '' murmured Tarp Henry . -- '' by re-reading your masterly address at Vienna . That lucid and admirable statement seems to be the last word in the matter . There is one sentence in it , however -- namely : ' I protest strongly against the insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate id is a microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly through the series of generations . ' Have you no desire , in view of later research , to modify this statement ? Do you not think that it is over-accentuated ? With your permission , I would ask the favor of an interview , as I feel strongly upon the subject , and have certain suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation . With your consent , I trust to have the honor of calling at eleven o'clock the day after to-morrow ( Wednesday ) morning . `` I remain , Sir , with assurances of profound respect , yours very truly , EDWARD D . MALONE . '' `` How 's that ? '' I asked , triumphantly . `` Well if your conscience can stand it -- -- '' '' It has never failed me yet . '' `` But what do you mean to do ? '' `` To get there . Once I am in his room I may see some opening . I may even go the length of open confession . If he is a sportsman he will be tickled . '' `` Tickled , indeed ! He 's much more likely to do the tickling . Chain mail , or an American football suit -- that 's what you 'll want . Well , good-bye . I 'll have the answer for you here on Wednesday morning -- if he ever deigns to answer you . He is a violent , dangerous , cantankerous character , hated by everyone who comes across him , and the butt of the students , so far as they dare take a liberty with him . Perhaps it would be best for you if you never heard from the fellow at all . '' CHAPTER III `` He is a Perfectly Impossible Person '' My friend 's fear or hope was not destined to be realized . When I called on Wednesday there was a letter with the West Kensington postmark upon it , and my name scrawled across the envelope in a handwriting which looked like a barbed-wire railing . The contents were as follows : -- `` ENMORE PARK , W. '' SIR , -- I have duly received your note , in which you claim to endorse my views , although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else . You have ventured to use the word 'speculation ' with regard to my statement upon the subject of Darwinism , and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree . The context convinces me , however , that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice , so I am content to pass the matter by . You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture , and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it . I should have thought that only a sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point , but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named , though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me . As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion , I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views . You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man , Austin , when you call , as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves 'journalists . ' `` Yours faithfully , `` GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER . '' This was the letter that I read aloud to Tarp Henry , who had come down early to hear the result of my venture . His only remark was , `` There's some new stuff , cuticura or something , which is better than arnica . '' Some people have such extraordinary notions of humor . It was nearly half-past ten before I had received my message , but a taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment . It was an imposing porticoed house at which we stopped , and the heavily-curtained windows gave every indication of wealth upon the part of this formidable Professor . The door was opened by an odd , swarthy , dried-up person of uncertain age , with a dark pilot jacket and brown leather gaiters . I found afterwards that he was the chauffeur , who filled the gaps left by a succession of fugitive butlers . He looked me up and down with a searching light blue eye . `` Expected ? '' he asked . `` An appointment . '' `` Got your letter ? '' I produced the envelope . `` Right ! '' He seemed to be a person of few words . Following him down the passage I was suddenly interrupted by a small woman , who stepped out from what proved to be the dining-room door . She was a bright , vivacious , dark-eyed lady , more French than English in her type . `` One moment , '' she said . `` You can wait , Austin . Step in here , sir . May I ask if you have met my husband before ? '' `` No , madam , I have not had the honor . '' `` Then I apologize to you in advance . I must tell you that he is a perfectly impossible person -- absolutely impossible . If you are forewarned you will be the more ready to make allowances . '' `` It is most considerate of you , madam . '' `` Get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent . Don't wait to argue with him . Several people have been injured through doing that . Afterwards there is a public scandal and it reflects upon me and all of us . I suppose it was n't about South America you wanted to see him ? '' I could not lie to a lady . `` Dear me ! That is his most dangerous subject . You wo n't believe a word he says -- I 'm sure I do n't wonder . But do n't tell him so , for it makes him very violent . Pretend to believe him , and you may get through all right . Remember he believes it himself . Of that you may be assured . A more honest man never lived . Do n't wait any longer or he may suspect . If you find him dangerous -- really dangerous -- ring the bell and hold him off until I come . Even at his worst I can usually control him . '' With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn Austin , who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our short interview , and I was conducted to the end of the passage . There was a tap at a door , a bull 's bellow from within , and I was face to face with the Professor . He sat in a rotating chair behind a broad table , which was covered with books , maps , and diagrams . As I entered , his seat spun round to face me . His appearance made me gasp . I was prepared for something strange , but not for so overpowering a personality as this . It was his size which took one 's breath away -- his size and his imposing presence . His head was enormous , the largest I have ever seen upon a human being . I am sure that his top-hat , had I ever ventured to don it , would have slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders . He had the face and beard which I associate with an Assyrian bull ; the former florid , the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue , spade-shaped and rippling down over his chest . The hair was peculiar , plastered down in front in a long , curving wisp over his massive forehead . The eyes were blue-gray under great black tufts , very clear , very critical , and very masterful . A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table , save for two enormous hands covered with long black hair . This and a bellowing , roaring , rumbling voice made up my first impression of the notorious Professor Challenger . `` Well ? '' said he , with a most insolent stare . `` What now ? '' I must keep up my deception for at least a little time longer , otherwise here was evidently an end of the interview . `` You were good enough to give me an appointment , sir , '' said I , humbly , producing his envelope . He took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him . `` Oh , you are the young person who can not understand plain English , are you ? My general conclusions you are good enough to approve , as I understand ? '' `` Entirely , sir -- entirely ! '' I was very emphatic . `` Dear me ! That strengthens my position very much , does it not ? Your age and appearance make your support doubly valuable . Well , at least you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna , whose gregarious grunt is , however , not more offensive than the isolated effort of the British hog . '' He glared at me as the present representative of the beast . `` They seem to have behaved abominably , '' said I . `` I assure you that I can fight my own battles , and that I have no possible need of your sympathy . Put me alone , sir , and with my back to the wall . G. E. C. is happiest then . Well , sir , let us do what we can to curtail this visit , which can hardly be agreeable to you , and is inexpressibly irksome to me . You had , as I have been led to believe , some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my thesis . '' There was a brutal directness about his methods which made evasion difficult . I must still make play and wait for a better opening . It had seemed simple enough at a distance . Oh , my Irish wits , could they not help me now , when I needed help so sorely ? He transfixed me with two sharp , steely eyes . `` Come , come ! '' he rumbled . `` I am , of course , a mere student , '' said I , with a fatuous smile , '' hardly more , I might say , than an earnest inquirer . At the same time , it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon Weissmann in this matter . Has not the general evidence since that date tended to -- well , to strengthen his position ? '' `` What evidence ? '' He spoke with a menacing calm . `` Well , of course , I am aware that there is not any what you might call DEFINITE evidence . I alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and the general scientific point of view , if I might so express it . '' He leaned forward with great earnestness . `` I suppose you are aware , '' said he , checking off points upon his fingers , `` that the cranial index is a constant factor ? '' `` Naturally , '' said I . `` And that telegony is still sub judice ? '' `` Undoubtedly . '' `` And that the germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg ? '' `` Why , surely ! '' I cried , and gloried in my own audacity . `` But what does that prove ? '' he asked , in a gentle , persuasive voice . `` Ah , what indeed ? '' I murmured . `` What does it prove ? '' `` Shall I tell you ? '' he cooed . `` Pray do . '' `` It proves , '' he roared , with a sudden blast of fury , `` that you are the damnedest imposter in London -- a vile , crawling journalist , who has no more science than he has decency in his composition ! '' He had sprung to his feet with a mad rage in his eyes . Even at that moment of tension I found time for amazement at the discovery that he was quite a short man , his head not higher than my shoulder -- a stunted Hercules whose tremendous vitality had all run to depth , breadth , and brain . `` Gibberish ! '' he cried , leaning forward , with his fingers on the table and his face projecting . `` That 's what I have been talking to you , sir -- scientific gibberish ! Did you think you could match cunning with me -- you with your walnut of a brain ? You think you are omnipotent , you infernal scribblers , do n't you ? That your praise can make a man and your blame can break him ? We must all bow to you , and try to get a favorable word , must we ? This man shall have a leg up , and this man shall have a dressing down ! Creeping vermin , I know you ! You 've got out of your station . Time was when your ears were clipped . You've lost your sense of proportion . Swollen gas-bags ! I 'll keep you in your proper place . Yes , sir , you have n't got over G. E. C. There's one man who is still your master . He warned you off , but if you WILL come , by the Lord you do it at your own risk . Forfeit , my good Mr. Malone , I claim forfeit ! You have played a rather dangerous game , and it strikes me that you have lost it . '' `` Look here , sir , '' said I , backing to the door and opening it ; `` you can be as abusive as you like . But there is a limit . You shall not assault me . '' `` Shall I not ? '' He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way , but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a rather boyish short jacket which he wore . `` I have thrown several of you out of the house . You will be the fourth or fifth . Three pound fifteen each -- that is how it averaged . Expensive , but very necessary . Now , sir , why should you not follow your brethren ? I rather think you must . '' He resumed his unpleasant and stealthy advance , pointing his toes as he walked , like a dancing master . I could have bolted for the hall door , but it would have been too ignominious . Besides , a little glow of righteous anger was springing up within me . I had been hopelessly in the wrong before , but this man 's menaces were putting me in the right . `` I 'll trouble you to keep your hands off , sir . I 'll not stand it . '' `` Dear me ! '' His black moustache lifted and a white fang twinkled in a sneer . `` You wo n't stand it , eh ? '' `` Do n't be such a fool , Professor ! '' I cried . `` What can you hope for ? I 'm fifteen stone , as hard as nails , and play center three-quarter every Saturday for the London Irish . I 'm not the man -- -- '' It was at that moment that he rushed me . It was lucky that I had opened the door , or we should have gone through it . We did a Catharine-wheel together down the passage . Somehow we gathered up a chair upon our way , and bounded on with it towards the street . My mouth was full of his beard , our arms were locked , our bodies intertwined , and that infernal chair radiated its legs all round us . The watchful Austin had thrown open the hall door . We went with a back somersault down the front steps . I have seen the two Macs attempt something of the kind at the halls , but it appears to take some practise to do it without hurting oneself . The chair went to matchwood at the bottom , and we rolled apart into the gutter . He sprang to his feet , waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic . `` Had enough ? '' he panted . `` You infernal bully ! '' I cried , as I gathered myself together . Then and there we should have tried the thing out , for he was effervescing with fight , but fortunately I was rescued from an odious situation . A policeman was beside us , his notebook in his hand . `` What 's all this ? You ought to be ashamed '' said the policeman . It was the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park . `` Well , '' he insisted , turning to me , `` what is it , then ? '' `` This man attacked me , '' said I . `` Did you attack him ? '' asked the policeman . The Professor breathed hard and said nothing . `` It 's not the first time , either , '' said the policeman , severely , shaking his head . `` You were in trouble last month for the same thing . You 've blackened this young man 's eye . Do you give him in charge , sir ? '' I relented . `` No , '' said I , `` I do not . '' `` What 's that ? '' said the policeman . `` I was to blame myself . I intruded upon him . He gave me fair warning . '' The policeman snapped up his notebook . `` Do n't let us have any more such goings-on , '' said he . `` Now , then ! Move on , there , move on ! '' This to a butcher 's boy , a maid , and one or two loafers who had collected . He clumped heavily down the street , driving this little flock before him . The Professor looked at me , and there was something humorous at the back of his eyes . `` Come in ! '' said he . `` I 've not done with you yet . '' The speech had a sinister sound , but I followed him none the less into the house . The man-servant , Austin , like a wooden image , closed the door behind us . CHAPTER IV `` It 's Just the very Biggest Thing in the World '' Hardly was it shut when Mrs . Challenger darted out from the dining-room . The small woman was in a furious temper . She barred her husband 's way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog . It was evident that she had seen my exit , but had not observed my return . `` You brute , George ! '' she screamed . `` You 've hurt that nice young man . '' He jerked backwards with his thumb . `` Here he is , safe and sound behind me . '' She was confused , but not unduly so . `` I am so sorry , I did n't see you . '' `` I assure you , madam , that it is all right . '' `` He has marked your poor face ! Oh , George , what a brute you are ! Nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other . Everyone hating and making fun of you . You 've finished my patience . This ends it . '' `` Dirty linen , '' he rumbled . `` It 's not a secret , '' she cried . `` Do you suppose that the whole street -- the whole of London , for that matter -- -- Get away , Austin , we do n't want you here . Do you suppose they do n't all talk about you ? Where is your dignity ? You , a man who should have been Regius Professor at a great University with a thousand students all revering you . Where is your dignity , George ? '' `` How about yours , my dear ? '' `` You try me too much . A ruffian -- a common brawling ruffian -- that's what you have become . '' `` Be good , Jessie . '' `` A roaring , raging bully ! '' `` That 's done it ! Stool of penance ! '' said he . To my amazement he stooped , picked her up , and placed her sitting upon a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall . It was at least seven feet high , and so thin that she could hardly balance upon it . A more absurd object than she presented cocked up there with her face convulsed with anger , her feet dangling , and her body rigid for fear of an upset , I could not imagine . `` Let me down ! '' she wailed . `` Say 'please . ' '' `` You brute , George ! Let me down this instant ! '' `` Come into the study , Mr . Malone . '' `` Really , sir -- -- ! '' said I , looking at the lady . `` Here 's Mr. Malone pleading for you , Jessie . Say 'please , ' and down you come . '' `` Oh , you brute ! Please ! please ! '' He took her down as if she had been a canary . `` You must behave yourself , dear . Mr. Malone is a Pressman . He will have it all in his rag to-morrow , and sell an extra dozen among our neighbors . 'Strange story of high life ' -- you felt fairly high on that pedestal , did you not ? Then a sub-title , 'Glimpse of a singular menage . ' He 's a foul feeder , is Mr. Malone , a carrion eater , like all of his kind -- porcus ex grege diaboli -- a swine from the devil 's herd . That 's it , Malone -- what ? '' `` You are really intolerable ! '' said I , hotly . He bellowed with laughter . `` We shall have a coalition presently , '' he boomed , looking from his wife to me and puffing out his enormous chest . Then , suddenly altering his tone , `` Excuse this frivolous family badinage , Mr. Malone . I called you back for some more serious purpose than to mix you up with our little domestic pleasantries . Run away , little woman , and do n't fret . '' He placed a huge hand upon each of her shoulders . `` All that you say is perfectly true . I should be a better man if I did what you advise , but I should n't be quite George Edward Challenger . There are plenty of better men , my dear , but only one G. E. C. So make the best of him . '' He suddenly gave her a resounding kiss , which embarrassed me even more than his violence had done . `` Now , Mr. Malone , '' he continued , with a great accession of dignity , `` this way , if YOU please . '' We re-entered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes before . The Professor closed the door carefully behind us , motioned me into an arm-chair , and pushed a cigar-box under my nose . `` Real San Juan Colorado , '' he said . `` Excitable people like you are the better for narcotics . Heavens ! do n't bite it ! Cut -- and cut with reverence ! Now lean back , and listen attentively to whatever I may care to say to you . If any remark should occur to you , you can reserve it for some more opportune time . `` First of all , as to your return to my house after your most justifiable expulsion '' -- he protruded his beard , and stared at me as one who challenges and invites contradiction -- '' after , as I say , your well-merited expulsion . The reason lay in your answer to that most officious policeman , in which I seemed to discern some glimmering of good feeling upon your part -- more , at any rate , than I am accustomed to associate with your profession . In admitting that the fault of the incident lay with you , you gave some evidence of a certain mental detachment and breadth of view which attracted my favorable notice . The sub-species of the human race to which you unfortunately belong has always been below my mental horizon . Your words brought you suddenly above it . You swam up into my serious notice . For this reason I asked you to return with me , as I was minded to make your further acquaintance . You will kindly deposit your ash in the small Japanese tray on the bamboo table which stands at your left elbow . '' All this he boomed forth like a professor addressing his class . He had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me , and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog , his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids . Now he suddenly turned himself sideways , and all I could see of him was tangled hair with a red , protruding ear . He was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk . He faced me presently with what looked like a very tattered sketch-book in his hand . `` I am going to talk to you about South America , '' said he . `` No comments if you please . First of all , I wish you to understand that nothing I tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my express permission . That permission will , in all human probability , never be given . Is that clear ? '' `` It is very hard , '' said I . `` Surely a judicious account -- -- '' He replaced the notebook upon the table . `` That ends it , '' said he . `` I wish you a very good morning . '' `` No , no ! '' I cried . `` I submit to any conditions . So far as I can see , I have no choice . '' `` None in the world , '' said he . `` Well , then , I promise . '' `` Word of honor ? '' `` Word of honor . '' He looked at me with doubt in his insolent eyes . `` After all , what do I know about your honor ? '' said he . `` Upon my word , sir , '' I cried , angrily , `` you take very great liberties ! I have never been so insulted in my life . '' He seemed more interested than annoyed at my outbreak . `` Round-headed , '' he muttered . `` Brachycephalic , gray-eyed , black-haired , with suggestion of the negroid . Celtic , I presume ? '' `` I am an Irishman , sir . '' `` Irish Irish ? '' `` Yes , sir . '' `` That , of course , explains it . Let me see ; you have given me your promise that my confidence will be respected ? That confidence , I may say , will be far from complete . But I am prepared to give you a few indications which will be of interest . In the first place , you are probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South America -- one which will be classical in the scientific history of the world ? The object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of Wallace and of Bates , which could only be done by observing their reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves noted them . If my expedition had no other results it would still have been noteworthy , but a curious incident occurred to me while there which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry . `` You are aware -- or probably , in this half-educated age , you are not aware -- that the country round some parts of the Amazon is still only partially explored , and that a great number of tributaries , some of them entirely uncharted , run into the main river . It was my business to visit this little-known back-country and to examine its fauna , which furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and monumental work upon zoology which will be my life 's justification . I was returning , my work accomplished , when I had occasion to spend a night at a small Indian village at a point where a certain tributary -- the name and position of which I withhold -- opens into the main river . The natives were Cucama Indians , an amiable but degraded race , with mental powers hardly superior to the average Londoner . I had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river , and had impressed them considerably with my personality , so that I was not surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return . I gathered from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services , and I followed the chief to one of his huts . When I entered I found that the sufferer to whose aid I had been summoned had that instant expired . He was , to my surprise , no Indian , but a white man ; indeed , I may say a very white man , for he was flaxen-haired and had some characteristics of an albino . He was clad in rags , was very emaciated , and bore every trace of prolonged hardship . So far as I could understand the account of the natives , he was a complete stranger to them , and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in the last stage of exhaustion . `` The man 's knapsack lay beside the couch , and I examined the contents . His name was written upon a tab within it -- Maple White , Lake Avenue , Detroit , Michigan . It is a name to which I am prepared always to lift my hat . It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned . `` From the contents of the knapsack it was evident that this man had been an artist and poet in search of effects . There were scraps of verse . I do not profess to be a judge of such things , but they appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit . There were also some rather commonplace pictures of river scenery , a paint-box , a box of colored chalks , some brushes , that curved bone which lies upon my inkstand , a volume of Baxter 's 'Moths and Butterflies , ' a cheap revolver , and a few cartridges . Of personal equipment he either had none or he had lost it in his journey . Such were the total effects of this strange American Bohemian . `` I was turning away from him when I observed that something projected from the front of his ragged jacket . It was this sketch-book , which was as dilapidated then as you see it now . Indeed , I can assure you that a first folio of Shakespeare could not be treated with greater reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession . I hand it to you now , and I ask you to take it page by page and to examine the contents . '' He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical pair of eyes , taking note of the effect which this document would produce . I had opened the volume with some expectation of a revelation , though of what nature I could not imagine . The first page was disappointing , however , as it contained nothing but the picture of a very fat man in a pea-jacket , with the legend , `` Jimmy Colver on the Mail-boat , '' written beneath it . There followed several pages which were filled with small sketches of Indians and their ways . Then came a picture of a cheerful and corpulent ecclesiastic in a shovel hat , sitting opposite a very thin European , and the inscription : `` Lunch with Fra Cristofero at Rosario . '' Studies of women and babies accounted for several more pages , and then there was an unbroken series of animal drawings with such explanations as `` Manatee upon Sandbank , '' `` Turtles and Their Eggs , '' '' Black Ajouti under a Miriti Palm '' -- the matter disclosing some sort of pig-like animal ; and finally came a double page of studies of long-snouted and very unpleasant saurians . I could make nothing of it , and said so to the Professor . `` Surely these are only crocodiles ? '' `` Alligators ! Alligators ! There is hardly such a thing as a true crocodile in South America . The distinction between them -- -- '' '' I meant that I could see nothing unusual -- nothing to justify what you have said . '' He smiled serenely . `` Try the next page , '' said he . I was still unable to sympathize . It was a full-page sketch of a landscape roughly tinted in color -- the kind of painting which an open-air artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort . There was a pale-green foreground of feathery vegetation , which sloped upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color , and curiously ribbed like some basaltic formations which I have seen . They extended in an unbroken wall right across the background . At one point was an isolated pyramidal rock , crowned by a great tree , which appeared to be separated by a cleft from the main crag . Behind it all , a blue tropical sky . A thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of the ruddy cliff . `` Well ? '' he asked . `` It is no doubt a curious formation , '' said I `` but I am not geologist enough to say that it is wonderful . '' `` Wonderful ! '' he repeated . `` It is unique . It is incredible . No one on earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility . Now the next . '' I turned it over , and gave an exclamation of surprise . There was a full-page picture of the most extraordinary creature that I had ever seen . It was the wild dream of an opium smoker , a vision of delirium . The head was like that of a fowl , the body that of a bloated lizard , the trailing tail was furnished with upward-turned spikes , and the curved back was edged with a high serrated fringe , which looked like a dozen cocks ' wattles placed behind each other . In front of this creature was an absurd mannikin , or dwarf , in human form , who stood staring at it . `` Well , what do you think of that ? '' cried the Professor , rubbing his hands with an air of triumph . `` It is monstrous -- grotesque . '' `` But what made him draw such an animal ? '' `` Trade gin , I should think . '' `` Oh , that 's the best explanation you can give , is it ? '' `` Well , sir , what is yours ? '' `` The obvious one that the creature exists . That is actually sketched from the life . '' I should have laughed only that I had a vision of our doing another Catharine-wheel down the passage . `` No doubt , '' said I , `` no doubt , '' as one humors an imbecile . `` I confess , however , '' I added , `` that this tiny human figure puzzles me . If it were an Indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in America , but it appears to be a European in a sun-hat . '' The Professor snorted like an angry buffalo . `` You really touch the limit , '' said he . `` You enlarge my view of the possible . Cerebral paresis ! Mental inertia ! Wonderful ! '' He was too absurd to make me angry . Indeed , it was a waste of energy , for if you were going to be angry with this man you would be angry all the time . I contented myself with smiling wearily . `` It struck me that the man was small , '' said I . `` Look here ! '' he cried , leaning forward and dabbing a great hairy sausage of a finger on to the picture . `` You see that plant behind the animal ; I suppose you thought it was a dandelion or a Brussels sprout -- what ? Well , it is a vegetable ivory palm , and they run to about fifty or sixty feet . Do n't you see that the man is put in for a purpose ? He could n't really have stood in front of that brute and lived to draw it . He sketched himself in to give a scale of heights . He was , we will say , over five feet high . The tree is ten times bigger , which is what one would expect . '' `` Good heavens ! '' I cried . `` Then you think the beast was -- -- Why , Charing Cross station would hardly make a kennel for such a brute ! '' `` Apart from exaggeration , he is certainly a well-grown specimen , '' said the Professor , complacently . `` But , '' I cried , `` surely the whole experience of the human race is not to be set aside on account of a single sketch '' -- I had turned over the leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the book -- '' a single sketch by a wandering American artist who may have done it under hashish , or in the delirium of fever , or simply in order to gratify a freakish imagination . You ca n't , as a man of science , defend such a position as that . '' For answer the Professor took a book down from a shelf . `` This is an excellent monograph by my gifted friend , Ray Lankester ! '' said he . `` There is an illustration here which would interest you . Ah , yes , here it is ! The inscription beneath it runs : 'Probable appearance in life of the Jurassic Dinosaur Stegosaurus . The hind leg alone is twice as tall as a full-grown man . ' Well , what do you make of that ? '' He handed me the open book . I started as I looked at the picture . In this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was certainly a very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist . `` That is certainly remarkable , '' said I . `` But you wo n't admit that it is final ? '' `` Surely it might be a coincidence , or this American may have seen a picture of the kind and carried it in his memory . It would be likely to recur to a man in a delirium . '' `` Very good , '' said the Professor , indulgently ; `` we leave it at that . I will now ask you to look at this bone . '' He handed over the one which he had already described as part of the dead man 's possessions . It was about six inches long , and thicker than my thumb , with some indications of dried cartilage at one end of it . `` To what known creature does that bone belong ? '' asked the Professor . I examined it with care and tried to recall some half-forgotten knowledge . `` It might be a very thick human collar-bone , '' I said . My companion waved his hand in contemptuous deprecation . `` The human collar-bone is curved . This is straight . There is a groove upon its surface showing that a great tendon played across it , which could not be the case with a clavicle . '' `` Then I must confess that I do n't know what it is . '' `` You need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance , for I do n't suppose the whole South Kensington staff could give a name to it . '' He took a little bone the size of a bean out of a pill-box . `` So far as I am a judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your hand . That will give you some idea of the size of the creature . You will observe from the cartilage that this is no fossil specimen , but recent . What do you say to that ? '' `` Surely in an elephant -- -- '' He winced as if in pain . `` Do n't ! Do n't talk of elephants in South America . Even in these days of Board schools -- -- '' '' Well , '' I interrupted , `` any large South American animal -- a tapir , for example . '' `` You may take it , young man , that I am versed in the elements of my business . This is not a conceivable bone either of a tapir or of any other creature known to zoology . It belongs to a very large , a very strong , and , by all analogy , a very fierce animal which exists upon the face of the earth , but has not yet come under the notice of science . You are still unconvinced ? '' `` I am at least deeply interested . '' `` Then your case is not hopeless . I feel that there is reason lurking in you somewhere , so we will patiently grope round for it . We will now leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative . You can imagine that I could hardly come away from the Amazon without probing deeper into the matter . There were indications as to the direction from which the dead traveler had come . Indian legends would alone have been my guide , for I found that rumors of a strange land were common among all the riverine tribes . You have heard , no doubt , of Curupuri ? '' `` Never . '' `` Curupuri is the spirit of the woods , something terrible , something malevolent , something to be avoided . None can describe its shape or nature , but it is a word of terror along the Amazon . Now all tribes agree as to the direction in which Curupuri lives . It was the same direction from which the American had come . Something terrible lay that way . It was my business to find out what it was . '' `` What did you do ? '' My flippancy was all gone . This massive man compelled one 's attention and respect . `` I overcame the extreme reluctance of the natives -- a reluctance which extends even to talk upon the subject -- and by judicious persuasion and gifts , aided , I will admit , by some threats of coercion , I got two of them to act as guides . After many adventures which I need not describe , and after traveling a distance which I will not mention , in a direction which I withhold , we came at last to a tract of country which has never been described , nor , indeed , visited save by my unfortunate predecessor . Would you kindly look at this ? '' He handed me a photograph -- half-plate size . `` The unsatisfactory appearance of it is due to the fact , '' said he , '' that on descending the river the boat was upset and the case which contained the undeveloped films was broken , with disastrous results . Nearly all of them were totally ruined -- an irreparable loss . This is one of the few which partially escaped . This explanation of deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept . There was talk of faking . I am not in a mood to argue such a point . '' The photograph was certainly very off-colored . An unkind critic might easily have misinterpreted that dim surface . It was a dull gray landscape , and as I gradually deciphered the details of it I realized that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly like an immense cataract seen in the distance , with a sloping , tree-clad plain in the foreground . `` I believe it is the same place as the painted picture , '' said I . `` It is the same place , '' the Professor answered . `` I found traces of the fellow 's camp . Now look at this . '' It was a nearer view of the same scene , though the photograph was extremely defective . I could distinctly see the isolated , tree-crowned pinnacle of rock which was detached from the crag . `` I have no doubt of it at all , '' said I . `` Well , that is something gained , '' said he . `` We progress , do we not ? Now , will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle ? Do you observe something there ? '' `` An enormous tree . '' `` But on the tree ? '' `` A large bird , '' said I . He handed me a lens . `` Yes , '' I said , peering through it , `` a large bird stands on the tree . It appears to have a considerable beak . I should say it was a pelican . '' `` I can not congratulate you upon your eyesight , '' said the Professor . `` It is not a pelican , nor , indeed , is it a bird . It may interest you to know that I succeeded in shooting that particular specimen . It was the only absolute proof of my experiences which I was able to bring away with me . '' `` You have it , then ? '' Here at last was tangible corroboration . `` I had it . It was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same boat accident which ruined my photographs . I clutched at it as it disappeared in the swirl of the rapids , and part of its wing was left in my hand . I was insensible when washed ashore , but the miserable remnant of my superb specimen was still intact ; I now lay it before you . '' From a drawer he produced what seemed to me to be the upper portion of the wing of a large bat . It was at least two feet in length , a curved bone , with a membranous veil beneath it . `` A monstrous bat ! '' I suggested . `` Nothing of the sort , '' said the Professor , severely . `` Living , as I do , in an educated and scientific atmosphere , I could not have conceived that the first principles of zoology were so little known . Is it possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative anatomy , that the wing of a bird is really the forearm , while the wing of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between ? Now , in this case , the bone is certainly not the forearm , and you can see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single bone , and therefore that it can not belong to a bat . But if it is neither bird nor bat , what is it ? '' My small stock of knowledge was exhausted . `` I really do not know , '' said I . He opened the standard work to which he had already referred me . `` Here , '' said he , pointing to the picture of an extraordinary flying monster , `` is an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon , or pterodactyl , a flying reptile of the Jurassic period . On the next page is a diagram of the mechanism of its wing . Kindly compare it with the specimen in your hand . '' A wave of amazement passed over me as I looked . I was convinced . There could be no getting away from it . The cumulative proof was overwhelming . The sketch , the photographs , the narrative , and now the actual specimen -- the evidence was complete . I said so -- I said so warmly , for I felt that the Professor was an ill-used man . He leaned back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile , basking in this sudden gleam of sunshine . `` It 's just the very biggest thing that I ever heard of ! '' said I , though it was my journalistic rather than my scientific enthusiasm that was roused . `` It is colossal . You are a Columbus of science who has discovered a lost world . I 'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you . It was all so unthinkable . But I understand evidence when I see it , and this should be good enough for anyone . '' The Professor purred with satisfaction . `` And then , sir , what did you do next ? '' `` It was the wet season , Mr. Malone , and my stores were exhausted . I explored some portion of this huge cliff , but I was unable to find any way to scale it . The pyramidal rock upon which I saw and shot the pterodactyl was more accessible . Being something of a cragsman , I did manage to get half way to the top of that . From that height I had a better idea of the plateau upon the top of the crags . It appeared to be very large ; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the vista of green-capped cliffs . Below , it is a swampy , jungly region , full of snakes , insects , and fever . It is a natural protection to this singular country . '' `` Did you see any other trace of life ? '' `` No , sir , I did not ; but during the week that we lay encamped at the base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above . '' `` But the creature that the American drew ? How do you account for that ? '' `` We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and seen it there . We know , therefore , that there is a way up . We know equally that it must be a very difficult one , otherwise the creatures would have come down and overrun the surrounding country . Surely that is clear ? '' `` But how did they come to be there ? '' `` I do not think that the problem is a very obscure one , '' said the Professor ; `` there can only be one explanation . South America is , as you may have heard , a granite continent . At this single point in the interior there has been , in some far distant age , a great , sudden volcanic upheaval . These cliffs , I may remark , are basaltic , and therefore plutonic . An area , as large perhaps as Sussex , has been lifted up en bloc with all its living contents , and cut off by perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from all the rest of the continent . What is the result ? Why , the ordinary laws of Nature are suspended . The various checks which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered . Creatures survive which would otherwise disappear . You will observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are Jurassic , and therefore of a great age in the order of life . They have been artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions . '' `` But surely your evidence is conclusive . You have only to lay it before the proper authorities . '' `` So in my simplicity , I had imagined , '' said the Professor , bitterly . `` I can only tell you that it was not so , that I was met at every turn by incredulity , born partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy . It is not my nature , sir , to cringe to any man , or to seek to prove a fact if my word has been doubted . After the first I have not condescended to show such corroborative proofs as I possess . The subject became hateful to me -- I would not speak of it . When men like yourself , who represent the foolish curiosity of the public , came to disturb my privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve . By nature I am , I admit , somewhat fiery , and under provocation I am inclined to be violent . I fear you may have remarked it . '' I nursed my eye and was silent . `` My wife has frequently remonstrated with me upon the subject , and yet I fancy that any man of honor would feel the same . To-night , however , I propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over the emotions . I invite you to be present at the exhibition . '' He handed me a card from his desk . `` You will perceive that Mr. Percival Waldron , a naturalist of some popular repute , is announced to lecture at eight-thirty at the Zoological Institute 's Hall upon 'The Record of the Ages . ' I have been specially invited to be present upon the platform , and to move a vote of thanks to the lecturer . While doing so , I shall make it my business , with infinite tact and delicacy , to throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter . Nothing contentious , you understand , but only an indication that there are greater deeps beyond . I shall hold myself strongly in leash , and see whether by this self-restraint I attain a more favorable result . '' `` And I may come ? '' I asked eagerly . `` Why , surely , '' he answered , cordially . He had an enormously massive genial manner , which was almost as overpowering as his violence . His smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing , when his cheeks would suddenly bunch into two red apples , between his half-closed eyes and his great black beard . `` By all means , come . It will be a comfort to me to know that I have one ally in the hall , however inefficient and ignorant of the subject he may be . I fancy there will be a large audience , for Waldron , though an absolute charlatan , has a considerable popular following . Now , Mr. Malone , I have given you rather more of my time than I had intended . The individual must not monopolize what is meant for the world . I shall be pleased to see you at the lecture to-night . In the meantime , you will understand that no public use is to be made of any of the material that I have given you . '' `` But Mr. McArdle -- my news editor , you know -- will want to know what I have done . '' `` Tell him what you like . You can say , among other things , that if he sends anyone else to intrude upon me I shall call upon him with a riding-whip . But I leave it to you that nothing of all this appears in print . Very good . Then the Zoological Institute 's Hall at eight-thirty to-night . '' I had a last impression of red cheeks , blue rippling beard , and intolerant eyes , as he waved me out of the room . CHAPTER V `` Question ! '' What with the physical shocks incidental to my first interview with Professor Challenger and the mental ones which accompanied the second , I was a somewhat demoralized journalist by the time I found myself in Enmore Park once more . In my aching head the one thought was throbbing that there really was truth in this man 's story , that it was of tremendous consequence , and that it would work up into inconceivable copy for the Gazette when I could obtain permission to use it . A taxicab was waiting at the end of the road , so I sprang into it and drove down to the office . McArdle was at his post as usual . `` Well , '' he cried , expectantly , `` what may it run to ? I 'm thinking , young man , you have been in the wars . Do n't tell me that he assaulted you . '' `` We had a little difference at first . '' `` What a man it is ! What did you do ? '' `` Well , he became more reasonable and we had a chat . But I got nothing out of him -- nothing for publication . '' `` I 'm not so sure about that . You got a black eye out of him , and that 's for publication . We ca n't have this reign of terror , Mr. Malone . We must bring the man to his bearings . I 'll have a leaderette on him to-morrow that will raise a blister . Just give me the material and I will engage to brand the fellow for ever . Professor Munchausen -- how 's that for an inset headline ? Sir John Mandeville redivivus -- Cagliostro -- all the imposters and bullies in history . I'll show him up for the fraud he is . '' `` I would n't do that , sir . '' `` Why not ? '' `` Because he is not a fraud at all . '' `` What ! '' roared McArdle . `` You do n't mean to say you really believe this stuff of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents ? '' `` Well , I do n't know about that . I do n't think he makes any claims of that kind . But I do believe he has got something new . '' `` Then for Heaven 's sake , man , write it up ! '' `` I 'm longing to , but all I know he gave me in confidence and on condition that I did n't . '' I condensed into a few sentences the Professor 's narrative . `` That 's how it stands . '' McArdle looked deeply incredulous . `` Well , Mr. Malone , '' he said at last , `` about this scientific meeting to-night ; there can be no privacy about that , anyhow . I do n't suppose any paper will want to report it , for Waldron has been reported already a dozen times , and no one is aware that Challenger will speak . We may get a scoop , if we are lucky . You 'll be there in any case , so you'll just give us a pretty full report . I 'll keep space up to midnight . '' My day was a busy one , and I had an early dinner at the Savage Club with Tarp Henry , to whom I gave some account of my adventures . He listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face , and roared with laughter on hearing that the Professor had convinced me . `` My dear chap , things do n't happen like that in real life . People do n't stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence . Leave that to the novelists . The fellow is as full of tricks as the monkey-house at the Zoo . It 's all bosh . '' `` But the American poet ? '' `` He never existed . '' `` I saw his sketch-book . '' `` Challenger 's sketch-book . '' `` You think he drew that animal ? '' `` Of course he did . Who else ? '' `` Well , then , the photographs ? '' `` There was nothing in the photographs . By your own admission you only saw a bird . '' `` A pterodactyl . '' `` That 's what HE says . He put the pterodactyl into your head . '' `` Well , then , the bones ? '' `` First one out of an Irish stew . Second one vamped up for the occasion . If you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone as easily as you can a photograph . '' I began to feel uneasy . Perhaps , after all , I had been premature in my acquiescence . Then I had a sudden happy thought . `` Will you come to the meeting ? '' I asked . Tarp Henry looked thoughtful . `` He is not a popular person , the genial Challenger , '' said he . `` A lot of people have accounts to settle with him . I should say he is about the best-hated man in London . If the medical students turn out there will be no end of a rag . I do n't want to get into a bear-garden . '' `` You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case . '' `` Well , perhaps it 's only fair . All right . I 'm your man for the evening . '' When we arrived at the hall we found a much greater concourse than I had expected . A line of electric broughams discharged their little cargoes of white-bearded professors , while the dark stream of humbler pedestrians , who crowded through the arched door-way , showed that the audience would be popular as well as scientific . Indeed , it became evident to us as soon as we had taken our seats that a youthful and even boyish spirit was abroad in the gallery and the back portions of the hall . Looking behind me , I could see rows of faces of the familiar medical student type . Apparently the great hospitals had each sent down their contingent . The behavior of the audience at present was good-humored , but mischievous . Scraps of popular songs were chorused with an enthusiasm which was a strange prelude to a scientific lecture , and there was already a tendency to personal chaff which promised a jovial evening to others , however embarrassing it might be to the recipients of these dubious honors . Thus , when old Doctor Meldrum , with his well-known curly-brimmed opera-hat , appeared upon the platform , there was such a universal query of `` Where DID you get that tile ? '' that he hurriedly removed it , and concealed it furtively under his chair . When gouty Professor Wadley limped down to his seat there were general affectionate inquiries from all parts of the hall as to the exact state of his poor toe , which caused him obvious embarrassment . The greatest demonstration of all , however , was at the entrance of my new acquaintance , Professor Challenger , when he passed down to take his place at the extreme end of the front row of the platform . Such a yell of welcome broke forth when his black beard first protruded round the corner that I began to suspect Tarp Henry was right in his surmise , and that this assemblage was there not merely for the sake of the lecture , but because it had got rumored abroad that the famous Professor would take part in the proceedings . There was some sympathetic laughter on his entrance among the front benches of well-dressed spectators , as though the demonstration of the students in this instance was not unwelcome to them . That greeting was , indeed , a frightful outburst of sound , the uproar of the carnivora cage when the step of the bucket-bearing keeper is heard in the distance . There was an offensive tone in it , perhaps , and yet in the main it struck me as mere riotous outcry , the noisy reception of one who amused and interested them , rather than of one they disliked or despised . Challenger smiled with weary and tolerant contempt , as a kindly man would meet the yapping of a litter of puppies . He sat slowly down , blew out his chest , passed his hand caressingly down his beard , and looked with drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes at the crowded hall before him . The uproar of his advent had not yet died away when Professor Ronald Murray , the chairman , and Mr. Waldron , the lecturer , threaded their way to the front , and the proceedings began . Professor Murray will , I am sure , excuse me if I say that he has the common fault of most Englishmen of being inaudible . Why on earth people who have something to say which is worth hearing should not take the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange mysteries of modern life . Their methods are as reasonable as to try to pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a non-conducting pipe , which could by the least effort be opened . Professor Murray made several profound remarks to his white tie and to the water-carafe upon the table , with a humorous , twinkling aside to the silver candlestick upon his right . Then he sat down , and Mr. Waldron , the famous popular lecturer , rose amid a general murmur of applause . He was a stern , gaunt man , with a harsh voice , and an aggressive manner , but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate the ideas of other men , and to pass them on in a way which was intelligible and even interesting to the lay public , with a happy knack of being funny about the most unlikely objects , so that the precession of the Equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly humorous process as treated by him . It was a bird's-eye view of creation , as interpreted by science , which , in language always clear and sometimes picturesque , he unfolded before us . He told us of the globe , a huge mass of flaming gas , flaring through the heavens . Then he pictured the solidification , the cooling , the wrinkling which formed the mountains , the steam which turned to water , the slow preparation of the stage upon which was to be played the inexplicable drama of life . On the origin of life itself he was discreetly vague . That the germs of it could hardly have survived the original roasting was , he declared , fairly certain . Therefore it had come later . Had it built itself out of the cooling , inorganic elements of the globe ? Very likely . Had the germs of it arrived from outside upon a meteor ? It was hardly conceivable . On the whole , the wisest man was the least dogmatic upon the point . We could not -- or at least we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our laboratories out of inorganic materials . The gulf between the dead and the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge . But there was a higher and subtler chemistry of Nature , which , working with great forces over long epochs , might well produce results which were impossible for us . There the matter must be left . This brought the lecturer to the great ladder of animal life , beginning low down in molluscs and feeble sea creatures , then up rung by rung through reptiles and fishes , till at last we came to a kangaroo-rat , a creature which brought forth its young alive , the direct ancestor of all mammals , and presumably , therefore , of everyone in the audience . ( `` No , no , '' from a sceptical student in the back row . ) If the young gentleman in the red tie who cried `` No , no , '' and who presumably claimed to have been hatched out of an egg , would wait upon him after the lecture , he would be glad to see such a curiosity . ( Laughter . ) It was strange to think that the climax of all the age-long process of Nature had been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie . But had the process stopped ? Was this gentleman to be taken as the final type -- the be-all and end-all of development ? He hoped that he would not hurt the feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that , whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life , still the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they were to end entirely in his production . Evolution was not a spent force , but one still working , and even greater achievements were in store . Having thus , amid a general titter , played very prettily with his interrupter , the lecturer went back to his picture of the past , the drying of the seas , the emergence of the sand-bank , the sluggish , viscous life which lay upon their margins , the overcrowded lagoons , the tendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the mud-flats , the abundance of food awaiting them , their consequent enormous growth . `` Hence , ladies and gentlemen , '' he added , `` that frightful brood of saurians which still affright our eyes when seen in the Wealden or in the Solenhofen slates , but which were fortunately extinct long before the first appearance of mankind upon this planet . '' `` Question ! '' boomed a voice from the platform . Mr. Waldron was a strict disciplinarian with a gift of acid humor , as exemplified upon the gentleman with the red tie , which made it perilous to interrupt him . But this interjection appeared to him so absurd that he was at a loss how to deal with it . So looks the Shakespearean who is confronted by a rancid Baconian , or the astronomer who is assailed by a flat-earth fanatic . He paused for a moment , and then , raising his voice , repeated slowly the words : `` Which were extinct before the coming of man . '' `` Question ! '' boomed the voice once more . Waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the platform until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger , who leaned back in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression , as if he were smiling in his sleep . `` I see ! '' said Waldron , with a shrug . `` It is my friend Professor Challenger , '' and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a final explanation and no more need be said . But the incident was far from being closed . Whatever path the lecturer took amid the wilds of the past seemed invariably to lead him to some assertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly brought the same bulls ' bellow from the Professor . The audience began to anticipate it and to roar with delight when it came . The packed benches of students joined in , and every time Challenger 's beard opened , before any sound could come forth , there was a yell of '' Question ! '' from a hundred voices , and an answering counter cry of '' Order ! '' and `` Shame ! '' from as many more . Waldron , though a hardened lecturer and a strong man , became rattled . He hesitated , stammered , repeated himself , got snarled in a long sentence , and finally turned furiously upon the cause of his troubles . `` This is really intolerable ! '' he cried , glaring across the platform . `` I must ask you , Professor Challenger , to cease these ignorant and unmannerly interruptions . '' There was a hush over the hall , the students rigid with delight at seeing the high gods on Olympus quarrelling among themselves . Challenger levered his bulky figure slowly out of his chair . `` I must in turn ask you , Mr. Waldron , '' he said , `` to cease to make assertions which are not in strict accordance with scientific fact . '' The words unloosed a tempest . `` Shame ! Shame ! '' `` Give him a hearing ! '' `` Put him out ! '' `` Shove him off the platform ! '' `` Fair play ! '' emerged from a general roar of amusement or execration . The chairman was on his feet flapping both his hands and bleating excitedly . `` Professor Challenger -- personal -- views -- later , '' were the solid peaks above his clouds of inaudible mutter . The interrupter bowed , smiled , stroked his beard , and relapsed into his chair . Waldron , very flushed and warlike , continued his observations . Now and then , as he made an assertion , he shot a venomous glance at his opponent , who seemed to be slumbering deeply , with the same broad , happy smile upon his face . At last the lecture came to an end -- I am inclined to think that it was a premature one , as the peroration was hurried and disconnected . The thread of the argument had been rudely broken , and the audience was restless and expectant . Waldron sat down , and , after a chirrup from the chairman , Professor Challenger rose and advanced to the edge of the platform . In the interests of my paper I took down his speech verbatim . `` Ladies and Gentlemen , '' he began , amid a sustained interruption from the back . `` I beg pardon -- Ladies , Gentlemen , and Children -- I must apologize , I had inadvertently omitted a considerable section of this audience '' ( tumult , during which the Professor stood with one hand raised and his enormous head nodding sympathetically , as if he were bestowing a pontifical blessing upon the crowd ) , `` I have been selected to move a vote of thanks to Mr. Waldron for the very picturesque and imaginative address to which we have just listened . There are points in it with which I disagree , and it has been my duty to indicate them as they arose , but , none the less , Mr. Waldron has accomplished his object well , that object being to give a simple and interesting account of what he conceives to have been the history of our planet . Popular lectures are the easiest to listen to , but Mr. Waldron '' ( here he beamed and blinked at the lecturer ) `` will excuse me when I say that they are necessarily both superficial and misleading , since they have to be graded to the comprehension of an ignorant audience . '' ( Ironical cheering . ) `` Popular lecturers are in their nature parasitic . '' ( Angry gesture of protest from Mr . Waldron . ) `` They exploit for fame or cash the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren . One smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory , one brick built into the temple of science , far outweighs any second-hand exposition which passes an idle hour , but can leave no useful result behind it . I put forward this obvious reflection , not out of any desire to disparage Mr. Waldron in particular , but that you may not lose your sense of proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest . '' ( At this point Mr. Waldron whispered to the chairman , who half rose and said something severely to his water-carafe . ) `` But enough of this ! '' ( Loud and prolonged cheers . ) `` Let me pass to some subject of wider interest . What is the particular point upon which I , as an original investigator , have challenged our lecturer 's accuracy ? It is upon the permanence of certain types of animal life upon the earth . I do not speak upon this subject as an amateur , nor , I may add , as a popular lecturer , but I speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts , when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal , therefore these creatures no longer exist . They are indeed , as he has said , our ancestors , but they are , if I may use the expression , our contemporary ancestors , who can still be found with all their hideous and formidable characteristics if one has but the energy and hardihood to seek their haunts . Creatures which were supposed to be Jurassic , monsters who would hunt down and devour our largest and fiercest mammals , still exist . '' ( Cries of `` Bosh ! '' `` Prove it ! '' `` How do YOU know ? '' `` Question ! '' ) `` How do I know , you ask me ? I know because I have visited their secret haunts . I know because I have seen some of them . '' ( Applause , uproar , and a voice , `` Liar ! '' ) `` Am I a liar ? '' ( General hearty and noisy assent . ) `` Did I hear someone say that I was a liar ? Will the person who called me a liar kindly stand up that I may know him ? '' ( A voice , `` Here he is , sir ! '' and an inoffensive little person in spectacles , struggling violently , was held up among a group of students . ) `` Did you venture to call me a liar ? '' ( `` No , sir , no ! '' shouted the accused , and disappeared like a jack-in-the-box . ) `` If any person in this hall dares to doubt my veracity , I shall be glad to have a few words with him after the lecture . '' ( `` Liar ! '' ) `` Who said that ? '' ( Again the inoffensive one plunging desperately , was elevated high into the air . ) `` If I come down among you -- -- '' ( General chorus of `` Come , love , come ! '' which interrupted the proceedings for some moments , while the chairman , standing up and waving both his arms , seemed to be conducting the music . The Professor , with his face flushed , his nostrils dilated , and his beard bristling , was now in a proper Berserk mood . ) `` Every great discoverer has been met with the same incredulity -- the sure brand of a generation of fools . When great facts are laid before you , you have not the intuition , the imagination which would help you to understand them . You can only throw mud at the men who have risked their lives to open new fields to science . You persecute the prophets ! Galileo ! Darwin , and I -- -- '' ( Prolonged cheering and complete interruption . ) All this is from my hurried notes taken at the time , which give little notion of the absolute chaos to which the assembly had by this time been reduced . So terrific was the uproar that several ladies had already beaten a hurried retreat . Grave and reverend seniors seemed to have caught the prevailing spirit as badly as the students , and I saw white-bearded men rising and shaking their fists at the obdurate Professor . The whole great audience seethed and simmered like a boiling pot . The Professor took a step forward and raised both his hands . There was something so big and arresting and virile in the man that the clatter and shouting died gradually away before his commanding gesture and his masterful eyes . He seemed to have a definite message . They hushed to hear it . `` I will not detain you , '' he said . `` It is not worth it . Truth is truth , and the noise of a number of foolish young men -- and , I fear I must add , of their equally foolish seniors -- can not affect the matter . I claim that I have opened a new field of science . You dispute it . '' ( Cheers . ) `` Then I put you to the test . Will you accredit one or more of your own number to go out as your representatives and test my statement in your name ? '' Mr. Summerlee , the veteran Professor of Comparative Anatomy , rose among the audience , a tall , thin , bitter man , with the withered aspect of a theologian . He wished , he said , to ask Professor Challenger whether the results to which he had alluded in his remarks had been obtained during a journey to the headwaters of the Amazon made by him two years before . Professor Challenger answered that they had . Mr. Summerlee desired to know how it was that Professor Challenger claimed to have made discoveries in those regions which had been overlooked by Wallace , Bates , and other previous explorers of established scientific repute . Professor Challenger answered that Mr. Summerlee appeared to be confusing the Amazon with the Thames ; that it was in reality a somewhat larger river ; that Mr. Summerlee might be interested to know that with the Orinoco , which communicated with it , some fifty thousand miles of country were opened up , and that in so vast a space it was not impossible for one person to find what another had missed . Mr. Summerlee declared , with an acid smile , that he fully appreciated the difference between the Thames and the Amazon , which lay in the fact that any assertion about the former could be tested , while about the latter it could not . He would be obliged if Professor Challenger would give the latitude and the longitude of the country in which prehistoric animals were to be found . Professor Challenger replied that he reserved such information for good reasons of his own , but would be prepared to give it with proper precautions to a committee chosen from the audience . Would Mr. Summerlee serve on such a committee and test his story in person ? Mr. Summerlee : `` Yes , I will . '' ( Great cheering . ) Professor Challenger : `` Then I guarantee that I will place in your hands such material as will enable you to find your way . It is only right , however , since Mr. Summerlee goes to check my statement that I should have one or more with him who may check his . I will not disguise from you that there are difficulties and dangers . Mr. Summerlee will need a younger colleague . May I ask for volunteers ? '' It is thus that the great crisis of a man 's life springs out at him . Could I have imagined when I entered that hall that I was about to pledge myself to a wilder adventure than had ever come to me in my dreams ? But Gladys -- was it not the very opportunity of which she spoke ? Gladys would have told me to go . I had sprung to my feet . I was speaking , and yet I had prepared no words . Tarp Henry , my companion , was plucking at my skirts and I heard him whispering , `` Sit down , Malone ! Do n't make a public ass of yourself . '' At the same time I was aware that a tall , thin man , with dark gingery hair , a few seats in front of me , was also upon his feet . He glared back at me with hard angry eyes , but I refused to give way . `` I will go , Mr. Chairman , '' I kept repeating over and over again . `` Name ! Name ! '' cried the audience . `` My name is Edward Dunn Malone . I am the reporter of the Daily Gazette . I claim to be an absolutely unprejudiced witness . '' `` What is YOUR name , sir ? '' the chairman asked of my tall rival . `` I am Lord John Roxton . I have already been up the Amazon , I know all the ground , and have special qualifications for this investigation . '' `` Lord John Roxton 's reputation as a sportsman and a traveler is , of course , world-famous , '' said the chairman ; `` at the same time it would certainly be as well to have a member of the Press upon such an expedition . '' `` Then I move , '' said Professor Challenger , `` that both these gentlemen be elected , as representatives of this meeting , to accompany Professor Summerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth of my statements . '' And so , amid shouting and cheering , our fate was decided , and I found myself borne away in the human current which swirled towards the door , with my mind half stunned by the vast new project which had risen so suddenly before it . As I emerged from the hall I was conscious for a moment of a rush of laughing students -- down the pavement , and of an arm wielding a heavy umbrella , which rose and fell in the midst of them . Then , amid a mixture of groans and cheers , Professor Challenger's electric brougham slid from the curb , and I found myself walking under the silvery lights of Regent Street , full of thoughts of Gladys and of wonder as to my future . Suddenly there was a touch at my elbow . I turned , and found myself looking into the humorous , masterful eyes of the tall , thin man who had volunteered to be my companion on this strange quest . `` Mr. Malone , I understand , '' said he . `` We are to be companions -- what ? My rooms are just over the road , in the Albany . Perhaps you would have the kindness to spare me half an hour , for there are one or two things that I badly want to say to you . '' CHAPTER VI `` I was the Flail of the Lord '' Lord John Roxton and I turned down Vigo Street together and through the dingy portals of the famous aristocratic rookery . At the end of a long drab passage my new acquaintance pushed open a door and turned on an electric switch . A number of lamps shining through tinted shades bathed the whole great room before us in a ruddy radiance . Standing in the doorway and glancing round me , I had a general impression of extraordinary comfort and elegance combined with an atmosphere of masculine virility . Everywhere there were mingled the luxury of the wealthy man of taste and the careless untidiness of the bachelor . Rich furs and strange iridescent mats from some Oriental bazaar were scattered upon the floor . Pictures and prints which even my unpractised eyes could recognize as being of great price and rarity hung thick upon the walls . Sketches of boxers , of ballet-girls , and of racehorses alternated with a sensuous Fragonard , a martial Girardet , and a dreamy Turner . But amid these varied ornaments there were scattered the trophies which brought back strongly to my recollection the fact that Lord John Roxton was one of the great all-round sportsmen and athletes of his day . A dark-blue oar crossed with a cherry-pink one above his mantel-piece spoke of the old Oxonian and Leander man , while the foils and boxing-gloves above and below them were the tools of a man who had won supremacy with each . Like a dado round the room was the jutting line of splendid heavy game-heads , the best of their sort from every quarter of the world , with the rare white rhinoceros of the Lado Enclave drooping its supercilious lip above them all . In the center of the rich red carpet was a black and gold Louis Quinze table , a lovely antique , now sacrilegiously desecrated with marks of glasses and the scars of cigar-stumps . On it stood a silver tray of smokables and a burnished spirit-stand , from which and an adjacent siphon my silent host proceeded to charge two high glasses . Having indicated an arm-chair to me and placed my refreshment near it , he handed me a long , smooth Havana . Then , seating himself opposite to me , he looked at me long and fixedly with his strange , twinkling , reckless eyes -- eyes of a cold light blue , the color of a glacier lake . Through the thin haze of my cigar-smoke I noted the details of a face which was already familiar to me from many photographs -- the strongly-curved nose , the hollow , worn cheeks , the dark , ruddy hair , thin at the top , the crisp , virile moustaches , the small , aggressive tuft upon his projecting chin . Something there was of Napoleon III. , something of Don Quixote , and yet again something which was the essence of the English country gentleman , the keen , alert , open-air lover of dogs and of horses . His skin was of a rich flower-pot red from sun and wind . His eyebrows were tufted and overhanging , which gave those naturally cold eyes an almost ferocious aspect , an impression which was increased by his strong and furrowed brow . In figure he was spare , but very strongly built -- indeed , he had often proved that there were few men in England capable of such sustained exertions . His height was a little over six feet , but he seemed shorter on account of a peculiar rounding of the shoulders . Such was the famous Lord John Roxton as he sat opposite to me , biting hard upon his cigar and watching me steadily in a long and embarrassing silence . `` Well , '' said he , at last , `` we 've gone and done it , young fellah my lad . '' ( This curious phrase he pronounced as if it were all one word -- '' young-fellah-me-lad . '' ) `` Yes , we 've taken a jump , you an ' me . I suppose , now , when you went into that room there was no such notion in your head -- what ? '' `` No thought of it . '' `` The same here . No thought of it . And here we are , up to our necks in the tureen . Why , I 've only been back three weeks from Uganda , and taken a place in Scotland , and signed the lease and all . Pretty goin's on -- what ? How does it hit you ? '' `` Well , it is all in the main line of my business . I am a journalist on the Gazette . '' `` Of course -- you said so when you took it on . By the way , I 've got a small job for you , if you 'll help me . '' `` With pleasure . '' `` Do n't mind takin ' a risk , do you ? '' `` What is the risk ? '' `` Well , it 's Ballinger -- he 's the risk . You 've heard of him ? '' `` No . '' `` Why , young fellah , where HAVE you lived ? Sir John Ballinger is the best gentleman jock in the north country . I could hold him on the flat at my best , but over jumps he 's my master . Well , it 's an open secret that when he 's out of trainin ' he drinks hard -- strikin ' an average , he calls it . He got delirium on Toosday , and has been ragin ' like a devil ever since . His room is above this . The doctors say that it is all up with the old dear unless some food is got into him , but as he lies in bed with a revolver on his coverlet , and swears he will put six of the best through anyone that comes near him , there 's been a bit of a strike among the serving-men . He 's a hard nail , is Jack , and a dead shot , too , but you ca n't leave a Grand National winner to die like that -- what ? '' `` What do you mean to do , then ? '' I asked . `` Well , my idea was that you and I could rush him . He may be dozin ' , and at the worst he can only wing one of us , and the other should have him . If we can get his bolster-cover round his arms and then 'phone up a stomach-pump , we 'll give the old dear the supper of his life . '' It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into one 's day's work . I do n't think that I am a particularly brave man . I have an Irish imagination which makes the unknown and the untried more terrible than they are . On the other hand , I was brought up with a horror of cowardice and with a terror of such a stigma . I dare say that I could throw myself over a precipice , like the Hun in the history books , if my courage to do it were questioned , and yet it would surely be pride and fear , rather than courage , which would be my inspiration . Therefore , although every nerve in my body shrank from the whisky-maddened figure which I pictured in the room above , I still answered , in as careless a voice as I could command , that I was ready to go . Some further remark of Lord Roxton 's about the danger only made me irritable . `` Talking wo n't make it any better , '' said I . `` Come on . '' I rose from my chair and he from his . Then with a little confidential chuckle of laughter , he patted me two or three times on the chest , finally pushing me back into my chair . `` All right , sonny my lad -- you 'll do , '' said he . I looked up in surprise . `` I saw after Jack Ballinger myself this mornin ' . He blew a hole in the skirt of my kimono , bless his shaky old hand , but we got a jacket on him , and he 's to be all right in a week . I say , young fellah , I hope you do n't mind -- what ? You see , between you an ' me close-tiled , I look on this South American business as a mighty serious thing , and if I have a pal with me I want a man I can bank on . So I sized you down , and I 'm bound to say that you came well out of it . You see , it 's all up to you and me , for this old Summerlee man will want dry-nursin ' from the first . By the way , are you by any chance the Malone who is expected to get his Rugby cap for Ireland ? '' `` A reserve , perhaps . '' `` I thought I remembered your face . Why , I was there when you got that try against Richmond -- as fine a swervin ' run as I saw the whole season . I never miss a Rugby match if I can help it , for it is the manliest game we have left . Well , I did n't ask you in here just to talk sport . We 've got to fix our business . Here are the sailin 's , on the first page of the Times . There 's a Booth boat for Para next Wednesday week , and if the Professor and you can work it , I think we should take it -- what ? Very good , I 'll fix it with him . What about your outfit ? '' `` My paper will see to that . '' `` Can you shoot ? '' `` About average Territorial standard . '' `` Good Lord ! as bad as that ? It 's the last thing you young fellahs think of learnin ' . You 're all bees without stings , so far as lookin' after the hive goes . You 'll look silly , some o ' these days , when someone comes along an ' sneaks the honey . But you 'll need to hold your gun straight in South America , for , unless our friend the Professor is a madman or a liar , we may see some queer things before we get back . What gun have you ? '' He crossed to an oaken cupboard , and as he threw it open I caught a glimpse of glistening rows of parallel barrels , like the pipes of an organ . `` I 'll see what I can spare you out of my own battery , '' said he . One by one he took out a succession of beautiful rifles , opening and shutting them with a snap and a clang , and then patting them as he put them back into the rack as tenderly as a mother would fondle her children . `` This is a Bland 's .577 axite express , '' said he . `` I got that big fellow with it . '' He glanced up at the white rhinoceros . `` Ten more yards , and he 'd would have added me to HIS collection . 'On that conical bullet his one chance hangs , 'T is the weak one 's advantage fair . ' Hope you know your Gordon , for he 's the poet of the horse and the gun and the man that handles both . Now , here 's a useful tool -- .470 , telescopic sight , double ejector , point-blank up to three-fifty . That 's the rifle I used against the Peruvian slave-drivers three years ago . I was the flail of the Lord up in those parts , I may tell you , though you wo n't find it in any Blue-book . There are times , young fellah , when every one of us must make a stand for human right and justice , or you never feel clean again . That 's why I made a little war on my own . Declared it myself , waged it myself , ended it myself . Each of those nicks is for a slave murderer -- a good row of them -- what ? That big one is for Pedro Lopez , the king of them all , that I killed in a backwater of the Putomayo River . Now , here 's something that would do for you . '' He took out a beautiful brown-and-silver rifle . `` Well rubbered at the stock , sharply sighted , five cartridges to the clip . You can trust your life to that . '' He handed it to me and closed the door of his oak cabinet . `` By the way , '' he continued , coming back to his chair , `` what do you know of this Professor Challenger ? '' `` I never saw him till to-day . '' `` Well , neither did I . It 's funny we should both sail under sealed orders from a man we do n't know . He seemed an uppish old bird . His brothers of science do n't seem too fond of him , either . How came you to take an interest in the affair ? '' I told him shortly my experiences of the morning , and he listened intently . Then he drew out a map of South America and laid it on the table . `` I believe every single word he said to you was the truth , '' said he , earnestly , `` and , mind you , I have something to go on when I speak like that . South America is a place I love , and I think , if you take it right through from Darien to Fuego , it 's the grandest , richest , most wonderful bit of earth upon this planet . People do n't know it yet , and do n't realize what it may become . I 've been up an ' down it from end to end , and had two dry seasons in those very parts , as I told you when I spoke of the war I made on the slave-dealers . Well , when I was up there I heard some yarns of the same kind -- traditions of Indians and the like , but with somethin ' behind them , no doubt . The more you knew of that country , young fellah , the more you would understand that anythin ' was possible -- ANYTHIN ' ! There are just some narrow water-lanes along which folk travel , and outside that it is all darkness . Now , down here in the Matto Grande '' -- he swept his cigar over a part of the map -- '' or up in this corner where three countries meet , nothin ' would surprise me . As that chap said to-night , there are fifty-thousand miles of water-way runnin ' through a forest that is very near the size of Europe . You and I could be as far away from each other as Scotland is from Constantinople , and yet each of us be in the same great Brazilian forest . Man has just made a track here and a scrape there in the maze . Why , the river rises and falls the best part of forty feet , and half the country is a morass that you ca n't pass over . Why should n't somethin ' new and wonderful lie in such a country ? And why should n't we be the men to find it out ? Besides , '' he added , his queer , gaunt face shining with delight , `` there 's a sportin ' risk in every mile of it . I 'm like an old golf-ball -- I 've had all the white paint knocked off me long ago . Life can whack me about now , and it ca n't leave a mark . But a sportin ' risk , young fellah , that 's the salt of existence . Then it 's worth livin ' again . We 're all gettin ' a deal too soft and dull and comfy . Give me the great waste lands and the wide spaces , with a gun in my fist and somethin ' to look for that's worth findin ' . I 've tried war and steeplechasin ' and aeroplanes , but this huntin ' of beasts that look like a lobster-supper dream is a brand-new sensation . '' He chuckled with glee at the prospect . Perhaps I have dwelt too long upon this new acquaintance , but he is to be my comrade for many a day , and so I have tried to set him down as I first saw him , with his quaint personality and his queer little tricks of speech and of thought . It was only the need of getting in the account of my meeting which drew me at last from his company . I left him seated amid his pink radiance , oiling the lock of his favorite rifle , while he still chuckled to himself at the thought of the adventures which awaited us . It was very clear to me that if dangers lay before us I could not in all England have found a cooler head or a braver spirit with which to share them . That night , wearied as I was after the wonderful happenings of the day , I sat late with McArdle , the news editor , explaining to him the whole situation , which he thought important enough to bring next morning before the notice of Sir George Beaumont , the chief . It was agreed that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of successive letters to McArdle , and that these should either be edited for the Gazette as they arrived , or held back to be published later , according to the wishes of Professor Challenger , since we could not yet know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should guide us to the unknown land . In response to a telephone inquiry , we received nothing more definite than a fulmination against the Press , ending up with the remark that if we would notify our boat he would hand us any directions which he might think it proper to give us at the moment of starting . A second question from us failed to elicit any answer at all , save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that her husband was in a very violent temper already , and that she hoped we would do nothing to make it worse . A third attempt , later in the day , provoked a terrific crash , and a subsequent message from the Central Exchange that Professor Challenger 's receiver had been shattered . After that we abandoned all attempt at communication . And now my patient readers , I can address you directly no longer . From now onwards ( if , indeed , any continuation of this narrative should ever reach you ) it can only be through the paper which I represent . In the hands of the editor I leave this account of the events which have led up to one of the most remarkable expeditions of all time , so that if I never return to England there shall be some record as to how the affair came about . I am writing these last lines in the saloon of the Booth liner Francisca , and they will go back by the pilot to the keeping of Mr. McArdle . Let me draw one last picture before I close the notebook -- a picture which is the last memory of the old country which I bear away with me . It is a wet , foggy morning in the late spring ; a thin , cold rain is falling . Three shining mackintoshed figures are walking down the quay , making for the gang-plank of the great liner from which the blue-peter is flying . In front of them a porter pushes a trolley piled high with trunks , wraps , and gun-cases . Professor Summerlee , a long , melancholy figure , walks with dragging steps and drooping head , as one who is already profoundly sorry for himself . Lord John Roxton steps briskly , and his thin , eager face beams forth between his hunting-cap and his muffler . As for myself , I am glad to have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leave-taking behind me , and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing . Suddenly , just as we reach the vessel , there is a shout behind us . It is Professor Challenger , who had promised to see us off . He runs after us , a puffing , red-faced , irascible figure . `` No thank you , '' says he ; `` I should much prefer not to go aboard . I have only a few words to say to you , and they can very well be said where we are . I beg you not to imagine that I am in any way indebted to you for making this journey . I would have you to understand that it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , and I refuse to entertain the most remote sense of personal obligation . Truth is truth , and nothing which you can report can affect it in any way , though it may excite the emotions and allay the curiosity of a number of very ineffectual people . My directions for your instruction and guidance are in this sealed envelope . You will open it when you reach a town upon the Amazon which is called Manaos , but not until the date and hour which is marked upon the outside . Have I made myself clear ? I leave the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor . No , Mr. Malone , I will place no restriction upon your correspondence , since the ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey ; but I demand that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination , and that nothing be actually published until your return . Good-bye , sir . You have done something to mitigate my feelings for the loathsome profession to which you unhappily belong . Good-bye , Lord John . Science is , as I understand , a sealed book to you ; but you may congratulate yourself upon the hunting-field which awaits you . You will , no doubt , have the opportunity of describing in the Field how you brought down the rocketing dimorphodon . And good-bye to you also , Professor Summerlee . If you are still capable of self-improvement , of which I am frankly unconvinced , you will surely return to London a wiser man . '' So he turned upon his heel , and a minute later from the deck I could see his short , squat figure bobbing about in the distance as he made his way back to his train . Well , we are well down Channel now . There 's the last bell for letters , and it 's good-bye to the pilot . We 'll be `` down , hull-down , on the old trail '' from now on . God bless all we leave behind us , and send us safely back . CHAPTER VII `` To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown '' I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner , nor will I tell of our week 's stay at Para ( save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment ) . I will also allude very briefly to our river journey , up a wide , slow-moving , clay-tinted stream , in a steamer which was little smaller than that which had carried us across the Atlantic . Eventually we found ourselves through the narrows of Obidos and reached the town of Manaos . Here we were rescued from the limited attractions of the local inn by Mr. Shortman , the representative of the British and Brazilian Trading Company . In his hospitable Fazenda we spent our time until the day when we were empowered to open the letter of instructions given to us by Professor Challenger . Before I reach the surprising events of that date I would desire to give a clearer sketch of my comrades in this enterprise , and of the associates whom we had already gathered together in South America . I speak freely , and I leave the use of my material to your own discretion , Mr. McArdle , since it is through your hands that this report must pass before it reaches the world . The scientific attainments of Professor Summerlee are too well known for me to trouble to recapitulate them . He is better equipped for a rough expedition of this sort than one would imagine at first sight . His tall , gaunt , stringy figure is insensible to fatigue , and his dry , half-sarcastic , and often wholly unsympathetic manner is uninfluenced by any change in his surroundings . Though in his sixty-sixth year , I have never heard him express any dissatisfaction at the occasional hardships which we have had to encounter . I had regarded his presence as an encumbrance to the expedition , but , as a matter of fact , I am now well convinced that his power of endurance is as great as my own . In temper he is naturally acid and sceptical . From the beginning he has never concealed his belief that Professor Challenger is an absolute fraud , that we are all embarked upon an absurd wild-goose chase and that we are likely to reap nothing but disappointment and danger in South America , and corresponding ridicule in England . Such are the views which , with much passionate distortion of his thin features and wagging of his thin , goat-like beard , he poured into our ears all the way from Southampton to Manaos . Since landing from the boat he has obtained some consolation from the beauty and variety of the insect and bird life around him , for he is absolutely whole-hearted in his devotion to science . He spends his days flitting through the woods with his shot-gun and his butterfly-net , and his evenings in mounting the many specimens he has acquired . Among his minor peculiarities are that he is careless as to his attire , unclean in his person , exceedingly absent-minded in his habits , and addicted to smoking a short briar pipe , which is seldom out of his mouth . He has been upon several scientific expeditions in his youth ( he was with Robertson in Papua ) , and the life of the camp and the canoe is nothing fresh to him . Lord John Roxton has some points in common with Professor Summerlee , and others in which they are the very antithesis to each other . He is twenty years younger , but has something of the same spare , scraggy physique . As to his appearance , I have , as I recollect , described it in that portion of my narrative which I have left behind me in London . He is exceedingly neat and prim in his ways , dresses always with great care in white drill suits and high brown mosquito-boots , and shaves at least once a day . Like most men of action , he is laconic in speech , and sinks readily into his own thoughts , but he is always quick to answer a question or join in a conversation , talking in a queer , jerky , half-humorous fashion . His knowledge of the world , and very especially of South America , is surprising , and he has a whole-hearted belief in the possibilities of our journey which is not to be dashed by the sneers of Professor Summerlee . He has a gentle voice and a quiet manner , but behind his twinkling blue eyes there lurks a capacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution , the more dangerous because they are held in leash . He spoke little of his own exploits in Brazil and Peru , but it was a revelation to me to find the excitement which was caused by his presence among the riverine natives , who looked upon him as their champion and protector . The exploits of the Red Chief , as they called him , had become legends among them , but the real facts , as far as I could learn them , were amazing enough . These were that Lord John had found himself some years before in that no-man's-land which is formed by the half-defined frontiers between Peru , Brazil , and Columbia . In this great district the wild rubber tree flourishes , and has become , as in the Congo , a curse to the natives which can only be compared to their forced labor under the Spaniards upon the old silver mines of Darien . A handful of villainous half-breeds dominated the country , armed such Indians as would support them , and turned the rest into slaves , terrorizing them with the most inhuman tortures in order to force them to gather the india-rubber , which was then floated down the river to Para . Lord John Roxton expostulated on behalf of the wretched victims , and received nothing but threats and insults for his pains . He then formally declared war against Pedro Lopez , the leader of the slave-drivers , enrolled a band of runaway slaves in his service , armed them , and conducted a campaign , which ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious half-breed and breaking down the system which he represented . No wonder that the ginger-headed man with the silky voice and the free and easy manners was now looked upon with deep interest upon the banks of the great South American river , though the feelings he inspired were naturally mixed , since the gratitude of the natives was equaled by the resentment of those who desired to exploit them . One useful result of his former experiences was that he could talk fluently in the Lingoa Geral , which is the peculiar talk , one-third Portuguese and two-thirds Indian , which is current all over Brazil . I have said before that Lord John Roxton was a South Americomaniac . He could not speak of that great country without ardor , and this ardor was infectious , for , ignorant as I was , he fixed my attention and stimulated my curiosity . How I wish I could reproduce the glamour of his discourses , the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of racy imagination which gave them their fascination , until even the Professor 's cynical and sceptical smile would gradually vanish from his thin face as he listened . He would tell the history of the mighty river so rapidly explored ( for some of the first conquerors of Peru actually crossed the entire continent upon its waters ) , and yet so unknown in regard to all that lay behind its ever-changing banks . `` What is there ? '' he would cry , pointing to the north . `` Wood and marsh and unpenetrated jungle . Who knows what it may shelter ? And there to the south ? A wilderness of swampy forest , where no white man has ever been . The unknown is up against us on every side . Outside the narrow lines of the rivers what does anyone know ? Who will say what is possible in such a country ? Why should old man Challenger not be right ? '' At which direct defiance the stubborn sneer would reappear upon Professor Summerlee 's face , and he would sit , shaking his sardonic head in unsympathetic silence , behind the cloud of his briar-root pipe . So much , for the moment , for my two white companions , whose characters and limitations will be further exposed , as surely as my own , as this narrative proceeds . But already we have enrolled certain retainers who may play no small part in what is to come . The first is a gigantic negro named Zambo , who is a black Hercules , as willing as any horse , and about as intelligent . Him we enlisted at Para , on the recommendation of the steamship company , on whose vessels he had learned to speak a halting English . It was at Para also that we engaged Gomez and Manuel , two half-breeds from up the river , just come down with a cargo of redwood . They were swarthy fellows , bearded and fierce , as active and wiry as panthers . Both of them had spent their lives in those upper waters of the Amazon which we were about to explore , and it was this recommendation which had caused Lord John to engage them . One of them , Gomez , had the further advantage that he could speak excellent English . These men were willing to act as our personal servants , to cook , to row , or to make themselves useful in any way at a payment of fifteen dollars a month . Besides these , we had engaged three Mojo Indians from Bolivia , who are the most skilful at fishing and boat work of all the river tribes . The chief of these we called Mojo , after his tribe , and the others are known as Jose and Fernando . Three white men , then , two half-breeds , one negro , and three Indians made up the personnel of the little expedition which lay waiting for its instructions at Manaos before starting upon its singular quest . At last , after a weary week , the day had come and the hour . I ask you to picture the shaded sitting-room of the Fazenda St. Ignatio , two miles inland from the town of Manaos . Outside lay the yellow , brassy glare of the sunshine , with the shadows of the palm trees as black and definite as the trees themselves . The air was calm , full of the eternal hum of insects , a tropical chorus of many octaves , from the deep drone of the bee to the high , keen pipe of the mosquito . Beyond the veranda was a small cleared garden , bounded with cactus hedges and adorned with clumps of flowering shrubs , round which the great blue butterflies and the tiny humming-birds fluttered and darted in crescents of sparkling light . Within we were seated round the cane table , on which lay a sealed envelope . Inscribed upon it , in the jagged handwriting of Professor Challenger , were the words : -- '' Instructions to Lord John Roxton and party . To be opened at Manaos upon July 15th , at 12 o'clock precisely . '' Lord John had placed his watch upon the table beside him . `` We have seven more minutes , '' said he . `` The old dear is very precise . '' Professor Summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in his gaunt hand . `` What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven minutes ? '' said he . `` It is all part and parcel of the same system of quackery and nonsense , for which I regret to say that the writer is notorious . '' `` Oh , come , we must play the game accordin ' to rules , '' said Lord John . `` It 's old man Challenger 's show and we are here by his good will , so it would be rotten bad form if we did n't follow his instructions to the letter . '' `` A pretty business it is ! '' cried the Professor , bitterly . `` It struck me as preposterous in London , but I 'm bound to say that it seems even more so upon closer acquaintance . I do n't know what is inside this envelope , but , unless it is something pretty definite , I shall be much tempted to take the next down-river boat and catch the Bolivia at Para . After all , I have some more responsible work in the world than to run about disproving the assertions of a lunatic . Now , Roxton , surely it is time . '' `` Time it is , '' said Lord John . `` You can blow the whistle . '' He took up the envelope and cut it with his penknife . From it he drew a folded sheet of paper . This he carefully opened out and flattened on the table . It was a blank sheet . He turned it over . Again it was blank . We looked at each other in a bewildered silence , which was broken by a discordant burst of derisive laughter from Professor Summerlee . `` It is an open admission , '' he cried . `` What more do you want ? The fellow is a self-confessed humbug . We have only to return home and report him as the brazen imposter that he is . '' `` Invisible ink ! '' I suggested . `` I do n't think ! '' said Lord Roxton , holding the paper to the light . `` No , young fellah my lad , there is no use deceiving yourself . I 'll go bail for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper . '' `` May I come in ? '' boomed a voice from the veranda . The shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the patch of sunlight . That voice ! That monstrous breadth of shoulder ! We sprang to our feet with a gasp of astonishment as Challenger , in a round , boyish straw-hat with a colored ribbon -- Challenger , with his hands in his jacket-pockets and his canvas shoes daintily pointing as he walked -- appeared in the open space before us . He threw back his head , and there he stood in the golden glow with all his old Assyrian luxuriance of beard , all his native insolence of drooping eyelids and intolerant eyes . `` I fear , '' said he , taking out his watch , `` that I am a few minutes too late . When I gave you this envelope I must confess that I had never intended that you should open it , for it had been my fixed intention to be with you before the hour . The unfortunate delay can be apportioned between a blundering pilot and an intrusive sandbank . I fear that it has given my colleague , Professor Summerlee , occasion to blaspheme . '' `` I am bound to say , sir , '' said Lord John , with some sternness of voice , '' that your turning up is a considerable relief to us , for our mission seemed to have come to a premature end . Even now I ca n't for the life of me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a manner . '' Instead of answering , Professor Challenger entered , shook hands with myself and Lord John , bowed with ponderous insolence to Professor Summerlee , and sank back into a basket-chair , which creaked and swayed beneath his weight . `` Is all ready for your journey ? '' he asked . `` We can start to-morrow . '' `` Then so you shall . You need no chart of directions now , since you will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance . From the first I had determined that I would myself preside over your investigation . The most elaborate charts would , as you will readily admit , be a poor substitute for my own intelligence and advice . As to the small ruse which I played upon you in the matter of the envelope , it is clear that , had I told you all my intentions , I should have been forced to resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you . '' `` Not from me , sir ! '' exclaimed Professor Summerlee , heartily . `` So long as there was another ship upon the Atlantic . '' Challenger waved him away with his great hairy hand . `` Your common sense will , I am sure , sustain my objection and realize that it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear only at the exact moment when my presence was needed . That moment has now arrived . You are in safe hands . You will not now fail to reach your destination . From henceforth I take command of this expedition , and I must ask you to complete your preparations to-night , so that we may be able to make an early start in the morning . My time is of value , and the same thing may be said , no doubt , in a lesser degree of your own . I propose , therefore , that we push on as rapidly as possible , until I have demonstrated what you have come to see . '' Lord John Roxton has chartered a large steam launch , the Esmeralda , which was to carry us up the river . So far as climate goes , it was immaterial what time we chose for our expedition , as the temperature ranges from seventy-five to ninety degrees both summer and winter , with no appreciable difference in heat . In moisture , however , it is otherwise ; from December to May is the period of the rains , and during this time the river slowly rises until it attains a height of nearly forty feet above its low-water mark . It floods the banks , extends in great lagoons over a monstrous waste of country , and forms a huge district , called locally the Gapo , which is for the most part too marshy for foot-travel and too shallow for boating . About June the waters begin to fall , and are at their lowest at October or November . Thus our expedition was at the time of the dry season , when the great river and its tributaries were more or less in a normal condition . The current of the river is a slight one , the drop being not greater than eight inches in a mile . No stream could be more convenient for navigation , since the prevailing wind is south-east , and sailing boats may make a continuous progress to the Peruvian frontier , dropping down again with the current . In our own case the excellent engines of the Esmeralda could disregard the sluggish flow of the stream , and we made as rapid progress as if we were navigating a stagnant lake . For three days we steamed north-westwards up a stream which even here , a thousand miles from its mouth , was still so enormous that from its center the two banks were mere shadows upon the distant skyline . On the fourth day after leaving Manaos we turned into a tributary which at its mouth was little smaller than the main stream . It narrowed rapidly , however , and after two more days ' steaming we reached an Indian village , where the Professor insisted that we should land , and that the Esmeralda should be sent back to Manaos . We should soon come upon rapids , he explained , which would make its further use impossible . He added privately that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country , and that the fewer whom we took into our confidence the better it would be . To this end also he made each of us give our word of honor that we would publish or say nothing which would give any exact clue as to the whereabouts of our travels , while the servants were all solemnly sworn to the same effect . It is for this reason that I am compelled to be vague in my narrative , and I would warn my readers that in any map or diagram which I may give the relation of places to each other may be correct , but the points of the compass are carefully confused , so that in no way can it be taken as an actual guide to the country . Professor Challenger 's reasons for secrecy may be valid or not , but we had no choice but to adopt them , for he was prepared to abandon the whole expedition rather than modify the conditions upon which he would guide us . It was August 2nd when we snapped our last link with the outer world by bidding farewell to the Esmeralda . Since then four days have passed , during which we have engaged two large canoes from the Indians , made of so light a material ( skins over a bamboo framework ) that we should be able to carry them round any obstacle . These we have loaded with all our effects , and have engaged two additional Indians to help us in the navigation . I understand that they are the very two -- Ataca and Ipetu by name -- who accompanied Professor Challenger upon his previous journey . They appeared to be terrified at the prospect of repeating it , but the chief has patriarchal powers in these countries , and if the bargain is good in his eyes the clansman has little choice in the matter . So to-morrow we disappear into the unknown . This account I am transmitting down the river by canoe , and it may be our last word to those who are interested in our fate . I have , according to our arrangement , addressed it to you , my dear Mr. McArdle , and I leave it to your discretion to delete , alter , or do what you like with it . From the assurance of Professor Challenger 's manner -- and in spite of the continued scepticism of Professor Summerlee -- I have no doubt that our leader will make good his statement , and that we are really on the eve of some most remarkable experiences . CHAPTER VIII `` The Outlying Pickets of the New World '' Our friends at home may well rejoice with us , for we are at our goal , and up to a point , at least , we have shown that the statement of Professor Challenger can be verified . We have not , it is true , ascended the plateau , but it lies before us , and even Professor Summerlee is in a more chastened mood . Not that he will for an instant admit that his rival could be right , but he is less persistent in his incessant objections , and has sunk for the most part into an observant silence . I must hark back , however , and continue my narrative from where I dropped it . We are sending home one of our local Indians who is injured , and I am committing this letter to his charge , with considerable doubts in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand . When I wrote last we were about to leave the Indian village where we had been deposited by the Esmeralda . I have to begin my report by bad news , for the first serious personal trouble ( I pass over the incessant bickerings between the Professors ) occurred this evening , and might have had a tragic ending . I have spoken of our English-speaking half-breed , Gomez -- a fine worker and a willing fellow , but afflicted , I fancy , with the vice of curiosity , which is common enough among such men . On the last evening he seems to have hid himself near the hut in which we were discussing our plans , and , being observed by our huge negro Zambo , who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all his race bear to the half-breeds , he was dragged out and carried into our presence . Gomez whipped out his knife , however , and but for the huge strength of his captor , which enabled him to disarm him with one hand , he would certainly have stabbed him . The matter has ended in reprimands , the opponents have been compelled to shake hands , and there is every hope that all will be well . As to the feuds of the two learned men , they are continuous and bitter . It must be admitted that Challenger is provocative in the last degree , but Summerlee has an acid tongue , which makes matters worse . Last night Challenger said that he never cared to walk on the Thames Embankment and look up the river , as it was always sad to see one 's own eventual goal . He is convinced , of course , that he is destined for Westminster Abbey . Summerlee rejoined , however , with a sour smile , by saying that he understood that Millbank Prison had been pulled down . Challenger 's conceit is too colossal to allow him to be really annoyed . He only smiled in his beard and repeated `` Really ! Really ! '' in the pitying tone one would use to a child . Indeed , they are children both -- the one wizened and cantankerous , the other formidable and overbearing , yet each with a brain which has put him in the front rank of his scientific age . Brain , character , soul -- only as one sees more of life does one understand how distinct is each . The very next day we did actually make our start upon this remarkable expedition . We found that all our possessions fitted very easily into the two canoes , and we divided our personnel , six in each , taking the obvious precaution in the interests of peace of putting one Professor into each canoe . Personally , I was with Challenger , who was in a beatific humor , moving about as one in a silent ecstasy and beaming benevolence from every feature . I have had some experience of him in other moods , however , and shall be the less surprised when the thunderstorms suddenly come up amidst the sunshine . If it is impossible to be at your ease , it is equally impossible to be dull in his company , for one is always in a state of half-tremulous doubt as to what sudden turn his formidable temper may take . For two days we made our way up a good-sized river some hundreds of yards broad , and dark in color , but transparent , so that one could usually see the bottom . The affluents of the Amazon are , half of them , of this nature , while the other half are whitish and opaque , the difference depending upon the class of country through which they have flowed . The dark indicate vegetable decay , while the others point to clayey soil . Twice we came across rapids , and in each case made a portage of half a mile or so to avoid them . The woods on either side were primeval , which are more easily penetrated than woods of the second growth , and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes through them . How shall I ever forget the solemn mystery of it ? The height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which I in my town-bred life could have imagined , shooting upwards in magnificent columns until , at an enormous distance above our heads , we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure , through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity . As we walked noiselessly amid the thick , soft carpet of decaying vegetation the hush fell upon our souls which comes upon us in the twilight of the Abbey , and even Professor Challenger's full-chested notes sank into a whisper . Alone , I should have been ignorant of the names of these giant growths , but our men of science pointed out the cedars , the great silk cotton trees , and the redwood trees , with all that profusion of various plants which has made this continent the chief supplier to the human race of those gifts of Nature which depend upon the vegetable world , while it is the most backward in those",The Lost World
Jane Austen,"All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness of the match , and her uncle , the lawyer , himself , allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it . She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation ; and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as Miss Maria , did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage . But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them . Miss Ward , at the end of half a dozen years , found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev . Mr. Norris , a friend of her brother-in-law , with scarcely any private fortune , and Miss Frances fared yet worse . Miss Ward ’ s match , indeed , when it came to the point , was not contemptible : Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield ; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a year . But Miss Frances married , in the common phrase , to disoblige her family , and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines , without education , fortune , or connexions , did it very thoroughly . She could hardly have made a more untoward choice . Sir Thomas Bertram had interest , which , from principle as well as pride—from a general wish of doing right , and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability , he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram ’ s sister ; but her husband ’ s profession was such as no interest could reach ; and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them , an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place . It was the natural result of the conduct of each party , and such as a very imprudent marriage almost always produces . To save herself from useless remonstrance , Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married . Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences . Mrs. Price , in her turn , was injured and angry ; and an answer , which comprehended each sister in its bitterness , and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself , put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period . Their homes were so distant , and the circles in which they moved so distinct , as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other ’ s existence during the eleven following years , or , at least , to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them , as she now and then did , in an angry voice , that Fanny had got another child . By the end of eleven years , however , Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment , or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her . A large and still increasing family , an husband disabled for active service , but not the less equal to company and good liquor , and a very small income to supply their wants , made her eager to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed ; and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence , such a superfluity of children , and such a want of almost everything else , as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation . She was preparing for her ninth lying-in ; and after bewailing the circumstance , and imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child , she could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance of the eight already in being . Her eldest was a boy of ten years old , a fine spirited fellow , who longed to be out in the world ; but what could she do ? Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property ? No situation would be beneath him ; or what did Sir Thomas think of Woolwich ? or how could a boy be sent out to the East ? The letter was not unproductive . It re-established peace and kindness . Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions , Lady Bertram dispatched money and baby-linen , and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters . Such were its immediate effects , and within a twelvemonth a more important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it . Mrs. Norris was often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of her head , and that , much as they had all done for her , she seemed to be wanting to do more ; and at length she could not but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number . “ What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter , a girl now nine years old , of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give ? The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing , compared with the benevolence of the action. ” Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly . “ I think we can not do better , ” said she ; “ let us send for the child. ” Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent . He debated and hesitated ; —it was a serious charge ; —a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for , or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking her from her family . He thought of his own four children , of his two sons , of cousins in love , etc . ; —but no sooner had he deliberately begun to state his objections , than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all , whether stated or not . “ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’ s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . Having no children of my own , who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow , but the children of my sisters ? —and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just—but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle . Give a girl an education , and introduce her properly into the world , and ten to one but she has the means of settling well , without farther expense to anybody . A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of _yours_ , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages . I don ’ t say she would be so handsome as her cousins . I dare say she would not ; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as , in all human probability , would get her a creditable establishment . You are thinking of your sons—but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , _that_ is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ? It is morally impossible . I never knew an instance of it . It is , in fact , the only sure way of providing against the connexion . Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief . The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect , would be enough to make either of the dear , sweet-tempered boys in love with her . But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister. ” “ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ” replied Sir Thomas , “ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting. ” “ I thoroughly understand you , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . Is not she a sister ’ s child ? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her ? My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing . So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; _you_ shall have no trouble about it . My own trouble , you know , I never regard . I will send Nanny to London on purpose , and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler ’ s , and the child be appointed to meet her there . They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach , under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going . I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman ’ s wife or other going up. ” Except to the attack on Nanny ’ s cousin , Sir Thomas no longer made any objection , and a more respectable , though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted , everything was considered as settled , and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed . The division of gratifying sensations ought not , in strict justice , to have been equal ; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child , and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance . As far as walking , talking , and contriving reached , she was thoroughly benevolent , and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others ; but her love of money was equal to her love of directing , and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends . Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to , she had , from the first , fancied a very strict line of economy necessary ; and what was begun as a matter of prudence , soon grew into a matter of choice , as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply . Had there been a family to provide for , Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money ; but having no care of that kind , there was nothing to impede her frugality , or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to . Under this infatuating principle , counteracted by no real affection for her sister , it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity ; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage , after this conversation , in the happy belief of being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world . When the subject was brought forward again , her views were more fully explained ; and , in reply to Lady Bertram ’ s calm inquiry of “ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ” Sir Thomas heard with some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris ’ s power to take any share in the personal charge of her . He had been considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage , as a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own ; but he found himself wholly mistaken . Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little girl ’ s staying with them , at least as things then were , was quite out of the question . Poor Mr. Norris ’ s indifferent state of health made it an impossibility : he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly ; if , indeed , he should ever get well of his gouty complaints , it would be a different matter : she should then be glad to take her turn , and think nothing of the inconvenience ; but just now , poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time , and the very mention of such a thing she was sure would distract him . “ Then she had better come to us , ” said Lady Bertram , with the utmost composure . After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity , “ Yes , let her home be in this house . We will endeavour to do our duty by her , and she will , at least , have the advantage of companions of her own age , and of a regular instructress. ” “ Very true , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two—there can be no difference . I only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power . I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days . I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries . It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others . Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else. ” Lady Bertram made no opposition . “ I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl , ” continued Mrs. Norris , “ and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends. ” “ Should her disposition be really bad , ” said Sir Thomas , “ we must not , for our own children ’ s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates . Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for _them_ , and everything to hope for _her_ , from the association. ” “ That is exactly what I think , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ and what I was saying to my husband this morning . It will be an education for the child , said I , only being with her cousins ; if Miss Lee taught her nothing , she would learn to be good and clever from _them_. ” “ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone. ” “ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ” observed Sir Thomas , “ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_ . I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals . Their rank , fortune , rights , and expectations will always be different . It is a point of great delicacy , and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct. ” Mrs. Norris was quite at his service ; and though she perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most difficult thing , encouraged him to hope that between them it would be easily managed . It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sister in vain . Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed on , when she had so many fine boys , but accepted the offer most thankfully , assuring them of her daughter ’ s being a very well-disposed , good-humoured girl , and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off . She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny , but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air . Poor woman ! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of her children . CHAPTER II The little girl performed her long journey in safety ; and at Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris , who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost to welcome her , and in the importance of leading her in to the others , and recommending her to their kindness . Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old , and though there might not be much in her first appearance to captivate , there was , at least , nothing to disgust her relations . She was small of her age , with no glow of complexion , nor any other striking beauty ; exceedingly timid and shy , and shrinking from notice ; but her air , though awkward , was not vulgar , her voice was sweet , and when she spoke her countenance was pretty . Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good-humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two . The young people were all at home , and sustained their share in the introduction very well , with much good humour , and no embarrassment , at least on the part of the sons , who , at seventeen and sixteen , and tall of their age , had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin . The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of their father , who addressed them on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity . But they were too much used to company and praise to have anything like natural shyness ; and their confidence increasing from their cousin ’ s total want of it , they were soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference . They were a remarkably fine family , the sons very well-looking , the daughters decidedly handsome , and all of them well-grown and forward of their age , which produced as striking a difference between the cousins in person , as education had given to their address ; and no one would have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were . There were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny . Julia Bertram was only twelve , and Maria but a year older . The little visitor meanwhile was as unhappy as possible . Afraid of everybody , ashamed of herself , and longing for the home she had left , she knew not how to look up , and could scarcely speak to be heard , or without crying . Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune , and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to produce , and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy . The fatigue , too , of so long a journey , became soon no trifling evil . In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed . “ This is not a very promising beginning , ” said Mrs. Norris , when Fanny had left the room . “ After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper—her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child—and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _was_ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things. ” It required a longer time , however , than Mrs. Norris was inclined to allow , to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park , and the separation from everybody she had been used to . Her feelings were very acute , and too little understood to be properly attended to . Nobody meant to be unkind , but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her comfort . The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day , on purpose to afford leisure for getting acquainted with , and entertaining their young cousin , produced little union . They could not but hold her cheap on finding that she had but two sashes , and had never learned French ; and when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so good as to play , they could do no more than make her a generous present of some of their least valued toys , and leave her to herself , while they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment , making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper . Fanny , whether near or from her cousins , whether in the schoolroom , the drawing-room , or the shrubbery , was equally forlorn , finding something to fear in every person and place . She was disheartened by Lady Bertram ’ s silence , awed by Sir Thomas ’ s grave looks , and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris ’ s admonitions . Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size , and abashed her by noticing her shyness : Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance , and the maid-servants sneered at her clothes ; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow , instructress , and nurse , the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe . The grandeur of the house astonished , but could not console her . The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day ’ s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep . A week had passed in this way , and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner , when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund , the youngest of the sons , sitting crying on the attic stairs . “ My dear little cousin , ” said he , with all the gentleness of an excellent nature , “ what can be the matter ? ” And sitting down by her , he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised , and persuade her to speak openly . Was she ill ? or was anybody angry with her ? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia ? or was she puzzled about anything in her lesson that he could explain ? Did she , in short , want anything he could possibly get her , or do for her ? For a long while no answer could be obtained beyond a “ no , no—not at all—no , thank you ” ; but he still persevered ; and no sooner had he begun to revert to her own home , than her increased sobs explained to him where the grievance lay . He tried to console her . “ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ” said he , “ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters. ” On pursuing the subject , he found that , dear as all these brothers and sisters generally were , there was one among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest . It was William whom she talked of most , and wanted most to see . William , the eldest , a year older than herself , her constant companion and friend ; her advocate with her mother ( of whom he was the darling ) in every distress . “ William did not like she should come away ; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed. ” “ But William will write to you , I dare say. ” “ Yes , he had promised he would , but he had told _her_ to write first. ” “ And when shall you do it ? ” She hung her head and answered hesitatingly , “ she did not know ; she had not any paper. ” “ If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . Would it make you happy to write to William ? ” “ Yes , very. ” “ Then let it be done now . Come with me into the breakfast-room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves. ” “ But , cousin , will it go to the post ? ” “ Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing. ” “ My uncle ! ” repeated Fanny , with a frightened look . “ Yes , when you have written the letter , I will take it to my father to frank. ” Fanny thought it a bold measure , but offered no further resistance ; and they went together into the breakfast-room , where Edmund prepared her paper , and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could himself have felt , and probably with somewhat more exactness . He continued with her the whole time of her writing , to assist her with his penknife or his orthography , as either were wanted ; and added to these attentions , which she felt very much , a kindness to her brother which delighted her beyond all the rest . He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin William , and sent him half a guinea under the seal . Fanny ’ s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing ; but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight , and her cousin began to find her an interesting object . He talked to her more , and , from all that she said , was convinced of her having an affectionate heart , and a strong desire of doing right ; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation , and great timidity . He had never knowingly given her pain , but he now felt that she required more positive kindness ; and with that view endeavoured , in the first place , to lessen her fears of them all , and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and Julia , and being as merry as possible . From this day Fanny grew more comfortable . She felt that she had a friend , and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else . The place became less strange , and the people less formidable ; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease to fear , she began at least to know their ways , and to catch the best manner of conforming to them . The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all , and not least of herself , necessarily wore away , and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle , nor did her aunt Norris ’ s voice make her start very much . To her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion . Though unworthy , from inferiority of age and strength , to be their constant associate , their pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful , especially when that third was of an obliging , yielding temper ; and they could not but own , when their aunt inquired into her faults , or their brother Edmund urged her claims to their kindness , that “ Fanny was good-natured enough. ” Edmund was uniformly kind himself ; and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten . He was just entering into life , full of spirits , and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest son , who feels born only for expense and enjoyment . His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights : he made her some very pretty presents , and laughed at her . As her appearance and spirits improved , Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them that , though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble . A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_ . Fanny could read , work , and write , but she had been taught nothing more ; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar , they thought her prodigiously stupid , and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing-room . “ Dear mama , only think , my cousin can not put the map of Europe together—or my cousin can not tell the principal rivers in Russia—or , she never heard of Asia Minor—or she does not know the difference between water-colours and crayons ! —How strange ! —Did you ever hear anything so stupid ? ” “ My dear , ” their considerate aunt would reply , “ it is very bad , but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself. ” “ But , aunt , she is really so very ignorant ! —Do you know , we asked her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland ; and she said , she should cross to the Isle of Wight . She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight , and she calls it _the_ _Island_ , as if there were no other island in the world . I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself , if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is . I can not remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet . How long ago it is , aunt , since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England , with the dates of their accession , and most of the principal events of their reigns ! ” “ Yes , ” added the other ; “ and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus ; besides a great deal of the heathen mythology , and all the metals , semi-metals , planets , and distinguished philosophers. ” “ Very true indeed , my dears , but you are blessed with wonderful memories , and your poor cousin has probably none at all . There is a vast deal of difference in memories , as well as in everything else , and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin , and pity her deficiency . And remember that , if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves , you should always be modest ; for , much as you know already , there is a great deal more for you to learn. ” “ Yes , I know there is , till I am seventeen . But I must tell you another thing of Fanny , so odd and so stupid . Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing. ” “ To be sure , my dear , that is very stupid indeed , and shows a great want of genius and emulation . But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are ; —on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference. ” Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces ’ minds ; and it is not very wonderful that , with all their promising talents and early information , they should be entirely deficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge , generosity and humility . In everything but disposition they were admirably taught . Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting , because , though a truly anxious father , he was not outwardly affectionate , and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him . To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest attention . She had not time for such cares . She was a woman who spent her days in sitting , nicely dressed , on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by Sir Thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister . Had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls , she would probably have supposed it unnecessary , for they were under the care of a governess , with proper masters , and could want nothing more . As for Fanny ’ s being stupid at learning , “ she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _were_ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted. ” Fanny , with all her faults of ignorance and timidity , was fixed at Mansfield Park , and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home , grew up there not unhappily among her cousins . There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia ; and though Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her , she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it . From about the time of her entering the family , Lady Bertram , in consequence of a little ill-health , and a great deal of indolence , gave up the house in town , which she had been used to occupy every spring , and remained wholly in the country , leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in Parliament , with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence . In the country , therefore , the Miss Bertrams continued to exercise their memories , practise their duets , and grow tall and womanly : and their father saw them becoming in person , manner , and accomplishments , everything that could satisfy his anxiety . His eldest son was careless and extravagant , and had already given him much uneasiness ; but his other children promised him nothing but good . His daughters , he felt , while they retained the name of Bertram , must be giving it new grace , and in quitting it , he trusted , would extend its respectable alliances ; and the character of Edmund , his strong good sense and uprightness of mind , bid most fairly for utility , honour , and happiness to himself and all his connexions . He was to be a clergyman . Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested , Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price : he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit ; and Fanny , though almost totally separated from her family , was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them , or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct . Once , and once only , in the course of many years , had she the happiness of being with William . Of the rest she saw nothing : nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again , even for a visit , nobody at home seemed to want her ; but William determining , soon after her removal , to be a sailor , was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea . Their eager affection in meeting , their exquisite delight in being together , their hours of happy mirth , and moments of serious conference , may be imagined ; as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last , and the misery of the girl when he left her . Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays , when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund ; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do , and be hereafter , in consequence of his profession , as made her gradually admit that the separation might have some use . Edmund ’ s friendship never failed her : his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind dispositions , and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them . Without any display of doing more than the rest , or any fear of doing too much , he was always true to her interests , and considerate of her feelings , trying to make her good qualities understood , and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent ; giving her advice , consolation , and encouragement . Kept back as she was by everybody else , his single support could not bring her forward ; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance in assisting the improvement of her mind , and extending its pleasures . He knew her to be clever , to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense , and a fondness for reading , which , properly directed , must be an education in itself . Miss Lee taught her French , and heard her read the daily portion of history ; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours , he encouraged her taste , and corrected her judgment : he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read , and heightened its attraction by judicious praise . In return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except William : her heart was divided between the two . CHAPTER III The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr. Norris , which happened when Fanny was about fifteen , and necessarily introduced alterations and novelties . Mrs. Norris , on quitting the Parsonage , removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas ’ s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders . But Tom ’ s extravagance had , previous to that event , been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary , and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder . There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas ’ s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do . “ I blush for you , Tom , ” said he , in his most dignified manner ; “ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts. ” Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris ’ s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty-five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram ’ s calculations . But “ no , he was a short-necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off. ” He had a wife about fifteen years his junior , but no children ; and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very respectable , agreeable people . The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris ’ s situation , and the improvement in Fanny ’ s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son ’ s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision . In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’ s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? ” Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt ’ s words , “ Going to leave you ? ” “ Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same. ” The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected . She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris , and could not love her . “ I shall be very sorry to go away , ” said she , with a faltering voice . “ Yes , I dare say you will ; _that ’ s_ natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world. ” “ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ” said Fanny modestly . “ No , my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl. ” “ And am I never to live here again ? ” “ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other. ” Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart ; she could not feel the difference to be so small , she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction . As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress . “ Cousin , ” said she , “ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris. ” “ Indeed ! ” “ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there. ” “ Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one. ” “ Oh , cousin ! ” “ It has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ” “ Indeed it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her. ” “ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _must_ be important to her. ” “ I can never be important to any one. ” “ What is to prevent you ? ” “ Everything . My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness. ” “ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion. ” “ You are too kind , ” said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; “ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life. ” “ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . _Here_ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _her_ you will be forced to speak for yourself. ” “ Oh ! do not say so. ” “ I must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers. ” Fanny sighed , and said , “ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . _Here_ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well. ” “ The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride. ” “ Very true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’ s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well. ” “ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too. ” So ended their discourse , which , for any very appropriate service it could render Fanny , might as well have been spared , for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her . It had never occurred to her , on the present occasion , but as a thing to be carefully avoided . To prevent its being expected , she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish , the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants , and allow a spare room for a friend , of which she made a very particular point . The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted , but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten . Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny . Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris— “ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you. ” Mrs. Norris almost started . “ Live with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? ” “ Is she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas. ” “ Me ! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? ” “ Indeed , I do not know . I suppose he thought it best. ” “ But what did he say ? He could not say he _wished_ me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it. ” “ No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here. ” “ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed—what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can. ” “ Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ” “ Lady Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I _have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I _must_ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year. ” “ I dare say you will . You always do , don ’ t you ? ” “ My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children ’ s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having. ” “ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that. ” “ Why , you know , Sir Thomas ’ s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns. ” “ Oh ! _that_ will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know. ” “ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend. ” Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law ’ s views ; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation , or the slightest allusion to it from him . He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her . Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House , the Grants arrived at the Parsonage , and these events over , everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual . The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable , gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance . They had their faults , and Mrs. Norris soon found them out . The Doctor was very fond of eating , and would have a good dinner every day ; and Mrs. Grant , instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense , gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park , and was scarcely ever seen in her offices . Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances , nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house . “ Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _her_ _time_ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . _Her_ store-room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds. ” Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective . She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant ’ s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies . Sir Thomas found it expedient to go to Antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home . They left England with the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent . The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light , and the hope of its utility to his son , reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family , and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life . He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris ’ s watchful attention , and in Edmund ’ s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct . Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves . The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion : not for their sorrow , but for their want of it . Their father was no object of love to them ; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures , and his absence was unhappily most welcome . They were relieved by it from all restraint ; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas , they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal , and to have every indulgence within their reach . Fanny ’ s relief , and her consciousness of it , were quite equal to her cousins ’ ; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful , and she really grieved because she could not grieve . “ Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility. ” He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ” while he said it , every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten . But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten. ” She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite . CHAPTER IV Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could be only nominally missed ; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to find how very well they did even without his father , how well Edmund could supply his place in carving , talking to the steward , writing to the attorney , settling with the servants , and equally saving her from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters . The earliest intelligence of the travellers ’ safe arrival at Antigua , after a favourable voyage , was received ; though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very dreadful fears , and trying to make Edmund participate them whenever she could get him alone ; and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe , she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others , when Sir Thomas ’ s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while . The winter came and passed without their being called for ; the accounts continued perfectly good ; and Mrs. Norris , in promoting gaieties for her nieces , assisting their toilets , displaying their accomplishments , and looking about for their future husbands , had so much to do as , in addition to all her own household cares , some interference in those of her sister , and Mrs. Grant ’ s wasteful doings to overlook , left her very little occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent . The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the neighbourhood ; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy , and carefully formed to general civility and obligingness , they possessed its favour as well as its admiration . Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it , and gave themselves no airs ; while the praises attending such behaviour , secured and brought round by their aunt , served to strengthen them in believing they had no faults . Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters . She was too indolent even to accept a mother ’ s gratification in witnessing their success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble , and the charge was made over to her sister , who desired nothing better than a post of such honourable representation , and very thoroughly relished the means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to hire . Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season ; but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt ’ s companion when they called away the rest of the family ; and , as Miss Lee had left Mansfield , she naturally became everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party . She talked to her , listened to her , read to her ; and the tranquillity of such evenings , her perfect security in such a _tête-à-tête_ from any sound of unkindness , was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments . As to her cousins ’ gaieties , she loved to hear an account of them , especially of the balls , and whom Edmund had danced with ; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same , and listened , therefore , without an idea of any nearer concern in them . Upon the whole , it was a comfortable winter to her ; for though it brought no William to England , the never-failing hope of his arrival was worth much . The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend , the old grey pony ; and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections ; for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horse-back , no measures were taken for mounting her again , “ because , ” as it was observed by her aunts , “ she might ride one of her cousin ’ s horses at any time when they did not want them , ” and as the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day , and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure , that time , of course , never came . They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May ; and Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt , or walked beyond her strength at the instigation of the other : Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself ; and Mrs. Norris , who was walking all day , thinking everybody ought to walk as much . Edmund was absent at this time , or the evil would have been earlier remedied . When he returned , to understand how Fanny was situated , and perceived its ill effects , there seemed with him but one thing to be done ; and that “ Fanny must have a horse ” was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother , or the economy of his aunt , to make it appear unimportant . Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that would do vastly well ; or that one might be borrowed of the steward ; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post . She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary , and even improper , that Fanny should have a regular lady ’ s horse of her own , in the style of her cousins . She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it : and she must say that , to be making such a purchase in his absence , and adding to the great expenses of his stable , at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled , seemed to her very unjustifiable . “ Fanny must have a horse , ” was Edmund ’ s only reply . Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light . Lady Bertram did : she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it , and as to its being considered necessary by his father ; she only pleaded against there being any hurry ; she only wanted him to wait till Sir Thomas ’ s return , and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself . He would be at home in September , and where would be the harm of only waiting till September ? Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother , as evincing least regard for her niece , he could not help paying more attention to what she said ; and at length determined on a method of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father ’ s thinking he had done too much , and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate means of exercise , which he could not bear she should be without . He had three horses of his own , but not one that would carry a woman . Two of them were hunters ; the third , a useful road-horse : this third he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride ; he knew where such a one was to be met with ; and having once made up his mind , the whole business was soon completed . The new mare proved a treasure ; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose , and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her . She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey pony ; but her delight in Edmund ’ s mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort ; and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung , was beyond all her words to express . She regarded her cousin as an example of everything good and great , as possessing worth which no one but herself could ever appreciate , and as entitled to such gratitude from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay . Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful , grateful , confiding , and tender . As the horse continued in name , as well as fact , the property of Edmund , Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny ’ s use ; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again , he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas ’ s return in September , for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad , and without any near prospect of finishing his business . Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England ; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his son , and waiting the final arrangement by himself . Tom arrived safely , bringing an excellent account of his father ’ s health ; but to very little purpose , as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned . Sir Thomas ’ s sending away his son seemed to her so like a parent ’ s care , under the influence of a foreboding of evil to himself , that she could not help feeling dreadful presentiments ; and as the long evenings of autumn came on , was so terribly haunted by these ideas , in the sad solitariness of her cottage , as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park . The return of winter engagements , however , was not without its effect ; and in the course of their progress , her mind became so pleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece , as tolerably to quiet her nerves . “ If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ” she very often thought ; always when they were in the company of men of fortune , and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country . Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram , and , being inclined to marry , soon fancied himself in love . He was a heavy young man , with not more than common sense ; but as there was nothing disagreeable in his figure or address , the young lady was well pleased with her conquest . Being now in her twenty-first year , Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty ; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father ’ s , as well as ensure her the house in town , which was now a prime object , it became , by the same rule of moral obligation , her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could . Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match , by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party ; and , among other means , by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman ’ s mother , who at present lived with him , and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit . It was not long before a good understanding took place between this lady and herself . Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry , and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen , Miss Bertram seemed , by her amiable qualities and accomplishments , the best adapted to make him happy . Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment , and admired the nice discernment of character which could so well distinguish merit . Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them all—perfectly faultless—an angel ; and , of course , so surrounded by admirers , must be difficult in her choice : but yet , as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance , Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her . After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls , the young people justified these opinions , and an engagement , with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas , was entered into , much to the satisfaction of their respective families , and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood , who had , for many weeks past , felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth ’ s marrying Miss Bertram . It was some months before Sir Thomas ’ s consent could be received ; but , in the meanwhile , as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion , the intercourse of the two families was carried on without restraint , and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris ’ s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present . Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business ; but no representation of his aunt ’ s could induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion . He could allow his sister to be the best judge of her own happiness , but he was not pleased that her happiness should centre in a large income ; nor could he refrain from often saying to himself , in Mr. Rushworth ’ s company— “ If this man had not twelve thousand a year , he would be a very stupid fellow. ” Sir Thomas , however , was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so unquestionably advantageous , and of which he heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable . It was a connexion exactly of the right sort—in the same county , and the same interest—and his most hearty concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible . He only conditioned that the marriage should not take place before his return , which he was again looking eagerly forward to . He wrote in April , and had strong hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction , and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer . Such was the state of affairs in the month of July ; and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year , when the society of the village received an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant , a Mr. and Miss Crawford , the children of her mother by a second marriage . They were young people of fortune . The son had a good estate in Norfolk , the daughter twenty thousand pounds . As children , their sister had been always very fond of them ; but , as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of their common parent , which left them to the care of a brother of their father , of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing , she had scarcely seen them since . In their uncle ’ s house they had found a kind home . Admiral and Mrs. Crawford , though agreeing in nothing else , were united in affection for these children , or , at least , were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite , to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two . The Admiral delighted in the boy , Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl ; and it was the lady ’ s death which now obliged her _protegee_ , after some months ’ further trial at her uncle ’ s house , to find another home . Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct , who chose , instead of retaining his niece , to bring his mistress under his own roof ; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister ’ s proposal of coming to her , a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other ; for Mrs. Grant , having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children—having more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture , and made a choice collection of plants and poultry—was very much in want of some variety at home . The arrival , therefore , of a sister whom she had always loved , and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single , was highly agreeable ; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London . Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions , though they arose principally from doubts of her sister ’ s style of living and tone of society ; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house , that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations . To anything like a permanence of abode , or limitation of society , Henry Crawford had , unluckily , a great dislike : he could not accommodate his sister in an article of such importance ; but he escorted her , with the utmost kindness , into Northamptonshire , and as readily engaged to fetch her away again , at half an hour ’ s notice , whenever she were weary of the place . The meeting was very satisfactory on each side . Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity , a sister ’ s husband who looked the gentleman , and a house commodious and well fitted up ; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance . Mary Crawford was remarkably pretty ; Henry , though not handsome , had air and countenance ; the manners of both were lively and pleasant , and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them credit for everything else . She was delighted with each , but Mary was her dearest object ; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own , she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister ’ s . She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her : she had fixed on Tom Bertram ; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds , with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her ; and being a warm-hearted , unreserved woman , Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned . Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them , and not at all displeased either at her sister ’ s early care , or the choice it had fallen on . Matrimony was her object , provided she could marry well : and having seen Mr. Bertram in town , she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life . While she treated it as a joke , therefore , she did not forget to think of it seriously . The scheme was soon repeated to Henry . “ And now , ” added Mrs. Grant , “ I have thought of something to make it complete . I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good-humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy. ” Henry bowed and thanked her . “ My dear sister , ” said Mary , “ if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of . If you can persuade Henry to marry , you must have the address of a Frenchwoman . All that English abilities can do has been tried already . I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry. ” “ My dear brother , I will not believe this of you. ” “ No , I am sure you are too good . You will be kinder than Mary . You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience . I am of a cautious temper , and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry . Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself . I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet— ‘ Heaven ’ s _last_ best gift. ’ ” “ There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile . I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’ s lessons have quite spoiled him. ” “ I pay very little regard , ” said Mrs. Grant , “ to what any young person says on the subject of marriage . If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person. ” Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no disinclination to the state herself . “ Oh yes ! I am not at all ashamed of it . I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly : I do not like to have people throw themselves away ; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage. ” CHAPTER V The young people were pleased with each other from the first . On each side there was much to attract , and their acquaintance soon promised as early an intimacy as good manners would warrant . Miss Crawford ’ s beauty did her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams . They were too handsome themselves to dislike any woman for being so too , and were almost as much charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye , clear brown complexion , and general prettiness . Had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country . Her brother was not handsome : no , when they first saw him he was absolutely plain , black and plain ; but still he was the gentleman , with a pleasing address . The second meeting proved him not so very plain : he was plain , to be sure , but then he had so much countenance , and his teeth were so good , and he was so well made , that one soon forgot he was plain ; and after a third interview , after dining in company with him at the Parsonage , he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody . He was , in fact , the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known , and they were equally delighted with him . Miss Bertram ’ s engagement made him in equity the property of Julia , of which Julia was fully aware ; and before he had been at Mansfield a week , she was quite ready to be fallen in love with . Maria ’ s notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct . She did not want to see or understand . “ There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man—everybody knew her situation—Mr . Crawford must take care of himself. ” Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger ! the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing , and were ready to be pleased ; and he began with no object but of making them like him . He did not want them to die of love ; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge and feel better , he allowed himself great latitude on such points . “ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; “ they are very elegant , agreeable girls. ” “ So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . But you like Julia best. ” “ Oh yes ! I like Julia best. ” “ But do you really ? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest. ” “ So I should suppose . She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me. ” “ I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _will_ like her best at last. ” “ Do not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_ ? ” “ And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . Remember that , my dear brother . Her choice is made. ” “ Yes , and I like her the better for it . An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged . She is satisfied with herself . Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion . All is safe with a lady engaged : no harm can be done. ” “ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her. ” “ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _that_ is your opinion of your intimate friend . _I_ do not subscribe to it . I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart. ” “ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ” “ We must leave him to himself , I believe . Talking does no good . He will be taken in at last. ” “ But I would not have him _taken_ _in_ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable. ” “ Oh dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in . It will do just as well . Everybody is taken in at some period or other. ” “ Not always in marriage , dear Mary. ” “ In marriage especially . With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry . Look where I will , I see that it _is_ so ; and I feel that it _must_ be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves. ” “ Ah ! You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street. ” “ My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business . I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . What is this but a take in ? ” “ My dear child , there must be a little imagination here . I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you . Depend upon it , you see but half . You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation . There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere , and we are all apt to expect too much ; but then , if one scheme of happiness fails , human nature turns to another ; if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better : we find comfort somewhere—and those evil-minded observers , dearest Mary , who make much of a little , are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves. ” “ Well done , sister ! I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_ . When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too . It would save me many a heartache. ” “ You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both . Mansfield shall cure you both , and without any taking in . Stay with us , and we will cure you. ” The Crawfords , without wanting to be cured , were very willing to stay . Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home , and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit . He had come , intending to spend only a few days with them ; but Mansfield promised well , and there was nothing to call him elsewhere . It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay-at-home man ; and Mr. Crawford ’ s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day . The Miss Bertrams ’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford ’ s habits made her likely to feel . She acknowledged , however , that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men , that two such young men were not often seen together even in London , and that their manners , particularly those of the eldest , were very good . _He_ had been much in London , and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund , and must , therefore , be preferred ; and , indeed , his being the eldest was another strong claim . She had felt an early presentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best . She knew it was her way . Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant , indeed , at any rate ; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked , his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp , for he had easy manners , excellent spirits , a large acquaintance , and a great deal to say ; and the reversion of Mansfield Park , and a baronetcy , did no harm to all this . Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do . She looked about her with due consideration , and found almost everything in his favour : a park , a real park , five miles round , a spacious modern-built house , so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen ’ s seats in the kingdom , and wanting only to be completely new furnished—pleasant sisters , a quiet mother , and an agreeable man himself—with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father , and of being Sir Thomas hereafter . It might do very well ; she believed she should accept him ; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B—— races . These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began ; and as it appeared that the family did not , from his usual goings on , expect him back again for many weeks , it would bring his passion to an early proof . Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races , and schemes were made for a large party to them , with all the eagerness of inclination , but it would only do to be talked of . And Fanny , what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while ? and what was _her_ opinion of the newcomers ? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny . In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford ’ s beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _him_ . The notice , which she excited herself , was to this effect . “ I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams . “ Pray , is she out , or is she not ? I am puzzled . She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _out_ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _is_. ” Edmund , to whom this was chiefly addressed , replied , “ I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question . My cousin is grown up . She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me. ” “ And yet , in general , nothing can be more easily ascertained . The distinction is so broad . Manners as well as appearance are , generally speaking , so totally different . Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl ’ s being out or not . A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite—to confidence ! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system . One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing—and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before . Mr. Bertram , I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such changes. ” “ I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at . You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson. ” “ No , indeed . Miss Anderson ! I do not know who or what you mean . I am quite in the dark . But I _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about. ” “ Ah ! you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed on . You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady . You paint too accurately for mistake . It was exactly so . The Andersons of Baker Street . We were speaking of them the other day , you know . Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson . The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it . When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _out_ , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady—nothing like a civil answer—she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth . She was then _out_ . I met her at Mrs. Holford ’ s , and did not recollect her . She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story. ” “ And a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson . It is too common a fault . Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters . I do not know where the error lies . I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong. ” “ Those who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be , ” said Mr. Bertram gallantly , “ are doing a great deal to set them right. ” “ The error is plain enough , ” said the less courteous Edmund ; “ such girls are ill brought up . They are given wrong notions from the beginning . They are always acting upon motives of vanity , and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public than afterwards. ” “ I do not know , ” replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly . “ Yes , I can not agree with you there . It is certainly the modestest part of the business . It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done . That is worse than anything—quite disgusting ! ” “ Yes , _that_ is very inconvenient indeed , ” said Mr. Bertram . “ It leads one astray ; one does not know what to do . The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them . I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies . My friend Sneyd—you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund—his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . When we reached Albion Place they were out ; we went after them , and found them on the pier : Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds , with others of their acquaintance . I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well-dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _out_ , and had most excessively offended the eldest . Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me. ” “ That was bad indeed . Poor Miss Sneyd . Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . To be neglected before one ’ s time must be very vexatious ; but it was entirely the mother ’ s fault . Miss Augusta should have been with her governess . Such half-and-half doings never prosper . But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . Does she go to balls ? Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’ s ? ” “ No , ” replied Edmund ; “ I do not think she has ever been to a ball . My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _her_. ” “ Oh ! then the point is clear . Miss Price is not out. ” CHAPTER VI Mr. Bertram set off for———— , and Miss Crawford was prepared to find a great chasm in their society , and to miss him decidedly in the meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families ; and on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going , she retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table , fully expecting to feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters . It would be a very flat business , she was sure . In comparison with his brother , Edmund would have nothing to say . The soup would be sent round in a most spiritless manner , wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling , and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any former haunch , or a single entertaining story , about “ my friend such a one. ” She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end of the table , and in observing Mr. Rushworth , who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords ’ arrival . He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county , and that friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver , Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject , and very eager to be improving his own place in the same way ; and though not saying much to the purpose , could talk of nothing else . The subject had been already handled in the drawing-room ; it was revived in the dining-parlour . Miss Bertram ’ s attention and opinion was evidently his chief aim ; and though her deportment showed rather conscious superiority than any solicitude to oblige him , the mention of Sotherton Court , and the ideas attached to it , gave her a feeling of complacency , which prevented her from being very ungracious . “ I wish you could see Compton , ” said he ; “ it is the most complete thing ! I never saw a place so altered in my life . I told Smith I did not know where I was . The approach _now_ , is one of the finest things in the country : you see the house in the most surprising manner . I declare , when I got back to Sotherton yesterday , it looked like a prison—quite a dismal old prison. ” “ Oh , for shame ! ” cried Mrs. Norris . “ A prison indeed ? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world. ” “ It wants improvement , ma ’ am , beyond anything . I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life ; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it. ” “ No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , ” said Mrs. Grant to Mrs. Norris , with a smile ; “ but depend upon it , Sotherton will have _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire. ” “ I must try to do something with it , ” said Mr. Rushworth , “ but I do not know what . I hope I shall have some good friend to help me. ” “ Your best friend upon such an occasion , ” said Miss Bertram calmly , “ would be Mr. Repton , I imagine. ” “ That is what I was thinking of . As he has done so well by Smith , I think I had better have him at once . His terms are five guineas a day. ” “ Well , and if they were _ten_ , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ I am sure _you_ need not regard it . The expense need not be any impediment . If I were you , I should not think of the expense . I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible . Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris ’ s sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _that_ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for _that_ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . We were always doing something as it was . It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris ’ s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , ” addressing herself then to Dr. Grant . “ The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , ” replied Dr. Grant . “ The soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering. ” “ Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us—that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill—and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park. ” “ You were imposed on , ma ’ am , ” replied Dr. Grant : “ these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are. ” “ The truth is , ma ’ am , ” said Mrs. Grant , pretending to whisper across the table to Mrs. Norris , “ that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all. ” Mrs. Norris , who had begun to redden , was appeased ; and , for a little while , other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton . Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends ; their acquaintance had begun in dilapidations , and their habits were totally dissimilar . After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again . “ Smith ’ s place is the admiration of all the country ; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand . I think I shall have Repton. ” “ Mr . Rushworth , ” said Lady Bertram , “ if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather. ” Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence , and tried to make out something complimentary ; but , between his submission to _her_ taste , and his having always intended the same himself , with the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in general , and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to please , he grew puzzled , and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine . Mr. Rushworth , however , though not usually a great talker , had still more to say on the subject next his heart . “ Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds , which is little enough , and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved . Now , at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred , without reckoning the water meadows ; so that I think , if so much could be done at Compton , we need not despair . There have been two or three fine old trees cut down , that grew too near the house , and it opens the prospect amazingly , which makes me think that Repton , or anybody of that sort , would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down : the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill , you know , ” turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke . But Miss Bertram thought it most becoming to reply— “ The avenue ! Oh ! I do not recollect it . I really know very little of Sotherton. ” Fanny , who was sitting on the other side of Edmund , exactly opposite Miss Crawford , and who had been attentively listening , now looked at him , and said in a low voice— “ Cut down an avenue ! What a pity ! Does it not make you think of Cowper ? ‘ Ye fallen avenues , once more I mourn your fate unmerited. ’ ” He smiled as he answered , “ I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance , Fanny. ” “ I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down , to see the place as it is now , in its old state ; but I do not suppose I shall. ” “ Have you never been there ? No , you never can ; and , unluckily , it is out of distance for a ride . I wish we could contrive it. ” “ Oh ! it does not signify . Whenever I do see it , you will tell me how it has been altered. ” “ I collect , ” said Miss Crawford , “ that Sotherton is an old place , and a place of some grandeur . In any particular style of building ? ” “ The house was built in Elizabeth ’ s time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms . It is ill placed . It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement . But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of . Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well. ” Miss Crawford listened with submission , and said to herself , “ He is a well-bred man ; he makes the best of it. ” “ I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth , ” he continued ; “ but , had I a place to new fashion , I should not put myself into the hands of an improver . I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty , of my own choice , and acquired progressively . I would rather abide by my own blunders than by his. ” “ _You_ would know what you were about , of course ; but that would not suit _me_ . I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters , but as they are before me ; and had I a place of my own in the country , I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and I should never look at it till it was complete. ” “ It would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all , ” said Fanny . “ Ay , you have been brought up to it . It was no part of my education ; and the only dose I ever had , being administered by not the first favourite in the world , has made me consider improvements _in_ _hand_ as the greatest of nuisances . Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use . I would have everything as complete as possible in the country , shrubberies and flower-gardens , and rustic seats innumerable : but it must all be done without my care . Henry is different ; he loves to be doing. ” Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford , whom he was much disposed to admire , speak so freely of her uncle . It did not suit his sense of propriety , and he was silenced , till induced by further smiles and liveliness to put the matter by for the present . “ Mr . Bertram , ” said she , “ I have tidings of my harp at last . I am assured that it is safe at Northampton ; and there it has probably been these ten days , in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary. ” Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise . “ The truth is , that our inquiries were too direct ; we sent a servant , we went ourselves : this will not do seventy miles from London ; but this morning we heard of it in the right way . It was seen by some farmer , and he told the miller , and the miller told the butcher , and the butcher ’ s son-in-law left word at the shop. ” “ I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay. ” “ I am to have it to-morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? Not by a wagon or cart : oh no ! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow. ” “ You would find it difficult , I dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? ” “ I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing-closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all . Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish ! As for Dr. Grant ’ s bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of _his_ way ; and my brother-in-law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at. ” “ You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before ; but when you _do_ think of it , you must see the importance of getting in the grass . The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse. ” “ I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . However , I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow . Henry , who is good-nature itself , has offered to fetch it in his barouche . Will it not be honourably conveyed ? ” Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument , and hoped to be soon allowed to hear her . Fanny had never heard the harp at all , and wished for it very much . “ I shall be most happy to play to you both , ” said Miss Crawford ; “ at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . Now , Mr. Bertram , if you write to your brother , I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come : he heard so much of my misery about it . And you may say , if you please , that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return , in compassion to his feelings , as I know his horse will lose. ” “ If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing. ” “ No , I dare say , nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth , would you ever write to him , nor he to you , if it could be helped . The occasion would never be foreseen . What strange creatures brothers are ! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world ; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill , or such a relation dead , it is done in the fewest possible words . You have but one style among you . I know it perfectly . Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than— ‘ Dear Mary , I am just arrived . Bath seems full , and everything as usual . Yours sincerely. ’ That is the true manly style ; that is a complete brother ’ s letter. ” “ When they are at a distance from all their family , ” said Fanny , colouring for William ’ s sake , “ they can write long letters. ” “ Miss Price has a brother at sea , ” said Edmund , “ whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us. ” “ At sea , has she ? In the king ’ s service , of course ? ” Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story , but his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother ’ s situation : her voice was animated in speaking of his profession , and the foreign stations he had been on ; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been absent without tears in her eyes . Miss Crawford civilly wished him an early promotion . “ Do you know anything of my cousin ’ s captain ? ” said Edmund ; “ Captain Marshall ? You have a large acquaintance in the navy , I conclude ? ” “ Among admirals , large enough ; but , ” with an air of grandeur , “ we know very little of the inferior ranks . Post-captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to _us_ . Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies . But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . Certainly , my home at my uncle ’ s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of _Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough . Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat. ” Edmund again felt grave , and only replied , “ It is a noble profession. ” “ Yes , the profession is well enough under two circumstances : if it make the fortune , and there be discretion in spending it ; but , in short , it is not a favourite profession of mine . It has never worn an amiable form to _me_. ” Edmund reverted to the harp , and was again very happy in the prospect of hearing her play . The subject of improving grounds , meanwhile , was still under consideration among the others ; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing her brother , though it was calling his attention from Miss Julia Bertram . “ My dear Henry , have _you_ nothing to say ? You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . Everingham , as it _used_ to be , was perfect in my estimation : such a happy fall of ground , and such timber ! What would I not give to see it again ! ” “ Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it , ” was his answer ; “ but I fear there would be some disappointment : you would not find it equal to your present ideas . In extent , it is a mere nothing ; you would be surprised at its insignificance ; and , as for improvement , there was very little for me to do—too little : I should like to have been busy much longer. ” “ You are fond of the sort of thing ? ” said Julia . “ Excessively ; but what with the natural advantages of the ground , which pointed out , even to a very young eye , what little remained to be done , and my own consequent resolutions , I had not been of age three months before Everingham was all that it is now . My plan was laid at Westminster , a little altered , perhaps , at Cambridge , and at one-and-twenty executed . I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him . I have been a devourer of my own. ” “ Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , ” said Julia . “ _You_ can never want employment . Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion. ” Mrs. Grant , hearing the latter part of this speech , enforced it warmly , persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother ’ s ; and as Miss Bertram caught at the idea likewise , and gave it her full support , declaring that , in her opinion , it was infinitely better to consult with friends and disinterested advisers , than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a professional man , Mr. Rushworth was very ready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford ’ s assistance ; and Mr. Crawford , after properly depreciating his own abilities , was quite at his service in any way that could be useful . Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr. Crawford ’ s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton , and taking a bed there ; when Mrs. Norris , as if reading in her two nieces ’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away , interposed with an amendment . “ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’ s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? Why should not we make a little party ? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’ s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight . I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you. ” Lady Bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting Edmund , who heard it all and said nothing . CHAPTER VII “ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_ ? ” said Edmund the next day , after thinking some time on the subject himself . “ How did you like her yesterday ? ” “ Very well—very much . I like to hear her talk . She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her. ” “ It is her countenance that is so attractive . She has a wonderful play of feature ! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ” “ Oh yes ! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did . I was quite astonished . An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . I could not have believed it ! ” “ I thought you would be struck . It was very wrong ; very indecorous. ” “ And very ungrateful , I think. ” “ Ungrateful is a strong word . I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _gratitude_ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’ s memory which misleads her here . She is awkwardly circumstanced . With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral . I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’ s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . I do not censure her _opinions_ ; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in making them public. ” “ Do not you think , ” said Fanny , after a little consideration , “ that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral. ” “ That is a fair remark . Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under . But I think her present home must do her good . Mrs. Grant ’ s manners are just what they ought to be . She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection. ” “ Yes , except as to his writing her such short letters . She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good-nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . I am sure William would never have used _me_ so , under any circumstances . And what right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ” “ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill-humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . There she can not be justified . I am glad you saw it all as I did. ” Having formed her mind and gained her affections , he had a good chance of her thinking like him ; though at this period , and on this subject , there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity , for he was in a line of admiration of Miss Crawford , which might lead him where Fanny could not follow . Miss Crawford ’ s attractions did not lessen . The harp arrived , and rather added to her beauty , wit , and good-humour ; for she played with the greatest obligingness , with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming , and there was something clever to be said at the close of every air . Edmund was at the Parsonage every day , to be indulged with his favourite instrument : one morning secured an invitation for the next ; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener , and every thing was soon in a fair train . A young woman , pretty , lively , with a harp as elegant as herself , and both placed near a window , cut down to the ground , and opening on a little lawn , surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer , was enough to catch any man ’ s heart . The season , the scene , the air , were all favourable to tenderness and sentiment . Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use : it was all in harmony ; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set going , even the sandwich tray , and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it , were worth looking at . Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her . She felt it to be so , though she had not foreseen , and could hardly understand it ; for he was not pleasant by any common rule : he talked no nonsense ; he paid no compliments ; his opinions were unbending , his attentions tranquil and simple . There was a charm , perhaps , in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself . She did not think very much about it , however : he pleased her for the present ; she liked to have him near her ; it was enough . Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not . She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed , and of which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company ; but so it was . Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill-nature . The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’ s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish . No pain , no injury , however , was designed by him to his cousin in this offer : _she_ was not to lose a day ’ s exercise by it . The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin ; and Fanny , on its being first proposed , so far from feeling slighted , was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it . Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself , and no inconvenience to Fanny . Edmund , who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole , returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward . The second day ’ s trial was not so guiltless . Miss Crawford ’ s enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to leave off . Active and fearless , and though rather small , strongly made , she seemed formed for a horsewoman ; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in Edmund ’ s attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount . Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared . To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out . The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant ’ s meadow she immediately saw the group—Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse-back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on . A happy party it appeared to her , all interested in one object : cheerful beyond a doubt , for the sound of merriment ascended even to her . It was a sound which did not make _her_ cheerful ; she wondered that Edmund should forget her , and felt a pang . She could not turn her eyes from the meadow ; she could not help watching all that passed . At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field , which was not small , at a foot ’ s pace ; then , at _her_ apparent suggestion , they rose into a canter ; and to Fanny ’ s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat . After a few minutes they stopped entirely . Edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach . She must not wonder at all this ; what could be more natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful , and proving his good-nature by any one ? She could not but think , indeed , that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble ; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself ; but Mr. Crawford , with all his boasted good-nature , and all his coachmanship , probably knew nothing of the matter , and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund . She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty ; if she were forgotten , the poor mare should be remembered . Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse , and Miss Crawford still on horseback , but attended by Edmund on foot , pass through a gate into the lane , and so into the park , and make towards the spot where she stood . She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient ; and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion . “ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself—I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure. ” Fanny ’ s answer was extremely civil , and Edmund added his conviction that she could be in no hurry . “ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ” said he , “ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . I wish _you_ may not be fatigued by so much exercise . I wish you had saved yourself this walk home. ” “ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ” said she , as she sprang down with his help ; “ I am very strong . Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal. ” The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford ’ s great cleverness as a horse-woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own . “ It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding ! ” said he . “ I never see one sit a horse better . She did not seem to have a thought of fear . Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter . Lord bless you ! how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ” In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated . Her merit in being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams ; her delight in riding was like their own ; her early excellence in it was like their own , and they had great pleasure in praising it . “ I was sure she would ride well , ” said Julia ; “ she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’ s. ” “ Yes , ” added Maria , “ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind. ” When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day . “ No , I do not know—not if you want the mare , ” was her answer . “ I do not want her at all for myself , ” said he ; “ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time—for a whole morning , in short . She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . But any morning will do for this . She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . It would be very wrong if she did . _She_ rides only for pleasure ; _you_ for health. ” “ I shall not ride to-morrow , certainly , ” said Fanny ; “ I have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . You know I am strong enough now to walk very well. ” Edmund looked pleased , which must be Fanny ’ s comfort , and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning : the party included all the young people but herself , and was much enjoyed at the time , and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion . A successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another ; and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after . There were many other views to be shewn ; and though the weather was hot , there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go . A young party is always provided with a shady lane . Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner , in shewing the Crawfords the country , and doing the honours of its finest spots . Everything answered ; it was all gaiety and good-humour , the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure—till the fourth day , when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded . Miss Bertram was the one . Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _she_ was excluded . It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good-humour , on Mr. Rushworth ’ s account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home . As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert . Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half-asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’ s ill-humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more . For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars , to think beyond themselves ; but when the first pause came , Edmund , looking around , said , “ But where is Fanny ? Is she gone to bed ? ” “ No , not that I know of , ” replied Mrs. Norris ; “ she was here a moment ago. ” Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room , which was a very long one , told them that she was on the sofa . Mrs. Norris began scolding . “ That is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa . Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _we_ do ? If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . There is all the new calico , that was bought last week , not touched yet . I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa. ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good-humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma ’ am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house. ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache. ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well . How long have you had it ? ” “ Since a little before dinner . It is nothing but the heat. ” “ Did you go out in the heat ? ” “ Go out ! to be sure she did , ” said Mrs. Norris : “ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? Were not we _all_ out ? Even your mother was out to-day for above an hour. ” “ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ” added her ladyship , who had been thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris ’ s sharp reprimand to Fanny ; “ I was out above an hour . I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again. ” “ Fanny has been cutting roses , has she ? ” “ Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year . Poor thing ! _She_ found it hot enough ; but they were so full-blown that one could not wait. ” “ There was no help for it , certainly , ” rejoined Mrs. Norris , in a rather softened voice ; “ but I question whether her headache might not be caught _then_ , sister . There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow . Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled. ” “ She has got it , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time. ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma ’ am ? No wonder her head aches. ” Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia , and did not hear . “ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home. ” “ But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ” “ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again. ” Edmund got up and walked about the room , saying , “ And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ? Upon my word , ma ’ am , it has been a very ill-managed business. ” “ I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ” cried Mrs. Norris , unable to be longer deaf ; “ unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’ s dairymaid , by _her_ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny ’ s just stepping down to my house for me—it is not much above a quarter of a mile—I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? ” “ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma ’ am. ” “ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot . Between ourselves , Edmund , ” nodding significantly at his mother , “ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower-garden , that did the mischief. ” “ I am afraid it was , indeed , ” said the more candid Lady Bertram , who had overheard her ; “ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . It was as much as I could bear myself . Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower-beds , was almost too much for me. ” Edmund said no more to either lady ; but going quietly to another table , on which the supper-tray yet remained , brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny , and obliged her to drink the greater part . She wished to be able to decline it ; but the tears , which a variety of feelings created , made it easier to swallow than to speak . Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt , he was still more angry with himself . His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they had done . Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly considered ; but she had been left four days together without any choice of companions or exercise , and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require . He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford ’ s , that it should never happen again . Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park . The state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition ; for she had been feeling neglected , and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past . As she leant on the sofa , to which she had retreated that she might not be seen , the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head ; and the sudden change which Edmund ’ s kindness had then occasioned , made her hardly know how to support herself . CHAPTER VIII Fanny ’ s rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh-feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant . Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well pleased with its revival , and an early day was named and agreed to , provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged : the young ladies did not forget that stipulation , and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so , they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk ; and at last , on a hint from Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to the Parsonage directly , and call on Mr. Crawford , and inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not . Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in . Having been out some time , and taken a different route to the house , they had not met him . Comfortable hopes , however , were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home . The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course . It was hardly possible , indeed , that anything else should be talked of , for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it ; and Mrs. Rushworth , a well-meaning , civil , prosing , pompous woman , who thought nothing of consequence , but as it related to her own and her son ’ s concerns , had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party . Lady Bertram constantly declined it ; but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come , till Mrs. Norris ’ s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth . “ The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a _wish_ to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know. ” Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram ’ s staying at home , could only be sorry . “ The loss of her ladyship ’ s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place. ” “ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ” cried Mrs. Norris ; “ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her. ” “ Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny. ” Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful ; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday , to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage , and walk half-way down the park with the two other ladies . On his return to the breakfast-room , he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford ’ s being of the party were desirable or not , or whether her brother ’ s barouche would not be full without her . The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea , assuring her that the barouche would hold four perfectly well , independent of the box , on which _one_ might go with him . “ But why is it necessary , ” said Edmund , “ that Crawford ’ s carriage , or his _only_ , should be employed ? Why is no use to be made of my mother ’ s chaise ? I could not , when the scheme was first mentioned the other day , understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family. ” “ What ! ” cried Julia : “ go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do. ” “ Besides , ” said Maria , “ I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise. ” “ And , my dear Edmund , ” added Mrs. Norris , “ taking out _two_ carriages when _one_ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between",Mansfield Park
Mark Twain,"it was a law that was often broken . All of a sudden , on a murky night , a light would hop up , right under our bows , almost , and an agonized voice , with the backwoods 'whang ' to it , would wail out -- 'Whar ' n the -- -- you goin ' to ! Cai n't you see nothin ' , you dash-dashed aig-suckin ' , sheep-stealin ' , one-eyed son of a stuffed monkey ! ' Then for an instant , as we whistled by , the red glare from our furnaces would reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating orator as if under a lightning-flash , and in that instant our firemen and deck-hands would send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity , one of our wheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a steering-oar , and down the dead blackness would shut again . And that flatboatman would be sure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat , swearing stoutly that he had a light burning all the time , when in truth his gang had the lantern down below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by , and no watch on deck . Once , at night , in one of those forest-bordered crevices ( behind an island ) which steamboatmen intensely describe with the phrase 'as dark as the inside of a cow , ' we should have eaten up a Posey County family , fruit , furniture , and all , but that they happened to be fiddling down below , and we just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer off , doing no serious damage , unfortunately , but coming so near it that we had good hopes for a moment . These people brought up their lantern , then , of course ; and as we backed and filled to get away , the precious family stood in the light of it -- both sexes and various ages -- and cursed us till everything turned blue . Once a coalboatman sent a bullet through our pilot-house , when we borrowed a steering oar of him in a very narrow place . CHAPTER 11 The River Rises DURING this big rise these small-fry craft were an intolerable nuisance . We were running chute after chute , -- a new world to me , -- and if there was a particularly cramped place in a chute , we would be pretty sure to meet a broad-horn there ; and if he failed to be there , we would find him in a still worse locality , namely , the head of the chute , on the shoal water . And then there would be no end of profane cordialities exchanged . Sometimes , in the big river , when we would be feeling our way cautiously along through a fog , the deep hush would suddenly be broken by yells and a clamor of tin pans , and all in instant a log raft would appear vaguely through the webby veil , close upon us ; and then we did not wait to swap knives , but snatched our engine bells out by the roots and piled on all the steam we had , to scramble out of the way ! One does n't hit a rock or a solid log craft with a steamboat when he can get excused . You will hardly believe it , but many steamboat clerks always carried a large assortment of religious tracts with them in those old departed steamboating days . Indeed they did . Twenty times a day we would be cramping up around a bar , while a string of these small-fry rascals were drifting down into the head of the bend away above and beyond us a couple of miles . Now a skiff would dart away from one of them , and come fighting its laborious way across the desert of water . It would 'ease all , ' in the shadow of our forecastle , and the panting oarsmen would shout , ' Gim me a pa-a-per ! ' as the skiff drifted swiftly astern . The clerk would throw over a file of New Orleans journals . If these were picked up without comment , you might notice that now a dozen other skiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying anything . You understand , they had been waiting to see how No . 1 was going to fare . No . 1 making no comment , all the rest would bend to their oars and come on , now ; and as fast as they came the clerk would heave over neat bundles of religious tracts , tied to shingles . The amount of hard swearing which twelve packages of religious literature will command when impartially divided up among twelve raftsmen 's crews , who have pulled a heavy skiff two miles on a hot day to get them , is simply incredible . As I have said , the big rise brought a new world under my vision . By the time the river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths and were hourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out of water before ; we were shaving stumpy shores , like that at the foot of Madrid Bend , which I had always seen avoided before ; we were clattering through chutes like that of 82 , where the opening at the foot was an unbroken wall of timber till our nose was almost at the very spot . Some of these chutes were utter solitudes . The dense , untouched forest overhung both banks of the crooked little crack , and one could believe that human creatures had never intruded there before . The swinging grape-vines , the grassy nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by , the flowering creepers waving their red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks , and all the spendthrift richness of the forest foliage , were wasted and thrown away there . The chutes were lovely places to steer in ; they were deep , except at the head ; the current was gentle ; under the 'points ' the water was absolutely dead , and the invisible banks so bluff that where the tender willow thickets projected you could bury your boat 's broadside in them as you tore along , and then you seemed fairly to fly . Behind other islands we found wretched little farms , and wretcheder little log-cabins ; there were crazy rail fences sticking a foot or two above the water , with one or two jeans-clad , chills-racked , yellow-faced male miserables roosting on the top-rail , elbows on knees , jaws in hands , grinding tobacco and discharging the result at floating chips through crevices left by lost teeth ; while the rest of the family and the few farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding at her moorings close at hand . In this flat-boat the family would have to cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of days ( or possibly weeks ) , until the river should fall two or three feet and let them get back to their log-cabin and their chills again -- chills being a merciful provision of an all-wise Providence to enable them to take exercise without exertion . And this sort of watery camping out was a thing which these people were rather liable to be treated to a couple of times a year : by the December rise out of the Ohio , and the June rise out of the Mississippi . And yet these were kindly dispensations , for they at least enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and then , and look upon life when a steamboat went by . They appreciated the blessing , too , for they spread their mouths and eyes wide open and made the most of these occasions . Now what _could _these banished creatures find to do to keep from dying of the blues during the low-water season ! Once , in one of these lovely island chutes , we found our course completely bridged by a great fallen tree . This will serve to show how narrow some of the chutes were . The passengers had an hour 's recreation in a virgin wilderness , while the boat-hands chopped the bridge away ; for there was no such thing as turning back , you comprehend . From Cairo to Baton Rouge , when the river is over its banks , you have no particular trouble in the night , for the thousand-mile wall of dense forest that guards the two banks all the way is only gapped with a farm or wood-yard opening at intervals , and so you ca n't 'get out of the river ' much easier than you could get out of a fenced lane ; but from Baton Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter . The river is more than a mile wide , and very deep -- as much as two hundred feet , in places . Both banks , for a good deal over a hundred miles , are shorn of their timber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations , with only here and there a scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees . The timber is shorn off clear to the rear of the plantations , from two to four miles . When the first frost threatens to come , the planters snatch off their crops in a hurry . When they have finished grinding the cane , they form the refuse of the stalks ( which they call _bagasse_ ) into great piles and set fire to them , though in other sugar countries the bagasse is used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills . Now the piles of damp bagasse burn slowly , and smoke like Satan 's own kitchen . An embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks of the Mississippi all the way down that lower end of the river , and this embankment is set back from the edge of the shore from ten to perhaps a hundred feet , according to circumstances ; say thirty or forty feet , as a general thing . Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of smoke from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles , when the river is over the banks , and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and see how she will feel . And see how you will feel , too ! You find yourself away out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless , that fades out and loses itself in the murky distances ; for you can not discern the thin rib of embankment , and you are always imagining you see a straggling tree when you do n't . The plantations themselves are transformed by the smoke , and look like a part of the sea . All through your watch you are tortured with the exquisite misery of uncertainty . You hope you are keeping in the river , but you do not know . All that you are sure about is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank and destruction , when you think you are a good half-mile from shore . And you are sure , also , that if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the embankment and topple your chimneys overboard , you will have the small comfort of knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do . One of the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation one night , at such a time , and had to stay there a week . But there was no novelty about it ; it had often been done before . I thought I had finished this chapter , but I wish to add a curious thing , while it is in my mind . It is only relevant in that it is connected with piloting . There used to be an excellent pilot on the river , a Mr. X. , who was a somnambulist . It was said that if his mind was troubled about a bad piece of river , he was pretty sure to get up and walk in his sleep and do strange things . He was once fellow-pilot for a trip or two with George Ealer , on a great New Orleans passenger packet . During a considerable part of the first trip George was uneasy , but got over it by and by , as X. seemed content to stay in his bed when asleep . Late one night the boat was approaching Helena , Arkansas ; the water was low , and the crossing above the town in a very blind and tangled condition . X. had seen the crossing since Ealer had , and as the night was particularly drizzly , sullen , and dark , Ealer was considering whether he had not better have X. called to assist in running the place , when the door opened and X. walked in . Now on very dark nights , light is a deadly enemy to piloting ; you are aware that if you stand in a lighted room , on such a night , you can not see things in the street to any purpose ; but if you put out the lights and stand in the gloom you can make out objects in the street pretty well . So , on very dark nights , pilots do not smoke ; they allow no fire in the pilot-house stove if there is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape ; they order the furnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the sky-lights to be closely blinded . Then no light whatever issues from the boat . The undefinable shape that now entered the pilot-house had Mr . X . 's voice . This said -- 'Let me take her , George ; I 've seen this place since you have , and it is so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself easier than I could tell you how to do it . ' 'It is kind of you , and I swear _I_ am willing . I have n't got another drop of perspiration left in me . I have been spinning around and around the wheel like a squirrel . It is so dark I ca n't tell which way she is swinging till she is coming around like a whirligig . ' So Ealer took a seat on the bench , panting and breathless . The black phantom assumed the wheel without saying anything , steadied the waltzing steamer with a turn or two , and then stood at ease , coaxing her a little to this side and then to that , as gently and as sweetly as if the time had been noonday . When Ealer observed this marvel of steering , he wished he had not confessed ! He stared , and wondered , and finally said -- 'Well , I thought I knew how to steer a steamboat , but that was another mistake of mine . ' X. said nothing , but went serenely on with his work . Ealer let his long-pent breath pour out in a great , relieving sigh , and said -- 'That 's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done on the Mississippi River ! I would n't believed it could be done , if I hadn't seen it . ' There was no reply , and he added -- 'Just hold her five minutes longer , partner , and let me run down and get a cup of coffee . ' A minute later Ealer was biting into a pie , down in the 'texas , ' and comforting himself with coffee . Just then the night watchman happened in , and was about to happen out again , when he noticed Ealer and exclaimed -- 'Who is at the wheel , sir ? ' ' X . ' 'Dart for the pilot-house , quicker than lightning ! ' The next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house companion way , three steps at a jump ! Nobody there ! The great steamer was whistling down the middle of the river at her own sweet will ! The watchman shot out of the place again ; Ealer seized the wheel , set an engine back with power , and held his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from a 'towhead ' which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico ! By and by the watchman came back and said -- 'Did n't that lunatic tell you he was asleep , when he first came up here ? ' '_No_ . ' 'Well , he was . I found him walking along on top of the railings just as unconcerned as another man would walk a pavement ; and I put him to bed ; now just this minute there he was again , away astern , going through that sort of tight-rope deviltry the same as before . ' 'Well , I think I 'll stay by , next time he has one of those fits . But I hope he 'll have them often . You just ought to have seen him take this boat through Helena crossing . I never saw anything so gaudy before . And if he can do such gold-leaf , kid-glove , diamond-breastpin piloting when he is sound asleep , what _couldn't_ he do if he was dead ! ' CHAPTER 12 Sounding WHEN the river is very low , and one 's steamboat is 'drawing all the water ' there is in the channel , -- or a few inches more , as was often the case in the old times , -- one must be painfully circumspect in his piloting . We used to have to 'sound ' a number of particularly bad places almost every trip when the river was at a very low stage . Sounding is done in this way . The boat ties up at the shore , just above the shoal crossing ; the pilot not on watch takes his 'cub ' or steersman and a picked crew of men ( sometimes an officer also ) , and goes out in the yawl -- provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous luxury , a regularly-devised 'sounding-boat ' -- and proceeds to hunt for the best water , the pilot on duty watching his movements through a spy-glass , meantime , and in some instances assisting by signals of the boat's whistle , signifying 'try higher up ' or 'try lower down ; ' for the surface of the water , like an oil-painting , is more expressive and intelligible when inspected from a little distance than very close at hand . The whistle signals are seldom necessary , however ; never , perhaps , except when the wind confuses the significant ripples upon the water 's surface . When the yawl has reached the shoal place , the speed is slackened , the pilot begins to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long , and the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to 'hold her up to starboard ; ' or , 'let her fall off to larboard ; ' { footnote [ The term 'larboard ' is never used at sea now , to signify the left hand ; but was always used on the river in my time ] } or 'steady -- steady as you go . ' When the measurements indicate that the yawl is approaching the shoalest part of the reef , the command is given to 'ease all ! ' Then the men stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the current . The next order is , 'Stand by with the buoy ! ' The moment the shallowest point is reached , the pilot delivers the order , 'Let go the buoy ! ' and over she goes . If the pilot is not satisfied , he sounds the place again ; if he finds better water higher up or lower down , he removes the buoy to that place . Being finally satisfied , he gives the order , and all the men stand their oars straight up in the air , in line ; a blast from the boat 's whistle indicates that the signal has been seen ; then the men 'give way ' on their oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy ; the steamer comes creeping carefully down , is pointed straight at the buoy , husbands her power for the coming struggle , and presently , at the critical moment , turns on all her steam and goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and the sand , and gains the deep water beyond . Or maybe she does n't ; maybe she 'strikes and swings . ' Then she has to while away several hours ( or days ) sparring herself off . Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all , but the yawl goes ahead , hunting the best water , and the steamer follows along in its wake . Often there is a deal of fun and excitement about sounding , especially if it is a glorious summer day , or a blustering night . But in winter the cold and the peril take most of the fun out of it . A buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long , with one end turned up ; it is a reversed school-house bench , with one of the supports left and the other removed . It is anchored on the shoalest part of the reef by a rope with a heavy stone made fast to the end of it . But for the resistance of the turned-up end of the reversed bench , the current would pull the buoy under water . At night , a paper lantern with a candle in it is fastened on top of the buoy , and this can be seen a mile or more , a little glimmering spark in the waste of blackness . Nothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go out sounding . There is such an air of adventure about it ; often there is danger ; it is so gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the stern-sheets and steer a swift yawl ; there is something fine about the exultant spring of the boat when an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the oars ; it is lovely to see the white foam stream away from the bows ; there is music in the rush of the water ; it is deliciously exhilarating , in summer , to go speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the world of wavelets is dancing in the sun . It is such grandeur , too , to the cub , to get a chance to give an order ; for often the pilot will simply say , 'Let her go about ! ' and leave the rest to the cub , who instantly cries , in his sternest tone of command , 'Ease starboard ! Strong on the larboard ! Starboard give way ! With a will , men ! ' The cub enjoys sounding for the further reason that the eyes of the passengers are watching all the yawl 's movements with absorbing interest if the time be daylight ; and if it be night he knows that those same wondering eyes are fastened upon the yawl 's lantern as it glides out into the gloom and dims away in the remote distance . One trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our pilot-house with her uncle and aunt , every day and all day long . I fell in love with her . So did Mr. Thornburg 's cub , Tom G -- -- . Tom and I had been bosom friends until this time ; but now a coolness began to arise . I told the girl a good many of my river adventures , and made myself out a good deal of a hero ; Tom tried to make himself appear to be a hero , too , and succeeded to some extent , but then he always had a way of embroidering . However , virtue is its own reward , so I was a barely perceptible trifle ahead in the contest . About this time something happened which promised handsomely for me : the pilots decided to sound the crossing at the head of 21 . This would occur about nine or ten o'clock at night , when the passengers would be still up ; it would be Mr. Thornburg 's watch , therefore my chief would have to do the sounding . We had a perfect love of a sounding-boat -- long , trim , graceful , and as fleet as a greyhound ; her thwarts were cushioned ; she carried twelve oarsmen ; one of the mates was always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew , for ours was a steamer where no end of 'style ' was put on . We tied up at the shore above 21 , and got ready . It was a foul night , and the river was so wide , there , that a landsman 's uneducated eyes could discern no opposite shore through such a gloom . The passengers were alert and interested ; everything was satisfactory . As I hurried through the engine-room , picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery , I met Tom , and could not forbear delivering myself of a mean speech -- 'Ai n't you glad _you _do n't have to go out sounding ? ' Tom was passing on , but he quickly turned , and said -- 'Now just for that , you can go and get the sounding-pole yourself . I was going after it , but I 'd see you in Halifax , now , before I 'd do it . ' 'Who wants you to get it ? I do n't . It 's in the sounding-boat . ' 'It ai n't , either . It 's been new-painted ; and it 's been up on the ladies ' cabin guards two days , drying . ' I flew back , and shortly arrived among the crowd of watching and wondering ladies just in time to hear the command : 'Give way , men ! ' I looked over , and there was the gallant sounding-boat booming away , the unprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller , and my chief sitting by him with the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool 's errand to fetch . Then that young girl said to me -- 'Oh , how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a night ! Do you think there is any danger ? ' I would rather have been stabbed . I went off , full of venom , to help in the pilot-house . By and by the boat 's lantern disappeared , and after an interval a wee spark glimmered upon the face of the water a mile away . Mr. Thornburg blew the whistle , in acknowledgment , backed the steamer out , and made for it . We flew along for a while , then slackened steam and went cautiously gliding toward the spark . Presently Mr. Thornburg exclaimed -- 'Hello , the buoy-lantern 's out ! ' He stopped the engines . A moment or two later he said -- 'Why , there it is again ! ' So he came ahead on the engines once more , and rang for the leads . Gradually the water shoaled up , and then began to deepen again ! Mr. Thornburg muttered -- 'Well , I do n't understand this . I believe that buoy has drifted off the reef . Seems to be a little too far to the left . No matter , it is safest to run over it anyhow . ' So , in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down on the light . Just as our bows were in the act of plowing over it , Mr. Thornburg seized the bell-ropes , rang a startling peal , and exclaimed -- 'My soul , it 's the sounding-boat ! ' A sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below -- a pause -- and then the sound of grinding and crashing followed . Mr. Thornburg exclaimed -- 'There ! the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat to lucifer matches ! Run ! See who is killed ! ' I was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye . My chief and the third mate and nearly all the men were safe . They had discovered their danger when it was too late to pull out of the way ; then , when the great guards overshadowed them a moment later , they were prepared and knew what to do ; at my chiefs order they sprang at the right instant , seized the guard , and were hauled aboard . The next moment the sounding-yawl swept aft to the wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms . Two of the men and the cub Tom , were missing -- a fact which spread like wildfire over the boat . The passengers came flocking to the forward gangway , ladies and all , anxious-eyed , white-faced , and talked in awed voices of the dreadful thing . And often and again I heard them say , 'Poor fellows ! poor boy , poor boy ! ' By this time the boat 's yawl was manned and away , to search for the missing . Now a faint call was heard , off to the left . The yawl had disappeared in the other direction . Half the people rushed to one side to encourage the swimmer with their shouts ; the other half rushed the other way to shriek to the yawl to turn about . By the callings , the swimmer was approaching , but some said the sound showed failing strength . The crowd massed themselves against the boiler-deck railings , leaning over and staring into the gloom ; and every faint and fainter cry wrung from them such words as , 'Ah , poor fellow , poor fellow ! is there no way to save him ? ' But still the cries held out , and drew nearer , and presently the voice said pluckily -- ' I can make it ! Stand by with a rope ! ' What a rousing cheer they gave him ! The chief mate took his stand in the glare of a torch-basket , a coil of rope in his hand , and his men grouped about him . The next moment the swimmer 's face appeared in the circle of light , and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard , limp and drenched , while cheer on cheer went up . It was that devil Tom . The yawl crew searched everywhere , but found no sign of the two men . They probably failed to catch the guard , tumbled back , and were struck by the wheel and killed . Tom had never jumped for the guard at all , but had plunged head-first into the river and dived under the wheel . It was nothing ; I could have done it easy enough , and I said so ; but everybody went on just the same , making a wonderful to do over that ass , as if he had done something great . That girl could n't seem to have enough of that pitiful 'hero ' the rest of the trip ; but little I cared ; I loathed her , any way . The way we came to mistake the sounding-boat 's lantern for the buoy-light was this . My chief said that after laying the buoy he fell away and watched it till it seemed to be secure ; then he took up a position a hundred yards below it and a little to one side of the steamer 's course , headed the sounding-boat up-stream , and waited . Having to wait some time , he and the officer got to talking ; he looked up when he judged that the steamer was about on the reef ; saw that the buoy was gone , but supposed that the steamer had already run over it ; he went on with his talk ; he noticed that the steamer was getting very close on him , but that was the correct thing ; it was her business to shave him closely , for convenience in taking him aboard ; he was expecting her to sheer off , until the last moment ; then it flashed upon him that she was trying to run him down , mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light ; so he sang out , 'Stand by to spring for the guard , men ! ' and the next instant the jump was made . CHAPTER 13 A Pilot 's Needs BUT I am wandering from what I was intending to do , that is , make plainer than perhaps appears in the previous chapters , some of the peculiar requirements of the science of piloting . First of all , there is one faculty which a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it to absolute perfection . Nothing short of perfection will do . That faculty is memory . He can not stop with merely thinking a thing is so and so ; he must know it ; for this is eminently one of the 'exact' sciences . With what scorn a pilot was looked upon , in the old times , if he ever ventured to deal in that feeble phrase ' I think , ' instead of the vigorous one ' I know ! ' One can not easily realize what a tremendous thing it is to know every trivial detail of twelve hundred miles of river and know it with absolute exactness . If you will take the longest street in New York , and travel up and down it , conning its features patiently until you know every house and window and door and lamp-post and big and little sign by heart , and know them so accurately that you can instantly name the one you are abreast of when you are set down at random in that street in the middle of an inky black night , you will then have a tolerable notion of the amount and the exactness of a pilot 's knowledge who carries the Mississippi River in his head . And then if you will go on until you know every street crossing , the character , size , and position of the crossing-stones , and the varying depth of mud in each of those numberless places , you will have some idea of what the pilot must know in order to keep a Mississippi steamer out of trouble . Next , if you will take half of the signs in that long street , and _change their places_ once a month , and still manage to know their new positions accurately on dark nights , and keep up with these repeated changes without making any mistakes , you will understand what is required of a pilot 's peerless memory by the fickle Mississippi . I think a pilot 's memory is about the most wonderful thing in the world . To know the Old and New Testaments by heart , and be able to recite them glibly , forward or backward , or begin at random anywhere in the book and recite both ways and never trip or make a mistake , is no extravagant mass of knowledge , and no marvelous facility , compared to a pilot's massed knowledge of the Mississippi and his marvelous facility in the handling of it . I make this comparison deliberately , and believe I am not expanding the truth when I do it . Many will think my figure too strong , but pilots will not . And how easily and comfortably the pilot 's memory does its work ; how placidly effortless is its way ; how _unconsciously _it lays up its vast stores , hour by hour , day by day , and never loses or mislays a single valuable package of them all ! Take an instance . ' If you were walking and talking with a friend , and another friend at your side kept up a monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A , for a couple of blocks , and then in the midst interjected an R , thus , A , A , A , A , A , R , A , A , A , etc. , and gave the R no emphasis , you would not be able to state , two or three weeks afterward , that the R had been put in , nor be able to tell what objects you were passing at the moment it was done . But you could if your memory had been patiently and laboriously trained to do that sort of thing mechanically . Give a man a tolerably fair memory to start with , and piloting will develop it into a very colossus of capability . But _only in the matters it is daily drilled in_ . Astonishing things can be done with the human memory if you will devote it faithfully to one particular line of business . At the time that wages soared so high on the Missouri River , my chief , Mr. Bixby , went up there and learned more than a thousand miles of that stream with an ease and rapidity that were astonishing . When he had seen each division once in the daytime and once at night , his education was so nearly complete that he took out a 'daylight ' license ; a few trips later he took out a full license , and went to piloting day and night -- and he ranked A 1 , too . Mr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot whose feats of memory were a constant marvel to me . However , his memory was born in him , I think , not built . For instance , somebody would mention a name . Instantly Mr. Brown would break in -- 'Oh , I knew _him_ . Sallow-faced , red-headed fellow , with a little scar on the side of his throat , like a splinter under the flesh . He was only in the Southern trade six months . That was thirteen years ago . I made a trip with him . There was five feet in the upper river then ; the “ Henry Blake ” grounded at the foot of Tower Island drawing four and a half ; the “ George Elliott ” unshipped her rudder on the wreck of the “ Sunflower ” -- ' 'Why , the “ Sunflower ” did n't sink until -- ' ' I know when she sunk ; it was three years before that , on the 2nd of December ; Asa Hardy was captain of her , and his brother John was first clerk ; and it was his first trip in her , too ; Tom Jones told me these things a week afterward in New Orleans ; he was first mate of the “ Sunflower. ” Captain Hardy stuck a nail in his foot the 6th of July of the next year , and died of the lockjaw on the 15th . His brother died two years after 3rd of March , -- erysipelas . I never saw either of the Hardys , -- they were Alleghany River men , -- but people who knew them told me all these things . And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn socks winter and summer just the same , and his first wife 's name was Jane Shook -- she was from New England -- and his second one died in a lunatic asylum . It was in the blood . She was from Lexington , Kentucky . Name was Horton before she was married . ' And so on , by the hour , the man 's tongue would go . He could _not _forget any thing . It was simply impossible . The most trivial details remained as distinct and luminous in his head , after they had lain there for years , as the most memorable events . His was not simply a pilot's memory ; its grasp was universal . If he were talking about a trifling letter he had received seven years before , he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed from memory . And then without observing that he was departing from the true line of his talk , he was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that letter ; and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer's relatives , one by one , and give you their biographies , too . Such a memory as that is a great misfortune . To it , all occurrences are of the same size . Its possessor can not distinguish an interesting circumstance from an uninteresting one . As a talker , he is bound to clog his narrative with tiresome details and make himself an insufferable bore . Moreover , he can not stick to his subject . He picks up every little grain of memory he discerns in his way , and so is led aside . Mr. Brown would start out with the honest intention of telling you a vastly funny anecdote about a dog . He would be 'so full of laugh ' that he could hardly begin ; then his memory would start with the dog 's breed and personal appearance ; drift into a history of his owner ; of his owner's family , with descriptions of weddings and burials that had occurred in it , together with recitals of congratulatory verses and obituary poetry provoked by the same : then this memory would recollect that one of these events occurred during the celebrated 'hard winter ' of such and such a year , and a minute description of that winter would follow , along with the names of people who were frozen to death , and statistics showing the high figures which pork and hay went up to . Pork and hay would suggest corn and fodder ; corn and fodder would suggest cows and horses ; cows and horses would suggest the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders ; the transition from the circus to the menagerie was easy and natural ; from the elephant to equatorial Africa was but a step ; then of course the heathen savages would suggest religion ; and at the end of three or four hours ' tedious jaw , the watch would change , and Brown would go out of the pilot-house muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years before about the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace . And the original first mention would be all you had learned about that dog , after all this waiting and hungering . A pilot must have a memory ; but there are two higher qualities which he must also have . He must have good and quick judgment and decision , and a cool , calm courage that no peril can shake . Give a man the merest trifle of pluck to start with , and by the time he has become a pilot he can not be unmanned by any danger a steamboat can get into ; but one can not quite say the same for judgment . Judgment is a matter of brains , and a man must _start _with a good stock of that article or he will never succeed as a pilot . The growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time , but it does not reach a high and satisfactory condition until some time after the young pilot has been 'standing his own watch , ' alone and under the staggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the position . When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted with the river , he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his steamboat , night or day , that he presently begins to imagine that it is _his _courage that animates him ; but the first time the pilot steps out and leaves him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man 's . He discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo altogether . The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a moment ; he is not prepared for them ; he does not know how to meet them ; all his knowledge forsakes him ; and within fifteen minutes he is as white as a sheet and scared almost to death . Therefore pilots wisely train these cubs by various strategic tricks to look danger in the face a little more calmly . A favorite way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon the candidate . Mr. Bixby served me in this fashion once , and for years afterward I used to blush even in my sleep when I thought of it . I had become a good steersman ; so good , indeed , that I had all the work to do on our watch , night and day ; Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me ; all he ever did was to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in particularly bad crossings , land the boat when she needed to be landed , play gentleman of leisure nine-tenths of the watch , and collect the wages . The lower river was about bank-full , and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any crossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or instruction , I should have felt irreparably hurt . The idea of being afraid of any crossing in the lot , in the _day-time_ , was a thing too preposterous for contemplation . Well , one matchless summer 's day I was bowling down the bend above island 66 , brimful of self-conceit and carrying my nose as high as a giraffe 's , when Mr. Bixby said -- ' I am going below a while . I suppose you know the next crossing ? ' This was almost an affront . It was about the plainest and simplest crossing in the whole river . One could n't come to any harm , whether he ran it right or not ; and as for depth , there never had been any bottom there . I knew all this , perfectly well . 'Know how to _run _it ? Why , I can run it with my eyes shut . ' 'How much water is there in it ? ' 'Well , that is an odd question . I could n't get bottom there with a church steeple . ' 'You think so , do you ? ' The very tone of the question shook my confidence . That was what Mr. Bixby was expecting . He left , without saying anything more . I began to imagine all sorts of things . Mr. Bixby , unknown to me , of course , sent somebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the leadsmen , another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers , and then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could observe results . Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck ; next the chief mate appeared ; then a clerk . Every moment or two a straggler was added to my audience ; and before I got to the head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my nose . I began to wonder what the trouble was . As I started across , the captain glanced aloft at me and said , with a sham uneasiness in his voice -- 'Where is Mr . Bixby ? ' 'Gone below , sir . ' But that did the business for me . My imagination began to construct dangers out of nothing , and they multiplied faster than I could keep the run of them . All at once I imagined I saw shoal water ahead ! The wave of coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every joint in me . All my confidence in that crossing vanished . I seized the bell-rope ; dropped it , ashamed ; seized it again ; dropped it once more ; clutched it tremblingly one again , and pulled it so feebly that I could hardly hear the stroke myself . Captain and mate sang out instantly , and both together -- 'Starboard lead there ! and quick about it ! ' This was another shock . I began to climb the wheel like a squirrel ; but I would hardly get the boat started to port before I would see new dangers on that side , and away I would spin to the other ; only to find perils accumulating to starboard , and be crazy to get to port again . Then came the leadsman 's sepulchral cry -- 'D-e-e-p four ! ' Deep four in a bottomless crossing ! The terror of it took my breath away . 'M-a-r-k three ! ... M-a-r-k three ... Quarter less three ! ... This was frightful ! I seized the bell-ropes and stopped the engines . I was helpless . I did not know what in the world to do . I was quaking from head to foot , and I could have hung my hat on my eyes , they stuck out so far . Nine and a _half_ ! ' We were _drawing _nine ! My hands were in a nerveless flutter . I could not ring a bell intelligibly with them . I flew to the speaking-tube and shouted to the engineer -- 'Oh , Ben , if you love me , _back _her ! Quick , Ben ! Oh , back the immortal _soul_ out of her ! ' I heard the door close gently . I looked around , and there stood Mr. Bixby , smiling a bland , sweet smile . Then the audience on the hurricane deck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter . I saw it all , now , and I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history . I suppose I'll never hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave the lead at the head of 66 . ' 'Well , no , you wo n't , maybe . In fact I hope you wo n't ; for I want you to learn something by that experience . Did n't you _know _there was no bottom in that crossing ? ' 'Yes , sir , I did . ' 'Very well , then . You should n't have allowed me or anybody else to shake your confidence in that knowledge . Try to remember that . And another thing : when you get into a dangerous place , do n't turn coward . That is n't going to help matters any . ' It was a good enough lesson , but pretty hardly learned . Yet about the hardest part of it was that for months I so often had to hear a phrase which I had conceived a particular distaste for . It was , 'Oh , Ben , if you love me , back her ! ' CHAPTER 14 Rank and Dignity of Piloting IN my preceding chapters I have tried , by going into the minutiae of the science of piloting , to carry the reader step by step to a comprehension of what the science consists of ; and at the same time I have tried to show him that it is a very curious and wonderful science , too , and very worthy of his attention . If I have seemed to love my subject , it is no surprising thing , for I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since , and I took a measureless pride in it . The reason is plain : a pilot , in those days , was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the earth . Kings are but the hampered servants of parliament and people ; parliaments sit in chains forged by their constituency ; the editor of a newspaper can not be independent , but must work with one hand tied behind him by party and patrons , and be content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind ; no clergyman is a free man and may speak the whole truth , regardless of his parish 's opinions ; writers of all kinds are manacled servants of the public . We write frankly and fearlessly , but then we 'modify ' before we print . In truth , every man and woman and child has a master , and worries and frets in servitude ; but in the day I write of , the Mississippi pilot had none . The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck , in the pomp of a very brief authority , and give him five or six orders while the vessel backed into the stream , and then that skipper 's reign was over . The moment that the boat was under way in the river , she was under the sole and unquestioned control of the pilot . He could do with her exactly as he pleased , run her when and whither he chose , and tie her up to the bank whenever his judgment said that that course was best . His movements were entirely free ; he consulted no one , he received commands from nobody , he promptly resented even the merest suggestions . Indeed , the law of the United States forbade him to listen to commands or suggestions , rightly considering that the pilot necessarily knew better how to handle the boat than anybody could tell him . So here was the novelty of a king without a keeper , an absolute monarch who was absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of words . I have seen a boy of eighteen taking a great steamer serenely into what seemed almost certain destruction , and the aged captain standing mutely by , filled with apprehension but powerless to interfere . His interference , in that particular instance , might have been an excellent thing , but to permit it would have been to establish a most pernicious precedent . It will easily be guessed , considering the pilot 's boundless authority , that he was a great personage in the old steamboating days . I think pilots were about the only people I ever knew who failed to show , in some degree , embarrassment in the presence of traveling foreign princes . But then , people in one 's own grade of life are not usually embarrassing objects . By long habit , pilots came to put all their wishes in the form of commands . It 'gravels ' me , to this day , to put my will in the weak shape of a request , instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order . In those old days , to load a steamboat at St. Louis , take her to New Orleans and back , and discharge cargo , consumed about twenty-five days , on an average . Seven or eight of these days the boat spent at the wharves of St. Louis and New Orleans , and every soul on board was hard at work , except the two pilots ; they did nothing but play gentleman up town , and receive the same wages for it as if they had been on duty . The moment the boat touched the wharf at either city , they were ashore ; and they were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing and everything in readiness for another voyage . When a captain got hold of a pilot of particularly high reputation , he took pains to keep him . When wages were four hundred dollars a month on the Upper Mississippi , I have known a captain to keep such a pilot in idleness , under full pay , three months at a time , while the river was frozen up . And one must remember that in those cheap times four hundred dollars was a salary of almost inconceivable splendor . Few men on shore got such pay as that , and when they did they were mightily looked up to . When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our small Missouri village , they were sought by the best and the fairest , and treated with exalted respect . Lying in port under wages was a thing which many pilots greatly enjoyed and appreciated ; especially if they belonged in the Missouri River in the heyday of that trade ( Kansas times ) , and got nine hundred dollars a trip , which was equivalent to about eighteen hundred dollars a month . Here is a conversation of that day . A chap out of the Illinois River , with a little stern-wheel tub , accosts a couple of ornate and gilded Missouri River pilots -- 'Gentlemen , I 've got a pretty good trip for the upcountry , and shall want you about a month . How much will it be ? ' 'Eighteen hundred dollars apiece . ' 'Heavens and earth ! You take my boat , let me have your wages , and I'll divide ! ' For instance , it was a proud thing to be of the crew of such stately craft as the 'Aleck Scott ' or the 'Grand Turk . ' Negro firemen , deck hands , and barbers belonging to those boats were distinguished personages in their grade of life , and they were well aware of that fact too . A stalwart darkey once gave offense at a negro ball in New Orleans by putting on a good many airs . Finally one of the managers bustled up to him and said -- 'Who _is_ you , any way ? Who is you ? dat 's what I wants to know ! ' The offender was not disconcerted in the least , but swelled himself up and threw that into his voice which showed that he knew he was not putting on all those airs on a stinted capital . 'Who _is_ I ? Who _is _I ? I let you know mighty quick who I is ! I want you niggers to understan ' dat I fires de middle do ' { footnote [ Door ] } on de “ Aleck Scott ! ” ' That was sufficient . The barber of the 'Grand Turk ' was a spruce young negro , who aired his importance with balmy complacency , and was greatly courted by the circle in which he moved . The young colored population of New Orleans were much given to flirting , at twilight , on the banquettes of the back streets . Somebody saw and heard something like the following , one evening , in one of those localities . A middle-aged negro woman projected her head through a broken pane and shouted ( very willing that the neighbors should hear and envy ) , 'You Mary Ann , come in de house dis minute ! Stannin ' out dah foolin ' 'long wid dat low trash , an ' heah 's de barber offn de “ Gran ' Turk ” wants to conwerse wid you ! ' My reference , a moment ago , to the fact that a pilot 's peculiar official position placed him out of the reach of criticism or command , brings Stephen W -- -- naturally to my mind . He was a gifted pilot , a good fellow , a tireless talker , and had both wit and humor in him . He had a most irreverent independence , too , and was deliciously easy-going and comfortable in the presence of age , official dignity , and even the most august wealth . He always had work , he never saved a penny , he was a most persuasive borrower , he was in debt to every pilot on the river , and to the majority of the captains . He could throw a sort of splendor around a bit of harum-scarum , devil-may-care piloting , that made it almost fascinating -- but not to everybody . He made a trip with good old Captain Y -- -- once , and was 'relieved ' from duty when the boat got to New Orleans . Somebody expressed surprise at the discharge . Captain Y -- -- shuddered at the mere mention of Stephen . Then his poor , thin old voice piped out something like this : -- 'Why , bless me ! I would n't have such a wild creature on my boat for the world -- not for the whole world ! He swears , he sings , he whistles , he yells -- I never saw such an Injun to yell . All times of the night -- it never made any difference to him . He would just yell that way , not for anything in particular , but merely on account of a kind of devilish comfort he got out of it . I never could get into a sound sleep but he would fetch me out of bed , all in a cold sweat , with one of those dreadful war-whoops . A queer being -- very queer being ; no respect for anything or anybody . Sometimes he called me “ Johnny. ” And he kept a fiddle , and a cat . He played execrably . This seemed to distress the cat , and so the cat would howl . Nobody could sleep where that man -- and his family -- was . And reckless . There never was anything like it . Now you may believe it or not , but as sure as I am sitting here , he brought my boat a-tilting down through those awful snags at Chicot under a rattling head of steam , and the wind a-blowing like the very nation , at that ! My officers will tell you so . They saw it . And , sir , while he was a-tearing right down through those snags , and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying , I wish I may never speak again if he did n't pucker up his mouth and go to _whistling_ ! Yes , sir ; whistling “ Buffalo gals , ca n't you come out tonight , ca n't you come out to-night , ca n't you come out to-night ; ” and doing it as calmly as if we were attending a funeral and were n't related to the corpse . And when I remonstrated with him about it , he smiled down on me as if I was his child , and told me to run in the house and try to be good , and not be meddling with my superiors ! ' Once a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans out of work and as usual out of money . He laid steady siege to Stephen , who was in a very 'close place , ' and finally persuaded him to hire with him at one hundred and twenty-five dollars per month , just half wages , the captain agreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the contempt of all the guild upon the poor fellow . But the boat was not more than a day out of New Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting of his exploit , and that all the officers had been told . Stephen winced , but said nothing . About the middle of the afternoon the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck , cast his eye around , and looked a good deal surprised . He glanced inquiringly aloft at Stephen , but Stephen was whistling placidly , and attending to business . The captain stood around a while in evident discomfort , and once or twice seemed about to make a suggestion ; but the etiquette of the river taught him to avoid that sort of rashness , and so he managed to hold his peace . He chafed and puzzled a few minutes longer , then retired to his apartments . But soon he was out again , and apparently more perplexed than ever . 'Well , I should say so ! Bank-full _is_ a pretty liberal stage . ' 'Seems to be a good deal of current here . ' 'Good deal do n't describe it ! It 's worse than a mill-race . ' 'Is n't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the middle ? ' 'Yes , I reckon it is ; but a body ca n't be too careful with a steamboat . It 's pretty safe out here ; ca n't strike any bottom here , you can depend on that . ' The captain departed , looking rueful enough . At this rate , he would probably die of old age before his boat got to St. Louis . Next day he appeared on deck and again found Stephen faithfully standing up the middle of the river , fighting the whole vast force of the Mississippi , and whistling the same placid tune . This thing was becoming serious . In by the shore was a slower boat clipping along in the easy water and gaining steadily ; she began to make for an island chute ; Stephen stuck to the middle of the river . Speech was _wrung _from the captain . He said -- 'Mr . W -- -- , do n't that chute cut off a good deal of distance ? ' ' I think it does , but I do n't know . ' 'Do n't know ! Well , is n't there water enough in it now to go through ? ' ' I expect there is , but I am not certain . ' 'Upon my word this is odd ! Why , those pilots on that boat yonder are going to try it . Do you mean to say that you do n't know as much as they do ? ' '_They_ ! Why , _they _are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots ! But do n't you be uneasy ; I know as much as any man can afford to know for a hundred and twenty-five ! ' The captain surrendered . Five minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute and showing the rival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pair of heels . CHAPTER 15 The Pilots ' Monopoly ONE day , on board the 'Aleck Scott , ' my chief , Mr. Bixby , was crawling carefully through a close place at Cat Island , both leads going , and everybody holding his breath . The captain , a nervous , apprehensive man , kept still as long as he could , but finally broke down and shouted from the hurricane deck -- 'For gracious ' sake , give her steam , Mr. Bixby ! give her steam ! She'll never raise the reef on this headway ! ' But five minutes later , when the danger was past and the leads laid in , he burst instantly into a consuming fury , and gave the captain the most admirable cursing I ever listened to . No bloodshed ensued ; but that was because the captain's cause was weak ; for ordinarily he was not a man to take correction quietly . Having now set forth in detail the nature of the science of piloting , and likewise described the rank which the pilot held among the fraternity of steamboatmen , this seems a fitting place to say a few words about an organization which the pilots once formed for the protection of their guild . It was curious and noteworthy in this , that it was perhaps the compactest , the completest , and the strongest commercial organization ever formed among men . For a long time wages had been two hundred and fifty dollars a month ; but curiously enough , as steamboats multiplied and business increased , the wages began to fall little by little . It was easy to discover the reason of this . Too many pilots were being 'made . ' It was nice to have a 'cub , ' a steersman , to do all the hard work for a couple of years , gratis , while his master sat on a high bench and smoked ; all pilots and captains had sons or nephews who wanted to be pilots . By and by it came to pass that nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman . When a steersman had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any two pilots in the trade , they could get a pilot 's license for him by signing an application directed to the United States Inspector . Nothing further was needed ; usually no questions were asked , no proofs of capacity required . Very well , this growing swarm of new pilots presently began to undermine the wages , in order to get berths . Too late -- apparently -- the knights of the tiller perceived their mistake . Plainly , something had to be done , and quickly ; but what was to be the needful thing . A close organization . Nothing else would answer . To compass this seemed an impossibility ; so it was talked , and talked , and then dropped . It was too likely to ruin whoever ventured to move in the matter . But at last about a dozen of the boldest -- and some of them the best -- pilots on the river launched themselves into the enterprise and took all the chances . They got a special charter from the legislature , with large powers , under the name of the Pilots ' Benevolent Association ; elected their officers , completed their organization , contributed capital , put 'association ' wages up to two hundred and fifty dollars at once -- and then retired to their homes , for they were promptly discharged from employment . But there were two or three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds of propagation in them . For instance , all idle members of the association , in good standing , were entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per month . This began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks of the new-fledged pilots , in the dull ( summer ) season . Better have twenty-five dollars than starve ; the initiation fee was only twelve dollars , and no dues required from the unemployed . Also , the widows of deceased members in good standing could draw twenty-five dollars per month , and a certain sum for each of their children . Also , the said deceased would be buried at the association's expense . These things resurrected all the superannuated and forgotten pilots in the Mississippi Valley . They came from farms , they came from interior villages , they came from everywhere . They came on crutches , on drays , in ambulances , -- any way , so they got there . They paid in their twelve dollars , and straightway began to draw out twenty-five dollars a month , and calculate their burial bills . By and by , all the useless , helpless pilots , and a dozen first-class ones , were in the association , and nine-tenths of the best pilots out of it and laughing at it . It was the laughing-stock of the whole river . Everybody joked about the by-law requiring members to pay ten per cent . of their wages , every month , into the treasury for the support of the association , whereas all the members were outcast and tabooed , and no one would employ them . Everybody was derisively grateful to the association for taking all the worthless pilots out of the way and leaving the whole field to the excellent and the deserving ; and everybody was not only jocularly grateful for that , but for a result which naturally followed , namely , the gradual advance of wages as the busy season approached . Wages had gone up from the low figure of one hundred dollars a month to one hundred and twenty-five , and in some cases to one hundred and fifty ; and it was great fun to enlarge upon the fact that this charming thing had been accomplished by a body of men not one of whom received a particle of benefit from it . Some of the jokers used to call at the association rooms and have a good time chaffing the members and offering them the charity of taking them as steersmen for a trip , so that they could see what the forgotten river looked like . However , the association was content ; or at least it gave no sign to the contrary . Now and then it captured a pilot who was 'out of luck , ' and added him to its list ; and these later additions were very valuable , for they were good pilots ; the incompetent ones had all been absorbed before . As business freshened , wages climbed gradually up to two hundred and fifty dollars -- the association figure -- and became firmly fixed there ; and still without benefiting a member of that body , for no member was hired . The hilarity at the association 's expense burst all bounds , now . There was no end to the fun which that poor martyr had to put up with . However , it is a long lane that has no turning . Winter approached , business doubled and trebled , and an avalanche of Missouri , Illinois and Upper Mississippi River boats came pouring down to take a chance in the New Orleans trade . All of a sudden pilots were in great demand , and were correspondingly scarce . The time for revenge was come . It was a bitter pill to have to accept association pilots at last , yet captains and owners agreed that there was no other way . But none of these outcasts offered ! So there was a still bitterer pill to be swallowed : they must be sought out and asked for their services . Captain -- -- was the first man who found it necessary to take the dose , and he had been the loudest derider of the organization . He hunted up one of the best of the association pilots and said -- 'Well , you boys have rather got the best of us for a little while , so I 'll give in with as good a grace as I can . I 've come to hire you ; get your trunk aboard right away . I want to leave at twelve o'clock . ' ' I do n't know about that . Who is your other pilot ? ' ' I 've got I . S -- -- . Why ? ' ' I ca n't go with him . He do n't belong to the association . ' 'What ! ' 'It 's so . ' 'Do you mean to tell me that you wo n't turn a wheel with one of the very best and oldest pilots on the river because he do n't belong to your association ? ' 'Yes , I do . ' 'Well , if this is n't putting on airs ! I supposed I was doing you a benevolence ; but I begin to think that I am the party that wants a favor done . Are you acting under a law of the concern ? ' 'Yes . ' 'Show it to me . ' So they stepped into the association rooms , and the secretary soon satisfied the captain , who said -- 'Well , what am I to do ? I have hired Mr. S -- -- for the entire season . ' ' I will provide for you , ' said the secretary . ' I will detail a pilot to go with you , and he shall be on board at twelve o'clock . ' 'But if I discharge S -- -- , he will come on me for the whole season's wages . ' 'Of course that is a matter between you and Mr. S -- -- , captain . We can not meddle in your private affairs . ' The captain stormed , but to no purpose . In the end he had to discharge S -- -- , pay him about a thousand dollars , and take an association pilot in his place . The laugh was beginning to turn the other way now . Every day , thenceforward , a new victim fell ; every day some outraged captain discharged a non-association pet , with tears and profanity , and installed a hated association man in his berth . In a very little while , idle non-associationists began to be pretty plenty , brisk as business was , and much as their services were desired . The laugh was shifting to the other side of their mouths most palpably . These victims , together with the captains and owners , presently ceased to laugh altogether , and began to rage about the revenge they would take when the passing business 'spurt ' was over . Soon all the laughers that were left were the owners and crews of boats that had two non-association pilots . But their triumph was not very long-lived . For this reason : It was a rigid rule of the association that its members should never , under any circumstances whatever , give information about the channel to any 'outsider . ' By this time about half the boats had none but association pilots , and the other half had none but outsiders . At the first glance one would suppose that when it came to forbidding information about the river these two parties could play equally at that game ; but this was not so . At every good-sized town from one end of the river to the other , there was a 'wharf-boat ' to land at , instead of a wharf or a pier . Freight was stored in it for transportation ; waiting passengers slept in its cabins . Upon each of these wharf-boats the association 's officers placed a strong box fastened with a peculiar lock which was used in no other service but one -- the United States mail service . It was the letter-bag lock , a sacred governmental thing . By dint of much beseeching the government had been persuaded to allow the association to use this lock . Every association man carried a key which would open these boxes . That key , or rather a peculiar way of holding it in the hand when its owner was asked for river information by a stranger -- for the success of the St. Louis and New Orleans association had now bred tolerably thriving branches in a dozen neighboring steamboat trades -- was the association man 's sign and diploma of membership ; and if the stranger did not respond by producing a similar key and holding it in a certain manner duly prescribed , his question was politely ignored . From the association 's secretary each member received a package of more or less gorgeous blanks , printed like a billhead , on handsome paper , properly ruled in columns ; a bill-head worded something like this -- These blanks were filled up , day by day , as the voyage progressed , and deposited in the several wharf-boat boxes . For instance , as soon as the first crossing , out from St. Louis , was completed , the items would be entered upon the blank , under the appropriate headings , thus -- 'St . Louis . Nine and a half ( feet ) . Stern on court-house , head on dead cottonwood above wood-yard , until you raise the first reef , then pull up square . ' New snag just where you straighten down ; go above it . ' The pilot who deposited that blank in the Cairo box ( after adding to it the details of every crossing all the way down from St. Louis ) took out and read half a dozen fresh reports ( from upward-bound steamers ) concerning the river between Cairo and Memphis , posted himself thoroughly , returned them to the box , and went back aboard his boat again so armed against accident that he could not possibly get his boat into trouble without bringing the most ingenious carelessness to his aid . Imagine the benefits of so admirable a system in a piece of river twelve or thirteen hundred miles long , whose channel was shifting every day ! The pilot who had formerly been obliged to put up with seeing a shoal place once or possibly twice a month , had a hundred sharp eyes to watch it for him , now , and bushels of intelligent brains to tell him how to run it . His information about it was seldom twenty-four hours old . If the reports in the last box chanced to leave any misgivings on his mind concerning a treacherous crossing , he had his remedy ; he blew his steam-whistle in a peculiar way as soon as he saw a boat approaching ; the signal was answered in a peculiar way if that boat 's pilots were association men ; and then the two steamers ranged alongside and all uncertainties were swept away by fresh information furnished to the inquirer by word of mouth and in minute detail . The first thing a pilot did when he reached New Orleans or St. Louis was to take his final and elaborate report to the association parlors and hang it up there , -- after which he was free to visit his family . In these parlors a crowd was always gathered together , discussing changes in the channel , and the moment there was a fresh arrival , everybody stopped talking till this witness had told the newest news and settled the latest uncertainty . Other craftsmen can 'sink the shop , ' sometimes , and interest themselves in other matters . Not so with a pilot ; he must devote himself wholly to his profession and talk of nothing else ; for it would be small gain to be perfect one day and imperfect the next . He has no time or words to waste if he would keep 'posted . ' But the outsiders had a hard time of it . No particular place to meet and exchange information , no wharf-boat reports , none but chance and unsatisfactory ways of getting news . The consequence was that a man sometimes had to run five hundred miles of river on information that was a week or ten days old . At a fair stage of the river that might have answered ; but when the dead low water came it was destructive . Now came another perfectly logical result . The outsiders began to ground steamboats , sink them , and get into all sorts of trouble , whereas accidents seemed to keep entirely away from the association men . Wherefore even the owners and captains of boats furnished exclusively with outsiders , and previously considered to be wholly independent of the association and free to comfort themselves with brag and laughter , began to feel pretty uncomfortable . Still , they made a show of keeping up the brag , until one black day when every captain of the lot was formally ordered to immediately discharge his outsiders and take association pilots in their stead . And who was it that had the dashing presumption to do that ? Alas , it came from a power behind the throne that was greater than the throne itself . It was the underwriters ! It was no time to 'swap knives . ' Every outsider had to take his trunk ashore at once . Of course it was supposed that there was collusion between the association and the underwriters , but this was not so . The latter had come to comprehend the excellence of the 'report ' system of the association and the safety it secured , and so they had made their decision among themselves and upon plain business principles . There was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp of the outsiders now . But no matter , there was but one course for them to pursue , and they pursued it . They came forward in couples and groups , and proffered their twelve dollars and asked for membership . They were surprised to learn that several new by-laws had been long ago added . For instance , the initiation fee had been raised to fifty dollars ; that sum must be tendered , and also ten per cent . of the wages which the applicant had received each and every month since the founding of the association . In many cases this amounted to three or four hundred dollars . Still , the association would not entertain the application until the money was present . Even then a single adverse vote killed the application . Every member had to vote 'Yes ' or 'No ' in person and before witnesses ; so it took weeks to decide a candidacy , because many pilots were so long absent on voyages . However , the repentant sinners scraped their savings together , and one by one , by our tedious voting process , they were added to the fold . A time came , at last , when only about ten remained outside . They said they would starve before they would apply . They remained idle a long while , because of course nobody could venture to employ them . By and by the association published the fact that upon a certain date the wages would be raised to five hundred dollars per month . All the branch associations had grown strong , now , and the Red River one had advanced wages to seven hundred dollars a month . Reluctantly the ten outsiders yielded , in view of these things , and made application . There was another new by-law , by this time , which required them to pay dues not only on all the wages they had received since the association was born , but also on what they would have received if they had continued at work up to the time of their application , instead of going off to pout in idleness . It turned out to be a difficult matter to elect them , but it was accomplished at last . The most virulent sinner of this batch had stayed out and allowed 'dues ' to accumulate against him so long that he had to send in six hundred and twenty-five dollars with his application . The association had a good bank account now , and was very strong . There was no longer an outsider . A by-law was added forbidding the reception of any more cubs or apprentices for five years ; after which time a limited number would be taken , not by individuals , but by the association , upon these terms : the applicant must not be less than eighteen years old , and of respectable family and good character ; he must pass an examination as to education , pay a thousand dollars in advance for the privilege of becoming an apprentice , and must remain under the commands of the association until a great part of the membership ( more than half , I think ) should be willing to sign his application for a pilot 's license . All previously-articled apprentices were now taken away from their masters and adopted by the association . The president and secretary detailed them for service on one boat or another , as they chose , and changed them from boat to boat according to certain rules . If a pilot could show that he was in infirm health and needed assistance , one of the cubs would be ordered to go with him . The widow and orphan list grew , but so did the association 's financial resources . The association attended its own funerals in state , and paid for them . When occasion demanded , it sent members down the river upon searches for the bodies of brethren lost by steamboat accidents ; a search of this kind sometimes cost a thousand dollars . The association procured a charter and went into the insurance business , also . It not only insured the lives of its members , but took risks on steamboats . The organization seemed indestructible . It was the tightest monopoly in the world . By the United States law , no man could become a pilot unless two duly licensed pilots signed his application ; and now there was nobody outside of the association competent to sign . Consequently the making of pilots was at an end . Every year some would die and others become incapacitated by age and infirmity ; there would be no new ones to take their places . In time , the association could put wages up to any figure it chose ; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry the thing too far and provoke the national government into amending the licensing system , steamboat owners would have to submit , since there would be no help for it . The owners and captains were the only obstruction that lay between the association and absolute power ; and at last this one was removed . Incredible as it may seem , the owners and captains deliberately did it themselves . When the pilots ' association announced , months beforehand , that on the first day of September , 1861 , wages would be advanced to five hundred dollars per month , the owners and captains instantly put freights up a few cents , and explained to the farmers along the river the necessity of it , by calling their attention to the burdensome rate of wages about to be established . It was a rather slender argument , but the farmers did not seem to detect it . It looked reasonable to them that to add five cents freight on a bushel of corn was justifiable under the circumstances , overlooking the fact that this advance on a cargo of forty thousand sacks was a good deal more than necessary to cover the new wages . So , straightway the captains and owners got up an association of their own , and proposed to put captains ' wages up to five hundred dollars , too , and move for another advance in freights . It was a novel idea , but of course an effect which had been produced once could be produced again . The new association decreed ( for this was before all the outsiders had been taken into the pilots ' association ) that if any captain employed a non-association pilot , he should be forced to discharge him , and also pay a fine of five hundred dollars . Several of these heavy fines were paid before the captains ' organization grew strong enough to exercise full authority over its membership ; but that all ceased , presently . The captains tried to get the pilots to decree that no member of their corporation should serve under a non-association captain ; but this proposition was declined . The pilots saw that they would be backed up by the captains and the underwriters anyhow , and so they wisely refrained from entering into entangling alliances . And yet the days of its glory were numbered . First , the new railroad stretching up through Mississippi , Tennessee , and Kentucky , to Northern railway centers , began to divert the passenger travel from the steamers ; next the war came and almost entirely annihilated the steamboating industry during several years , leaving most of the pilots idle , and the cost of living advancing all the time ; then the treasurer of the St. Louis association put his hand into the till and walked off with every dollar of the ample fund ; and finally , the railroads intruding everywhere , there was little for steamers to do , when the war was over , but carry freights ; so straightway some genius from the Atlantic coast introduced the plan of towing a dozen steamer cargoes down to New Orleans at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat ; and behold , in the twinkling of an eye , as it were , the association and the noble science of piloting were things of the dead and pathetic past ! CHAPTER 16 Racing Days IT was always the custom for the boats to leave New Orleans between four and five o'clock in the afternoon . From three o'clock onward they would be burning rosin and pitch pine ( the sign of preparation ) , and so one had the picturesque spectacle of a rank , some two or three miles long , of tall , ascending columns of coal-black smoke ; a colonnade which supported a sable roof of the same smoke blended together and spreading abroad over the city . Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at the jack-staff , and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern . Two or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with more than usual emphasis ; countless processions of freight barrels and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying aboard the stage-planks , belated passengers were dodging and skipping among these frantic things , hoping to reach the forecastle companion way alive , but having their doubts about it ; women with reticules and bandboxes were trying to keep up with husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies , and making a failure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and roar and general distraction ; drays and baggage-vans were clattering hither and thither in a wild hurry , every now and then getting blocked and jammed together , and then during ten seconds one could not see them for the profanity , except vaguely and dimly ; every windlass connected with every forehatch , from one end of that long array of steamboats to the other , was keeping up a deafening whiz and whir , lowering freight into the hold , and the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked them were roaring such songs as 'De Las ' Sack ! De Las ' Sack ! ' -- inspired to unimaginable exaltation by the chaos of turmoil and racket that was driving everybody else mad . By this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers would be packed and black with passengers . The 'last bells ' would begin to clang , all down the line , and then the powwow seemed to double ; in a moment or two the final warning came , -- a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs , with the cry , 'All dat ai n't goin ' , please to git asho ' ! ' -- and behold , the powwow quadrupled ! People came swarming ashore , overturning excited stragglers that were trying to swarm aboard . One more moment later a long array of stage-planks was being hauled in , each with its customary latest passenger clinging to the end of it with teeth , nails , and everything else , and the customary latest procrastinator making a wild spring shoreward over his head . Now a number of the boats slide backward into the stream , leaving wide gaps in the serried rank of steamers . Citizens crowd the decks of boats that are not to go , in order to see the sight . Steamer after steamer straightens herself up , gathers all her strength , and presently comes swinging by , under a tremendous head of steam , with flag flying , black smoke rolling , and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands ( usually swarthy negroes ) massed together on the forecastle , the best 'voice ' in the lot towering from the midst ( being mounted on the capstan ) , waving his hat or a flag , and all roaring a mighty chorus , while the parting cannons boom and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and huzza ! Steamer after steamer falls into line , and the stately procession goes winging its flight up the river . In the old times , whenever two fast boats started out on a race , with a big crowd of people looking on , it was inspiring to hear the crews sing , especially if the time were night-fall , and the forecastle lit up with the red glare of the torch-baskets . Racing was royal fun . The public always had an idea that racing was dangerous ; whereas the opposite was the case -- that is , after the laws were passed which restricted each boat to just so many pounds of steam to the square inch . No engineer was ever sleepy or careless when his heart was in a race . He was constantly on the alert , trying gauge-cocks and watching things . The dangerous place was on slow , plodding boats , where the engineers drowsed around and allowed chips to get into the 'doctor ' and shut off the water supply from the boilers . In the 'flush times ' of steamboating , a race between two notoriously fleet steamers was an event of vast importance . The date was set for it several weeks in advance , and from that time forward , the whole Mississippi Valley was in a state of consuming excitement . Politics and the weather were dropped , and people talked only of the coming race . As the time approached , the two steamers 'stripped ' and got ready . Every encumbrance that added weight , or exposed a resisting surface to wind or water , was removed , if the boat could possibly do without it . The 'spars , ' and sometimes even their supporting derricks , were sent ashore , and no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground . When the 'Eclipse ' and the ' A . L. Shotwell ' ran their great race many years ago , it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the fanciful device which hung between the 'Eclipse 's ' chimneys , and that for that one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and had his head shaved . But I always doubted these things . If the boat was known to make her best speed when drawing five and a half feet forward and five feet aft , she was carefully loaded to that exact figure -- she would n't enter a dose of homoeopathic pills on her manifest after that . Hardly any passengers were taken , because they not only add weight but they never will 'trim boat . ' They always run to the side when there is anything to see , whereas a conscientious and experienced steamboatman would stick to the center of the boat and part his hair in the middle with a spirit level . No way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed , for the racers would stop only at the largest towns , and then it would be only 'touch and go . ' Coal flats and wood flats were contracted for beforehand , and these were kept ready to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment's warning . Double crews were carried , so that all work could be quickly done . The chosen date being come , and all things in readiness , the two great steamers back into the stream , and lie there jockeying a moment , and apparently watching each other 's slightest movement , like sentient creatures ; flags drooping , the pent steam shrieking through safety-valves , the black smoke rolling and tumbling from the chimneys and darkening all the air . People , people everywhere ; the shores , the house-tops , the steamboats , the ships , are packed with them , and you know that the borders of the broad Mississippi are going to be fringed with humanity thence northward twelve hundred miles , to welcome these racers . Presently tall columns of steam burst from the 'scape-pipes of both steamers , two guns boom a good-bye , two red-shirted heroes mounted on capstans wave their small flags above the massed crews on the forecastles , two plaintive solos linger on the air a few waiting seconds , two mighty choruses burst forth -- and here they come ! Brass bands bray Hail Columbia , huzza after huzza thunders from the shores , and the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind . Those boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and St. Louis , except for a second or two at large towns , or to hitch thirty-cord wood-boats alongside . You should be on board when they take a couple of those wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of men into each ; by the time you have wiped your glasses and put them on , you will be wondering what has become of that wood . Two nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other day after day . They might even stay side by side , but for the fact that pilots are not all alike , and the smartest pilots will win the race . If one of the boats has a 'lightning ' pilot , whose 'partner ' is a trifle his inferior , you can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground or lost some during each four-hour stretch . The shrewdest pilot can delay a boat if he has not a fine genius for steering . Steering is a very high art . One must not keep a rudder dragging across a boat 's stem if he wants to get up the river fast . There is a great difference in boats , of course . For a long time I was on a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in . But of course this was at rare intervals . Ferryboats used to lose valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died , waiting for us to get by . This was at still rarer intervals . I had the documents for these occurrences , but through carelessness they have been mislaid . This boat , the 'John J. Roe , ' was so slow that when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend , it was five years before the owners heard of it . That was always a confusing fact to me , but it is according to the record , any way . She was dismally slow ; still , we often had pretty exciting times racing with islands , and rafts , and such things . One trip , however , we did rather well . We went to St. Louis in sixteen days . But even at this rattling gait I think we changed watches three times in Fort Adams reach , which is five miles long . A 'reach ' is a piece of straight river , and of course the current drives through such a place in a pretty lively way . That trip we went to Grand Gulf , from New Orleans , in four days ( three hundred and forty miles ) ; the 'Eclipse ' and 'Shotwell ' did it in one . We were nine days out , in the chute of 63 ( seven hundred miles ) ; the 'Eclipse ' and 'Shotwell ' went there in two days . Something over a generation ago , a boat called the ' J . M. White ' went from New Orleans to Cairo in three days , six hours , and forty-four minutes . In 1853 the 'Eclipse ' made the same trip in three days , three hours , and twenty minutes . { footnote [ Time disputed . Some authorities add 1 hour and 16 minutes to this . ] } In 1870 the ' R . E. Lee ' did it in three days and _one_ hour . This last is called the fastest trip on record . I will try to show that it was not . For this reason : the distance between New Orleans and Cairo , when the ' J . M. White ' ran it , was about eleven hundred and six miles ; consequently her average speed was a trifle over fourteen miles per hour . In the 'Eclipse 's ' day the distance between the two ports had become reduced to one thousand and eighty miles ; consequently her average speed was a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles per hour . In the ' R . E. Lee 's ' time the distance had diminished to about one thousand and thirty miles ; consequently her average was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour . Therefore the 'Eclipse 's ' was conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been made . CHAPTER 17 Cut-offs and Stephen THESE dry details are of importance in one particular . They give me an opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi 's oddest peculiarities , -- that of shortening its length from time to time . If you will throw a long , pliant apple-paring over your shoulder , it will pretty fairly shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River ; that is , the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo , Illinois , southward to New Orleans , the same being wonderfully crooked , with a brief straight bit here and there at wide intervals . The two hundred-mile stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no means so crooked , that being a rocky country which the river can not cut much . The water cuts the alluvial banks of the 'lower ' river into deep horseshoe curves ; so deep , indeed , that in some places if you were to get ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck , half or three quarters of a mile , you could sit down and rest a couple of hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow , at a speed of ten miles an hour , to take you aboard again . When the river is rising fast , some scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country , and therefore of inferior value , has only to watch his chance , cut a little gutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night , and turn the water into it , and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has happened : to wit , the whole Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch , and placed the countryman 's plantation on its bank ( quadrupling its value ) , and that other party 's formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on a big island ; the old watercourse around it will soon shoal up , boats can not approach within ten miles of it , and down goes its value to a fourth of its former worth . Watches are kept on those narrow necks , at needful times , and if a man happens to be caught cutting a ditch across them , the chances are all against his ever having another opportunity to cut a ditch . Pray observe some of the effects of this ditching business . Once there was a neck opposite Port Hudson , Louisiana , which was only half a mile across , in its narrowest place . You could walk across there in fifteen minutes ; but if you made the journey around the cape on a raft , you traveled thirty-five miles to accomplish the same thing . In 1722 the river darted through that neck , deserted its old bed , and thus shortened itself thirty-five miles . In the same way it shortened itself twenty-five miles at Black Hawk Point in 1699 . Below Red River Landing , Raccourci cut-off was made ( forty or fifty years ago , I think ) . This shortened the river twenty-eight miles . In our day , if you travel by river from the southernmost of these three cut-offs to the northernmost , you go only seventy miles . To do the same thing a hundred and seventy-six years ago , one had to go a hundred and fifty-eight miles ! -- shortening of eighty-eight miles in that trifling distance . At some forgotten time in the past , cut-offs were made above Vidalia , Louisiana ; at island 92 ; at island 84 ; and at Hale 's Point . These shortened the river , in the aggregate , seventy-seven miles . Since my own day on the Mississippi , cut-offs have been made at Hurricane Island ; at island 100 ; at Napoleon , Arkansas ; at Walnut Bend ; and at Council Bend . These shortened the river , in the aggregate , sixty-seven miles . In my own time a cut-off was made at American Bend , which shortened the river ten miles or more . Therefore , the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve hundred and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy-six years ago . It was eleven hundred and eighty after the cut-off of 1722 . It was one thousand and forty after the American Bend cut-off . It has lost sixty-seven miles since . Consequently its length is only nine hundred and seventy-three miles at present . Now , if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people , and 'let on ' to prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had occurred in a given time in the recent past , or what will occur in the far future by what has occurred in late years , what an opportunity is here ! Geology never had such a chance , nor such exact data to argue from ! Nor 'development of species , ' either ! Glacial epochs are great things , but they are vague -- vague . Please observe : -- In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles . That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year . Therefore , any calm person , who is not blind or idiotic , can see that in the Old Oolitic Silurian Period , ' just a million years ago next November , the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand miles long , and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod . And by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long , and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together , and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen . There is something fascinating about science . One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact . When the water begins to flow through one of those ditches I have been speaking of , it is time for the people thereabouts to move . The water cleaves the banks away like a knife . By the time the ditch has become twelve or fifteen feet wide , the calamity is as good as accomplished , for no power on earth can stop it now . When the width has reached a hundred yards , the banks begin to peel off in slices half an acre wide . The current flowing around the bend traveled formerly only five miles an hour ; now it is tremendously increased by the shortening of the distance . I was on board the first boat that tried to go through the cut-off at American Bend , but we did not get through . It was toward midnight , and a wild night it was -- thunder , lightning , and torrents of rain . It was estimated that the current in the cut-off was making about fifteen or twenty miles an hour ; twelve or thirteen was the best our boat could do , even in tolerably slack water , therefore perhaps we were foolish to try the cut-off . However , Mr. Brown was ambitious , and he kept on trying . The eddy running up the bank , under the 'point , ' was about as swift as the current out in the middle ; so we would go flying up the shore like a lightning express train , get on a big head of steam , and 'stand by for a surge ' when we struck the current that was whirling by the point . But all our preparations were useless . The instant the current hit us it spun us around like a top , the water deluged the forecastle , and the boat careened so far over that one could hardly keep his feet . The next instant we were away down the river , clawing with might and main to keep out of the woods . We tried the experiment four times . I stood on the forecastle companion way to see . It was astonishing to observe how suddenly the boat would spin around and turn tail the moment she emerged from the eddy and the current struck her nose . The sounding concussion and the quivering would have been about the same if she had come full speed against a sand-bank . Under the lightning flashes one could see the plantation cabins and the goodly acres tumble into the river ; and the crash they made was not a bad effort at thunder . Once , when we spun around , we only missed a house about twenty feet , that had a light burning in the window ; and in the same instant that house went overboard . Nobody could stay on our forecastle ; the water swept across it in a torrent every time we plunged athwart the current . At the end of our fourth effort we brought up in the woods two miles below the cut-off ; all the country there was overflowed , of course . A day or two later the cut-off was three-quarters of a mile wide , and boats passed up through it without much difficulty , and so saved ten miles . The old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river 's length twenty-eight miles . There used to be a tradition connected with it . It was said that a boat came along there in the night and went around the enormous elbow the usual way , the pilots not knowing that the cut-off had been made . It was a grisly , hideous night , and all shapes were vague and distorted . The old bend had already begun to fill up , and the boat got to running away from mysterious reefs , and occasionally hitting one . The perplexed pilots fell to swearing , and finally uttered the entirely unnecessary wish that they might never get out of that place . As always happens in such cases , that particular prayer was answered , and the others neglected . So to this day that phantom steamer is still butting around in that deserted river , trying to find her way out . More than one grave watchman has sworn to me that on drizzly , dismal nights , he has glanced fearfully down that forgotten river as he passed the head of the island , and seen the faint glow of the specter steamer 's lights drifting through the distant gloom , and heard the muffled cough of her 'scape-pipes and the plaintive cry of her leadsmen . In the absence of further statistics , I beg to close this chapter with one more reminiscence of 'Stephen . ' Most of the captains and pilots held Stephen 's note for borrowed sums , ranging from two hundred and fifty dollars upward . Stephen never paid one of these notes , but he was very prompt and very zealous about renewing them every twelve months . Of course there came a time , at last , when Stephen could no longer borrow of his ancient creditors ; so he was obliged to lie in wait for new men who did not know him . Such a victim was good-hearted , simple natured young Yates ( I use a fictitious name , but the real name began , as this one does , with a Y ) . Young Yates graduated as a pilot , got a berth , and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk's office and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills , Stephen was there ! His silvery tongue began to wag , and in a very little while Yates 's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands . The fact was soon known at pilot headquarters , and the amusement and satisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous . But innocent Yates never suspected that Stephen 's promise to pay promptly at the end of the week was a worthless one . Yates called for his money at the stipulated time ; Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week . He called then , according to agreement , and came away sugar-coated again , but suffering under another postponement . So the thing went on . Yates haunted Stephen week after week , to no purpose , and at last gave it up . And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates ! Wherever Yates appeared , there was the inevitable Stephen . And not only there , but beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to pay . By and by , whenever poor Yates saw him coming , he would turn and fly , and drag his company with him , if he had company ; but it was of no use ; his debtor would run him down and corner him . Panting and red-faced , Stephen would come , with outstretched hands and eager eyes , invade the conversation , shake both of Yates 's arms loose in their sockets , and begin -- 'My , what a race I 've had ! I saw you did n't see me , and so I clapped on all steam for fear I 'd miss you entirely . And here you are ! there , just stand so , and let me look at you ! just the same old noble countenance . ' [ To Yates 's friend : ] 'Just look at him ! _Look _at him ! Ai n't it just _good _to look at him ! _ain't_ it now ? Ai n't he just a picture ! _Some _call him a picture ; I call him a panorama ! That 's what he is -- an entire panorama . And now I 'm reminded ! How I do wish I could have seen you an hour earlier ! For twenty-four hours I 've been saving up that two hundred and fifty dollars for you ; been looking for you everywhere . I waited at the Planter 's from six yesterday evening till two o'clock this morning , without rest or food ; my wife says , “ Where have you been all night ? ” I said , “ This debt lies heavy on my mind. ” She says , “ In all my days I never saw a man take a debt to heart the way you do. ” I said , “ It 's my nature ; how can I change it ? ” She says , “ Well , do go to bed and get some rest. ” I said , “ Not till that poor , noble young man has got his money. ” So I set up all night , and this morning out I shot , and the first man I struck told me you had shipped on the “ Grand Turk ” and gone to New Orleans . Well , sir , I had to lean up against a building and cry . So help me goodness , I could n't help it . The man that owned the place come out cleaning up with a rag , and said he did n't like to have people cry against his building , and then it seemed to me that the whole world had turned against me , and it was n't any use to live any more ; and coming along an hour ago , suffering no man knows what agony , I met Jim Wilson and paid him the two hundred and fifty dollars on account ; and to think that here you are , now , and I have n't got a cent ! Now , stand so ; let me look at you just once more . ' And so on . Yates 's life became a burden to him . He could not escape his debtor and his debtor 's awful sufferings on account of not being able to pay . He dreaded to show himself in the street , lest he should find Stephen lying in wait for him at the corner . Bogart 's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in those days . They met there about as much to exchange river news as to play . One morning Yates was there ; Stephen was there , too , but kept out of sight . But by and by , when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town , Stephen suddenly appeared in the midst , and rushed for Yates as for a long-lost brother . '_Oh_ , I am so glad to see you ! Oh my soul , the sight of you is such a comfort to my eyes ! Gentlemen , I owe all of you money ; among you I owe probably forty thousand dollars . I want to pay it ; I intend to pay it every last cent of it . You all know , without my telling you , what sorrow it has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such patient and generous friends ; but the sharpest pang I suffer -- by far the sharpest -- is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here ; and I have come to this place this morning especially to make the announcement that I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my debts ! And most especially I wanted _him _to be here when I announced it . Yes , my faithful friend , -- my benefactor , I 've found the method ! I 've found the method to pay off all my debts , and you 'll get your money ! ' Hope dawned in Yates 's eye ; then Stephen , beaming benignantly , and placing his hand upon Yates 's head , added , ' I am going to pay them off in alphabetical order ! ' Then he turned and disappeared . The full significance of Stephen's 'method ' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing crowd for some two minutes ; and then Yates murmured with a sigh -- 'Well , the Y 's stand a gaudy chance . He wo n't get any further than the C 's in _this _world , and I reckon that after a good deal of eternity has wasted away in the next one , I 'll still be referred to up there as “ that poor , ragged pilot that came here from St. Louis in the early days ! ” CHAPTER 18 I Take a Few Extra Lessons DURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship , I served under many pilots , and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and many varieties of steamboats ; for it was not always convenient for Mr. Bixby to have me with him , and in such cases he sent me with somebody else . I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience ; for in that brief , sharp schooling , I got personally and familiarly acquainted with about all the different types of human nature that are to be found in fiction , biography , or history . The fact is daily borne in upon me , that the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years to equip a man with this sort of an education . When I say I am still profiting by this thing , I do not mean that it has constituted me a judge of men -- no , it has not done that ; for judges of men are born , not made . My profit is various in kind and degree ; but the feature of it which I value most is the zest which that early experience has given to my later reading . When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography , I generally take a warm personal interest in him , for the reason that I have known him before -- met him on the river . The figure that comes before me oftenest , out of the shadows of that vanished time , is that of Brown , of the steamer 'Pennsylvania ' -- the man referred to in a former chapter , whose memory was so good and tiresome . He was a middle-aged , long , slim , bony , smooth-shaven , horse-faced , ignorant , stingy , malicious , snarling , fault hunting , mote-magnifying tyrant . I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart . No matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch below , and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft , my soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house . I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man . The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was 'straightening down ; ' I ascended to the pilot-house in high feather , and very proud to be semi-officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous a boat . Brown was at the wheel . I paused in the middle of the room , all fixed to make my bow , but Brown did not look around . I thought he took a furtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye , but as not even this notice was repeated , I judged I had been mistaken . By this time he was picking his way among some dangerous 'breaks ' abreast the woodyards ; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him ; so I stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat . There was silence for ten minutes ; then my new boss turned and inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for about -- as it seemed to me -- a quarter of an hour . After which he removed his countenance and I saw it no more for some seconds ; then it came around once more , and this question greeted me -- 'Are you Horace Bigsby 's cub ? ' 'Yes , sir . ' After this there was a pause and another inspection . Then -- 'What 's your name ? ' I told him . He repeated it after me . It was probably the only thing he ever forgot ; for although I was with him many months he never addressed himself to me in any other way than 'Here ! ' and then his command followed . 'Where was you born ? ' 'In Florida , Missouri . ' A pause . Then -- 'Dern sight better staid there ! ' By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions , he pumped my family history out of me . The leads were going now , in the first crossing . This interrupted the inquest . When the leads had been laid in , he resumed -- 'How long you been on the river ? ' I told him . After a pause -- 'Where 'd you get them shoes ? ' I gave him the information . 'Hold up your foot ! ' I did so . He stepped back , examined the shoe minutely and contemptuously , scratching his head thoughtfully , tilting his high sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation , then ejaculated , 'Well , I 'll be dod derned ! ' and returned to his wheel . What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then . It must have been all of fifteen minutes -- fifteen minutes of dull , homesick silence -- before that long horse-face swung round upon me again -- and then , what a change ! It was as red as fire , and every muscle in it was working . Now came this shriek -- 'Here ! -- You going to set there all day ? ' I lit in the middle of the floor , shot there by the electric suddenness of the surprise . As soon as I could get my voice I said , apologetically : -- ' I have had no orders , sir . ' 'You 've had no _orders_ ! My , what a fine bird we are ! We must have _orders_ ! Our father was a _gentleman_ -- owned slaves -- and we 've been to _school_ . Yes , _we _are a gentleman , _too_ , and got to have _orders ! orders_ , is it ? _Orders _is what you want ! Dod dern my skin , _i'll_ learn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about your dod-derned _orders_ ! G'way from the wheel ! ' ( I had approached it without knowing it . ) I moved back a step or two , and stood as in a dream , all my senses stupefied by this frantic assault . 'What you standing there for ? Take that ice-pitcher down to the texas-tender-come , move along , and do n't you be all day about it ! ' The moment I got back to the pilot-house , Brown said -- 'Here ! What was you doing down there all this time ? ' ' I could n't find the texas-tender ; I had to go all the way to the pantry . ' 'Derned likely story ! Fill up the stove . ' I proceeded to do so . He watched me like a cat . Presently he shouted -- 'Put down that shovel ! Deadest numskull I ever saw -- ai n't even got sense enough to load up a stove . ' All through the watch this sort of thing went on . Yes , and the subsequent watches were much like it , during a stretch of months . As I have said , I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread . The moment I was in the presence , even in the darkest night , I could feel those yellow eyes upon me , and knew their owner was watching for a pretext to spit out some venom on me . Preliminarily he would say -- 'Here ! Take the wheel . ' Two minutes later -- '_Where _in the nation you going to ? Pull her down ! pull her down ! ' After another moment -- 'Say ! You going to hold her all day ? Let her go -- meet her ! meet her ! ' Then he would jump from the bench , snatch the wheel from me , and meet her himself , pouring out wrath upon me all the time . George Ritchie was the other pilot 's cub . He was having good times now ; for his boss , George Ealer , was as kindhearted as Brown was n't . Ritchie had steeled for Brown the season before ; consequently he knew exactly how to entertain himself and plague me , all by the one operation . Whenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer 's watch , Ritchie would sit back on the bench and play Brown , with continual ejaculations of 'Snatch her ! snatch her ! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw ! ' 'Here ! Where you going _now_ ? Going to run over that snag ? ' 'Pull her _down_ ! Do n't you hear me ? Pull her _down ! _ ' 'There she goes ! _Just _as I expected ! I _told_ you not to cramp that reef . G'way from the wheel ! ' So I always had a rough time of it , no matter whose watch it was ; and sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie 's good-natured badgering was pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown 's dead-earnest nagging . I often wanted to kill Brown , but this would not answer . A cub had to take everything his boss gave , in the way of vigorous comment and criticism ; and we all believed that there was a United States law making it a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on duty . However , I could _imagine _myself killing Brown ; there was no law against that ; and that was the thing I used always to do the moment I was abed . Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty , I threw business aside for pleasure , and killed Brown . I killed Brown every night for months ; not in old , stale , commonplace ways , but in new and picturesque ones ; -- ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness of design and ghastliness of situation and environment . Brown was _always _watching for a pretext to find fault ; and if he could find no plausible pretext , he would invent one . He would scold you for shaving a shore , and for not shaving it ; for hugging a bar , and for not hugging it ; for 'pulling down ' when not invited , and for not pulling down when not invited ; for firing up without orders , and for waiting _for_ orders . One day we were approaching New Madrid , bound down and heavily laden . Brown was at one side of the wheel , steering ; I was at the other , standing by to 'pull down ' or 'shove up . ' He cast a furtive glance at me every now and then . I had long ago learned what that meant ; viz. , he was trying to invent a trap for me . I wondered what shape it was going to take . By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual snarly way -- 'Here ! -- See if you 've got gumption enough to round her to . ' This was simply _bound _to be a success ; nothing could prevent it ; for he had never allowed me to round the boat to before ; consequently , no matter how I might do the thing , he could find free fault with it . He stood back there with his greedy eye on me , and the result was what might have been foreseen : I lost my head in a quarter of a minute , and did n't know what I was about ; I started too early to bring the boat around , but detected a green gleam of joy in Brown 's eye , and corrected my mistake ; I started around once more while too high up , but corrected myself again in time ; I made other false moves , and still managed to save myself ; but at last I grew so confused and anxious that I tumbled into the very worst blunder of all -- I got too far down before beginning to fetch the boat around . Brown 's chance was come . His face turned red with passion ; he made one bound , hurled me across the house with a sweep of his arm , spun the wheel down , and began to pour out a stream of vituperation upon me which lasted till he was out of breath . In the course of this speech he called me all the different kinds of hard names he could think of , and once or twice I thought he was even going to swear -- but he did n't this time . 'Dod dern ' was the nearest he ventured to the luxury of swearing , for he had been brought up with a wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone . That was an uncomfortable hour ; for there was a big audience on the hurricane deck . When I went to bed that night , I killed Brown in seventeen different ways -- all of them new . CHAPTER 19 Brown and I Exchange Compliments Two trips later , I got into serious trouble . Brown was steering ; I was 'pulling down . ' My younger brother appeared on the hurricane deck , and shouted to Brown to stop at some landing or other a mile or so below . Brown gave no intimation that he had heard anything . But that was his way : he never condescended to take notice of an under clerk . The wind was blowing ; Brown was deaf ( although he always pretended he was n't ) , and I very much doubted if he had heard the order . If I had two heads , I would have spoken ; but as I had only one , it seemed judicious to take care of it ; so I kept still . Presently , sure enough , we went sailing by that plantation . Captain Klinefelter appeared on the deck , and said -- 'Let her come around , sir , let her come around . Did n't Henry tell you to land here ? ' '_No_ , sir ! ' ' I sent him up to do , it . ' 'He did come up ; and that 's all the good it done , the dod-derned fool . He never said anything . ' 'Did n't _you _hear him ? ' asked the captain of me . Of course I did n't want to be mixed up in this business , but there was no way to avoid it ; so I said -- 'Yes , sir . ' you never heard anything of the kind . ' I closed my mouth according to instructions . An hour later , Henry entered the pilot-house , unaware of what had been going on . He was a thoroughly inoffensive boy , and I was sorry to see him come , for I knew Brown would have no pity on him . Brown began , straightway -- 'Here ! why did n't you tell me we 'd got to land at that plantation ? ' ' I did tell you , Mr . Brown . ' 'It 's a lie ! ' I said -- 'You lie , yourself . He did tell you . ' Brown glared at me in unaffected surprise ; and for as much as a moment he was entirely speechless ; then he shouted to me -- ' I 'll attend to your case in half a minute ! ' then to Henry , 'And you leave the pilot-house ; out with you ! ' It was pilot law , and must be obeyed . The boy started out , and even had his foot on the upper step outside the door , when Brown , with a sudden access of fury , picked up a ten-pound lump of coal and sprang after him ; but I was between , with a heavy stool , and I hit Brown a good honest blow which stretched-him out . I had committed the crime of crimes -- I had lifted my hand against a pilot on duty ! I supposed I was booked for the penitentiary sure , and could n't be booked any surer if I went on and squared my long account with this person while I had the chance ; consequently I stuck to him and pounded him with my fists a considerable time -- I do not know how long , the pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was ; -- but in the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel : a very natural solicitude , for , all this time , here was this steamboat tearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody at the helm ! However , Eagle Bend was two miles wide at this bank-full stage , and correspondingly long and deep ; and the boat was steering herself straight down the middle and taking no chances . Still , that was only luck -- a body _might _have found her charging into the woods . Perceiving , at a glance , that the 'Pennsylvania ' was in no danger , Brown gathered up the big spy-glass , war-club fashion , and ordered me out of the pilot-house with more than Comanche bluster . But I was not afraid of him now ; so , instead of going , I tarried , and criticized his grammar ; I reformed his ferocious speeches for him , and put them into good English , calling his attention to the advantage of pure English over the bastard dialect of the Pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted . He could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere vituperation , of course ; but he was not equipped for this species of controversy ; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the wheel , muttering and shaking his head ; and I retired to the bench . The racket had brought everybody to the hurricane deck , and I trembled when I saw the old captain looking up from the midst of the crowd . I said to myself , 'Now I _am_ done for ! ' -- For although , as a rule , he was so fatherly and indulgent toward the boat 's family , and so patient of minor shortcomings , he could be stern enough when the fault was worth it . I tried to imagine what he _would _do to a cub pilot who had been guilty of such a crime as mine , committed on a boat guard-deep with costly freight and alive with passengers . Our watch was nearly ended . I thought I would go and hide somewhere till I got a chance to slide ashore . So I slipped out of the pilot-house , and down the steps , and around to the texas door -- and was in the act of gliding within , when the captain confronted me ! I dropped my head , and he stood over me in silence a moment or two , then said impressively -- 'Follow me . ' I dropped into his wake ; he led the way to his parlor in the forward end of the texas . We were alone , now . He closed the after door ; then moved slowly to the forward one and closed that . He sat down ; I stood before him . He looked at me some little time , then said -- 'So you have been fighting Mr . Brown ? ' I answered meekly -- 'Yes , sir . ' 'Do you know that that is a very serious matter ? ' 'Yes , sir . ' 'Are you aware that this boat was plowing down the river fully five minutes with no one at the wheel ? ' 'Yes , sir . ' 'Did you strike him first ? ' 'Yes , sir . ' 'What with ? ' ' A stool , sir . ' 'Hard ? ' 'Middling , sir . ' 'Did it knock him down ? ' 'He -- he fell , sir . ' 'Did you follow it up ? Did you do anything further ? ' 'Yes , sir . ' 'What did you do ? ' 'Pounded him , sir . ' 'Pounded him ? ' 'Yes , sir . ' 'Did you pound him much ? -- that is , severely ? ' 'One might call it that , sir , maybe . ' ' I 'm deuced glad of it ! Hark ye , never mention that I said that . You have been guilty of a great crime ; and do n't you ever be guilty of it again , on this boat . _But_ -- lay for him ashore ! Give him a good sound thrashing , do you hear ? I 'll pay the expenses . Now go -- and mind you , not a word of this to anybody . Clear out with you ! -- you 've been guilty of a great crime , you whelp ! ' I slid out , happy with the sense of a close shave and a mighty deliverance ; and I heard him laughing to himself and slapping his fat thighs after I had closed his door . When Brown came off watch he went straight to the captain , who was talking with some passengers on the boiler deck , and demanded that I be put ashore in New Orleans -- and added -- ' I 'll never turn a wheel on this boat again while that cub stays . ' The captain said -- 'But he need n't come round when you are on watch , Mr. Brown . ' I wo n't even stay on the same boat with him . One of us has got to go ashore . ' 'Very well , ' said the captain , 'let it be yourself ; ' and resumed his talk with the passengers . During the brief remainder of the trip , I knew how an emancipated slave feels ; for I was an emancipated slave myself . While we lay at landings , I listened to George Ealer 's flute ; or to his readings from his two bibles , that is to say , Goldsmith and Shakespeare ; or I played chess with him -- and would have beaten him sometimes , only he always took back his last move and ran the game out differently . CHAPTER 20 A Catastrophe WE lay three days in New Orleans , but the captain did not succeed in finding another pilot ; so he proposed that I should stand a daylight watch , and leave the night watches to George Ealer . But I was afraid ; I had never stood a watch of any sort by myself , and I believed I should be sure to get into trouble in the head of some chute , or ground the boat in a near cut through some bar or other . Brown remained in his place ; but he would not travel with me . So the captain gave me an order on the captain of the ' A . T. Lacey , ' for a passage to St. Louis , and said he would find a new pilot there and my steersman 's berth could then be resumed . The 'Lacey ' was to leave a couple of days after the 'Pennsylvania . ' The night before the '_Pennsylvania_ ' left , Henry and I sat chatting on a freight pile on the levee till midnight . The subject of the chat , mainly , was one which I think we had not exploited before -- steamboat disasters . One was then on its way to us , little as we suspected it ; the water which was to make the steam which should cause it , was washing past some point fifteen hundred miles up the river while we talked ; -- but it would arrive at the right time and the right place . We doubted if persons not clothed with authority were of much use in cases of disaster and attendant panic ; still , they might be of _some _use ; so we decided that if a disaster ever fell within our experience we would at least stick to the boat , and give such minor service as chance might throw in the way . Henry remembered this , afterward , when the disaster came , and acted accordingly . The 'Lacey ' started up the river two days behind the 'Pennsylvania . ' We touched at Greenville , Mississippi , a couple of days out , and somebody shouted -- 'The “ Pennsylvania ” is blown up at Ship Island , and a hundred and fifty lives lost ! ' At Napoleon , Arkansas , the same evening , we got an extra , issued by a Memphis paper , which gave some particulars . It mentioned my brother , and said he was not hurt . Further up the river we got a later extra . My brother was again mentioned ; but this time as being hurt beyond help . We did not get full details of the catastrophe until we reached Memphis . This is the sorrowful story -- It was six o'clock on a hot summer morning . The 'Pennsylvania ' was creeping along , north of Ship Island , about sixty miles below Memphis on a half-head of steam , towing a wood-flat which was fast being emptied . George Ealer was in the pilot-house-alone , I think ; the second engineer and a striker had the watch in the engine room ; the second mate had the watch on deck ; George Black , Mr. Wood , and my brother , clerks , were asleep , as were also Brown and the head engineer , the carpenter , the chief mate , and one striker ; Captain Klinefelter was in the barber's chair , and the barber was preparing to shave him . There were a good many cabin passengers aboard , and three or four hundred deck passengers -- so it was said at the time -- and not very many of them were astir . The wood being nearly all out of the flat now , Ealer rang to 'come ahead ' full steam , and the next moment four of the eight boilers exploded with a thunderous crash , and the whole forward third of the boat was hoisted toward the sky ! The main part of the mass , with the chimneys , dropped upon the boat again , a mountain of riddled and chaotic rubbish -- and then , after a little , fire broke out . Many people were flung to considerable distances , and fell in the river ; among these were Mr. Wood and my brother , and the carpenter . The carpenter was still stretched upon his mattress when he struck the water seventy-five feet from the boat . Brown , the pilot , and George Black , chief clerk , were never seen or heard of after the explosion . The barber 's chair , with Captain Klinefelter in it and unhurt , was left with its back overhanging vacancy -- everything forward of it , floor and all , had disappeared ; and the stupefied barber , who was also unhurt , stood with one toe projecting over space , still stirring his lather unconsciously , and saying , not a word . When George Ealer saw the chimneys plunging aloft in front of him , he knew what the matter was ; so he muffled his face in the lapels of his coat , and pressed both hands there tightly to keep this protection in its place so that no steam could get to his nose or mouth . He had ample time to attend to these details while he was going up and returning . He presently landed on top of the unexploded boilers , forty feet below the former pilot-house , accompanied by his wheel and a rain of other stuff , and enveloped in a cloud of scalding steam . All of the many who breathed that steam , died ; none escaped . But Ealer breathed none of it . He made his way to the free air as quickly as he could ; and when the steam cleared away he returned and climbed up on the boilers again , and patiently hunted out each and every one of his chessmen and the several joints of his flute . By this time the fire was beginning to threaten . Shrieks and groans filled the air . A great many persons had been scalded , a great many crippled ; the explosion had driven an iron crowbar through one man's body -- I think they said he was a priest . He did not die at once , and his sufferings were very dreadful . A young French naval cadet , of fifteen , son of a French admiral , was fearfully scalded , but bore his tortures manfully . Both mates were badly scalded , but they stood to their posts , nevertheless . They drew the wood-boat aft , and they and the captain fought back the frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded could be brought there and placed in safety first . When Mr. Wood and Henry fell in the water , they struck out for shore , which was only a few hundred yards away ; but Henry presently said he believed he was not hurt ( what an unaccountable error ! ) , and therefore would swim back to the boat and help save the wounded . So they parted , and Henry returned . By this time the fire was making fierce headway , and several persons who were imprisoned under the ruins were begging piteously for help . All efforts to conquer the fire proved fruitless ; so the buckets were presently thrown aside and the officers fell-to with axes and tried to cut the prisoners out . A striker was one of the captives ; he said he was not injured , but could not free himself ; and when he saw that the fire was likely to drive away the workers , he begged that some one would shoot him , and thus save him from the more dreadful death . The fire did drive the axmen away , and they had to listen , helpless , to this poor fellow 's supplications till the flames ended his miseries . The fire drove all into the wood-flat that could be accommodated there ; it was cut adrift , then , and it and the burning steamer floated down the river toward Ship Island . They moored the flat at the head of the island , and there , unsheltered from the blazing sun , the half-naked occupants had to remain , without food or stimulants , or help for their hurts , during the rest of the day . A steamer came along , finally , and carried the unfortunates to Memphis , and there the most lavish assistance was at once forthcoming . By this time Henry was insensible . The physicians examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal , and naturally turned their main attention to patients who could be saved . Forty of the wounded were placed upon pallets on the floor of a great public hall , and among these was Henry . There the ladies of Memphis came every day , with flowers , fruits , and dainties and delicacies of all kinds , and there they remained and nursed the wounded . All the physicians stood watches there , and all the medical students ; and the rest of the town furnished money , or whatever else was wanted . And Memphis knew how to do all these things well ; for many a disaster like the 'Pennsylvania 's ' had happened near her doors , and she was experienced , above all other cities on the river , in the gracious office of the Good Samaritan . ' The sight I saw when I entered that large hall was new and strange to me . Two long rows of prostrate forms -- more than forty , in all -- and every face and head a shapeless wad of loose raw cotton . It was a gruesome spectacle . I watched there six days and nights , and a very melancholy experience it was . There was one daily incident which was peculiarly depressing : this was the removal of the doomed to a chamber apart . It was done in order that the _morale _of the other patients might not be injuriously affected by seeing one of their number in the death-agony . The fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible , and the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall of assistants ; but no matter : everybody knew what that cluster of bent forms , with its muffled step and its slow movement meant ; and all eyes watched it wistfully , and a shudder went abreast of it like a wave . I saw many poor fellows removed to the 'death-room , ' and saw them no more afterward . But I saw our chief mate carried thither more than once . His hurts were frightful , especially his scalds . He was clothed in linseed oil and raw cotton to his waist , and resembled nothing human . He was often out of his mind ; and then his pains would make him rave and shout and sometimes shriek . Then , after a period of dumb exhaustion , his disordered imagination would suddenly transform the great apartment into a forecastle , and the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew ; and he would come to a sitting posture and shout , 'Hump yourselves , _hump _yourselves , you petrifactions , snail-bellies , pall-bearers ! going to be all _day_ getting that hatful of freight out ? ' and supplement this explosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption or profanity which nothing could stay or stop till his crater was empty . And now and then while these frenzies possessed him , he would tear off handfuls of the cotton and expose his cooked flesh to view . It was horrible . It was bad for the others , of course -- this noise and these exhibitions ; so the doctors tried to give him morphine to quiet him . But , in his mind or out of it , he would not take it . He said his wife had been killed by that treacherous drug , and he would die before he would take it . He suspected that the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary medicines and in his water -- so he ceased from putting either to his lips . Once , when he had been without water during two sweltering days , he took the dipper in his hand , and the sight of the limpid fluid , and the misery of his thirst , tempted him almost beyond his strength ; but he mastered himself and threw it away , and after that he allowed no more to be brought near him . Three times I saw him carried to the death-room , insensible and supposed to be dying ; but each time he revived , cursed his attendants , and demanded to be taken back . He lived to be mate of a steamboat again . But he was the only one who went to the death-room and returned alive . Dr. Peyton , a principal physician , and rich in all the attributes that go to constitute high and flawless character , did all that educated judgment and trained skill could do for Henry ; but , as the newspapers had said in the beginning , his hurts were past help . On the evening of the sixth day his wandering mind busied itself with matters far away , and his nerveless fingers 'picked at his coverlet . ' His hour had struck ; we bore him to the death-room , poor boy . CHAPTER 21 A Section in My Biography IN due course I got my license . I was a pilot now , full fledged . I dropped into casual employments ; no misfortunes resulting , intermittent work gave place to steady and protracted engagements . Time drifted smoothly and prosperously on , and I supposed -- and hoped -- that I was going to follow the river the rest of my days , and die at the wheel when my mission was ended . But by and by the war came , commerce was suspended , my occupation was gone . I had to seek another livelihood . So I became a silver miner in Nevada ; next , a newspaper reporter ; next , a gold miner , in California ; next , a reporter in San Francisco ; next , a special correspondent in the Sandwich Islands ; next , a roving correspondent in Europe and the East ; next , an instructional torch-bearer on the lecture platform ; and , finally , I became a scribbler of books , and an immovable fixture among the other rocks of New England . In so few words have I disposed of the twenty-one slow-drifting years that have come and gone since I last looked from the windows of a pilot-house . Let us resume , now . CHAPTER 22 I Return to My Muttons AFTER twenty-one years ' absence , I felt a very strong desire to see the river again , and the steamboats , and such of the boys as might be left ; so I resolved to go out there . I enlisted a poet for company , and a stenographer to 'take him down , ' and started westward about the middle of April . As I proposed to make notes , with a view to printing , I took some thought as to methods of procedure . I reflected that if I were recognized , on the river , I should not be as free to go and come , talk , inquire , and spy around , as I should be if unknown ; I remembered that it was the custom of steamboatmen in the old times to load up the confiding stranger with the most picturesque and admirable lies , and put the sophisticated friend off with dull and ineffectual facts : so I concluded , that , from a business point of view , it would be an advantage to disguise our party with fictitious names . The idea was certainly good , but it bred infinite bother ; for although Smith , Jones , and Johnson are easy names to remember when there is no occasion to remember them , it is next to impossible to recollect them when they are wanted . How do criminals manage to keep a brand-new _alias _in mind ? This is a great mystery . I was innocent ; and yet was seldom able to lay my hand on my new name when it was needed ; and it seemed to me that if I had had a crime on my conscience to further confuse me , I could never have kept the name by me at all . We left per Pennsylvania Railroad , at 8 A.M. April 18 . 'EVENING . Speaking of dress . Grace and picturesqueness drop gradually out of it as one travels away from New York . ' I find that among my notes . It makes no difference which direction you take , the fact remains the same . Whether you move north , south , east , or west , no matter : you can get up in the morning and guess how far you have come , by noting what degree of grace and picturesqueness is by that time lacking in the costumes of the new passengers , -- I do not mean of the women alone , but of both sexes . It may be that _carriage _is at the bottom of this thing ; and I think it is ; for there are plenty of ladies and gentlemen in the provincial cities whose garments are all made by the best tailors and dressmakers of New York ; yet this has no perceptible effect upon the grand fact : the educated eye never mistakes those people for New-Yorkers . No , there is a godless grace , and snap , and style about a born and bred New-Yorker which mere clothing can not effect . 'APRIL 19 . This morning , struck into the region of full goatees -- sometimes accompanied by a mustache , but only occasionally . ' It was odd to come upon this thick crop of an obsolete and uncomely fashion ; it was like running suddenly across a forgotten acquaintance whom you had supposed dead for a generation . The goatee extends over a wide extent of country ; and is accompanied by an iron-clad belief in Adam and the biblical history of creation , which has not suffered from the assaults of the scientists . 'AFTERNOON . At the railway stations the loafers carry _both _hands in their breeches pockets ; it was observable , heretofore , that one hand was sometimes out of doors , -- here , never . This is an important fact in geography . ' If the loafers determined the character of a country , it would be still more important , of course . 'Heretofore , all along , the station-loafer has been often observed to scratch one shin with the other foot ; here , these remains of activity are wanting . This has an ominous look . ' By and by , we entered the tobacco-chewing region . Fifty years ago , the tobacco-chewing region covered the Union . It is greatly restricted now . Next , boots began to appear . Not in strong force , however . Later -- away down the Mississippi -- they became the rule . They disappeared from other sections of the Union with the mud ; no doubt they will disappear from the river villages , also , when proper pavements come in . We reached St. Louis at ten o'clock at night . At the counter of the hotel I tendered a hurriedly-invented fictitious name , with a miserable attempt at careless ease . The clerk paused , and inspected me in the compassionate way in which one inspects a respectable person who is found in doubtful circumstances ; then he said -- 'It 's all right ; I know what sort of a room you want . Used to clerk at the St. James , in New York . ' An unpromising beginning for a fraudulent career . We started to the supper room , and met two other men whom I had known elsewhere . How odd and unfair it is : wicked impostors go around lecturing under my _Nom De Guerre_ and nobody suspects them ; but when an honest man attempts an imposture , he is exposed at once . One thing seemed plain : we must start down the river the next day , if people who could not be deceived were going to crop up at this rate : an unpalatable disappointment , for we had hoped to have a week in St. Louis . The Southern was a good hotel , and we could have had a comfortable time there . It is large , and well conducted , and its decorations do not make one cry , as do those of the vast Palmer House , in Chicago . True , the billiard-tables were of the Old Silurian Period , and the cues and balls of the Post-Pliocene ; but there was refreshment in this , not discomfort ; for there is rest and healing in the contemplation of antiquities . The most notable absence observable in the billiard-room , was the absence of the river man . If he was there he had taken in his sign , he was in disguise . I saw there none of the swell airs and graces , and ostentatious displays of money , and pompous squanderings of it , which used to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in the bygone days , in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis . In those times , the principal saloons were always populous with river men ; given fifty players present , thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from the river . But I suspected that the ranks were thin now , and the steamboatmen no longer an aristocracy . Why , in my time they used to call the 'barkeep ' Bill , or Joe , or Tom , and slap him on the shoulder ; I watched for that . But none of these people did it . Manifestly a glory that once was had dissolved and vanished away in these twenty-one years . When I went up to my room , I found there the young man called Rogers , crying . Rogers was not his name ; neither was Jones , Brown , Dexter , Ferguson , Bascom , nor Thompson ; but he answered to either of these that a body found handy in an emergency ; or to any other name , in fact , if he perceived that you meant him . He said -- 'What is a person to do here when he wants a drink of water ? -- drink this slush ? ' 'Ca n't you drink it ? ' ' I could if I had some other water to wash it with . ' Here was a thing which had not changed ; a score of years had not affected this water 's mulatto complexion in the least ; a score of centuries would succeed no better , perhaps . It comes out of the turbulent , bank-caving Missouri , and every tumblerful of it holds nearly an acre of land in solution . I got this fact from the bishop of the diocese . If you will let your glass stand half an hour , you can separate the land from the water as easy as Genesis ; and then you will find them both good : the one good to eat , the other good to drink . The land is very nourishing , the water is thoroughly wholesome . The one appeases hunger ; the other , thirst . But the natives do not take them separately , but together , as nature mixed them . When they find an inch of mud in the bottom of a glass , they stir it up , and then take the draught as they would gruel . It is difficult for a stranger to get used to this batter , but once used to it he will prefer it to water . This is really the case . It is good for steamboating , and good to drink ; but it is worthless for all other purposes , except baptizing . Next morning , we drove around town in the rain . The city seemed but little changed . It _was _greatly changed , but it did not seem so ; because in St. Louis , as in London and Pittsburgh , you ca n't persuade a new thing to look new ; the coal smoke turns it into an antiquity the moment you take your hand off it . The place had just about doubled its size , since I was a resident of it , and was now become a city of 400,000 inhabitants ; still , in the solid business parts , it looked about as it had looked formerly . Yet I am sure there is not as much smoke in St. Louis now as there used to be . The smoke used to bank itself in a dense billowy black canopy over the town , and hide the sky from view . This shelter is very much thinner now ; still , there is a sufficiency of smoke there , I think . I heard no complaint . However , on the outskirts changes were apparent enough ; notably in dwelling-house architecture . The fine new homes are noble and beautiful and modern . They stand by themselves , too , with green lawns around them ; whereas the dwellings of a former day are packed together in blocks , and are all of one pattern , with windows all alike , set in an arched frame-work of twisted stone ; a sort of house which was handsome enough when it was rarer . There was another change -- the Forest Park . This was new to me . It is beautiful and very extensive , and has the excellent merit of having been made mainly by nature . There are other parks , and fine ones , notably Tower Grove and the Botanical Gardens ; for St. Louis interested herself in such improvements at an earlier day than did the most of our cities . The first time I ever saw St. Louis , I could have bought it for six million dollars , and it was the mistake of my life that I did not do it . It was bitter now to look abroad over this domed and steepled metropolis , this solid expanse of bricks and mortar stretching away on every hand into dim , measure-defying distances , and remember that I had allowed that opportunity to go by . Why I should have allowed it to go by seems , of course , foolish and inexplicable to-day , at a first glance ; yet there were reasons at the time to justify this course . A Scotchman , Hon . Charles Augustus Murray , writing some forty-five or fifty years ago , said -- 'The streets are narrow , ill paved and ill lighted . ' Those streets are narrow still , of course ; many of them are ill paved yet ; but the reproach of ill lighting can not be repeated , now .

APPENDIX . A B C D THE 'BODY OF THE NATION' BUT the basin of the Mississippi is the _Body of The Nation_ . All the other parts are but members , important in themselves , yet more important in their relations to this . Exclusive of the Lake basin and of 300,000 square miles in Texas and New Mexico , which in many aspects form a part of it , this basin contains about 1,250,000 square miles . In extent it is the second great valley of the world , being exceeded only by that of the Amazon . The valley of the frozen Obi approaches it in extent ; that of La Plata comes next in space , and probably in habitable capacity , having about eight-ninths of its area ; then comes that of the Yenisei , with about seven-ninths ; the Lena , Amoor , Hoang-ho , Yang-tse-kiang , and Nile , five-ninths ; the Ganges , less than one-half ; the Indus , less than one-third ; the Euphrates , one-fifth ; the Rhine , one-fifteenth . It exceeds in extent the whole of Europe , exclusive of Russia , Norway , and Sweden . _It would contain austria four times , germany or spain five times , france six times , the british islands or italy ten times._ Conceptions formed from the river-basins of Western Europe are rudely shocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi ; nor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of Siberia , the lofty plateaus of Central Asia , or the mighty sweep of the swampy Amazon more adequate . Latitude , elevation , and rainfall all combine to render every part of the Mississippi Valley capable of supporting a dense population . _As a dwelling-place for civilized man it is by far the first upon our globe_ . EDITOR 'S TABLE , HARPER 'S MAGAZINE , FEBRUARY 1863 CHAPTER 1 The River and Its History THE Mississippi is well worth reading about . Considering the Missouri its main branch , it is the longest river in the world -- four thousand three hundred miles . It seems safe to say that it is also the crookedest river in the world , since in one part of its journey it uses up one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the crow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five . It discharges three times as much water as the St. Lawrence , twenty-five times as much as the Rhine , and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the Thames . No other river has so vast a drainage-basin : it draws its water supply from twenty-eight States and Territories ; from Delaware , on the Atlantic seaboard , and from all the country between that and Idaho on the Pacific slope -- a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude . The Mississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four subordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats , and from some hundreds that are navigable by flats and keels . The area of its drainage-basin is as great as the combined areas of England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , France , Spain , Portugal , Germany , Austria , Italy , and Turkey ; and almost all this wide region is fertile ; the Mississippi valley , proper , is exceptionally so . From the junction of the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea , the width averages a mile in high water : thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes , until , at the 'Passes , ' above the mouth , it is but little over half a mile . At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi 's depth is eighty-seven feet ; the depth increases gradually , reaching one hundred and twenty-nine just above the mouth . The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez ( three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth ) -- about fifty feet . But at Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet ; at New Orleans only fifteen , and just above the mouth only two and one half . An article in the New Orleans 'Times-Democrat , ' based upon reports of able engineers , states that the river annually empties four hundred and six million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico -- which brings to mind Captain Marryat 's rude name for the Mississippi -- 'the Great Sewer . ' This mud , solidified , would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and forty-one feet high . The mud deposit gradually extends the land -- but only gradually ; it has extended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which have elapsed since the river took its place in history . The belief of the scientific people is , that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge , where the hills cease , and that the two hundred miles of land between there and the Gulf was built by the river . This gives us the age of that piece of country , without any trouble at all -- one hundred and twenty thousand years . Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that lies around there anywhere . More than once it has shortened itself thirty miles at a single jump ! These cut-offs have had curious effects : they have thrown several river towns out into the rural districts , and built up sand bars and forests in front of them . The town of Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg : a recent cutoff has radically changed the position , and Delta is now _two miles above_ Vicksburg . Both of these river towns have been retired to the country by that cut-off . A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions : for instance , a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day , a cut-off occurs to-night , and to-morrow the man finds himself and his land over on the other side of the river , within the boundaries and subject to the laws of the State of Louisiana ! Such a thing , happening in the upper river in the old times , could have transferred a slave from Missouri to Illinois and made a free man of him . The Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone : it is always changing its habitat _bodily_ -- is always moving bodily _sidewise_ . At Hard Times , La. , the river is two miles west of the region it used to occupy . As a result , the original _site _of that settlement is not now in Louisiana at all , but on the other side of the river , in the State of Mississippi . _Nearly the whole of that one thousand three hundred miles of old mississippi river which la salle floated down in his canoes , two hundred years ago , is good solid dry ground now_ . The river lies to the right of it , in places , and to the left of it in other places . Although the Mississippi 's mud builds land but slowly , down at the mouth , where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work , it builds fast enough in better protected regions higher up : for instance , Prophet's Island contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years ago ; since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it . But enough of these examples of the mighty stream 's eccentricities for the present -- I will give a few more of them further along in the book . Let us drop the Mississippi 's physical history , and say a word about its historical history -- so to speak . We can glance briefly at its slumbrous first epoch in a couple of short chapters ; at its second and wider-awake epoch in a couple more ; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good many succeeding chapters ; and then talk about its comparatively tranquil present epoch in what shall be left of the book . The world and the books are so accustomed to use , and over-use , the word 'new ' in connection with our country , that we early get and permanently retain the impression that there is nothing old about it . We do of course know that there are several comparatively old dates in American history , but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea , no distinct realization , of the stretch of time which they represent . It would have been better to paint a picture of it . The date 1542 , standing by itself , means little or nothing to us ; but when one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it , he adds perspective and color , and then realizes that this is one of the American dates which is quite respectable for age . For instance , when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man , less than a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis I . 's defeat at Pavia ; the death of Raphael ; the death of Bayard , _Sans Peur Et Sans Reproche_ ; the driving out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by the Turks ; and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions , -- the act which began the Reformation . When De Soto took his glimpse of the river , Ignatius Loyola was an obscure name ; the order of the Jesuits was not yet a year old ; Michael Angelo 's paint was not yet dry on the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel ; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born , but would be before the year closed . Catherine de Medici was a child ; Elizabeth of England was not yet in her teens ; Calvin , Benvenuto Cellini , and the Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame , and each was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion ; Margaret of Navarre was writing the 'Heptameron ' and some religious books , -- the first survives , the others are forgotten , wit and indelicacy being sometimes better literature preservers than holiness ; lax court morals and the absurd chivalry business were in full feather , and the joust and the tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who could fight better than they could spell , while religion was the passion of their ladies , and classifying their offspring into children of full rank and children by brevet their pastime . In fact , all around , religion was in a peculiarly blooming condition : the Council of Trent was being called ; the Spanish Inquisition was roasting , and racking , and burning , with a free hand ; elsewhere on the continent the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword and fire ; in England , Henry VIII . had suppressed the monasteries , burnt Fisher and another bishop or two , and was getting his English reformation and his harem effectively started . When De Soto stood on the banks of the Mississippi , it was still two years before Luther 's death ; eleven years before the burning of Servetus ; thirty years before the St. Bartholomew slaughter ; Rabelais was not yet published ; 'Don Quixote ' was not yet written ; Shakespeare was not yet born ; a hundred long years must still elapse before Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell . Unquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which considerably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country , and gives her a most respectable outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity . De Soto merely glimpsed the river , then died and was buried in it by his priests and soldiers . One would expect the priests and the soldiers to multiply the river 's dimensions by ten -- the Spanish custom of the day -- and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it . On the contrary , their narratives when they reached home , did not excite that amount of curiosity . The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites during a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days . One may 'sense ' the interval to his mind , after a fashion , by dividing it up in this way : After De Soto glimpsed the river , a fraction short of a quarter of a century elapsed , and then Shakespeare was born ; lived a trifle more than half a century , then died ; and when he had been in his grave considerably more than half a century , the _second _white man saw the Mississippi . In our day we do n't allow a hundred and thirty years to elapse between glimpses of a marvel . If somebody should discover a creek in the county next to the one that the North Pole is in , Europe and America would start fifteen costly expeditions thither : one to explore the creek , and the other fourteen to hunt for each other . For more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements on our Atlantic coasts . These people were in intimate communication with the Indians : in the south the Spaniards were robbing , slaughtering , enslaving and converting them ; higher up , the English were trading beads and blankets to them for a consideration , and throwing in civilization and whiskey , 'for lagniappe ; ' and in Canada the French were schooling them in a rudimentary way , missionarying among them , and drawing whole populations of them at a time to Quebec , and later to Montreal , to buy furs of them . Necessarily , then , these various clusters of whites must have heard of the great river of the far west ; and indeed , they did hear of it vaguely , -- so vaguely and indefinitely , that its course , proportions , and locality were hardly even guessable . The mere mysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled exploration ; but this did not occur . When De Soto found it , he was not hunting for a river , and had no present occasion for one ; consequently he did not value it or even take any particular notice of it . But at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out that river and exploring it . It always happens that when a man seizes upon a neglected and important idea , people inflamed with the same notion crop up all around . It happened so in this instance . Naturally the question suggests itself , Why did these people want the river now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations ? Apparently it was because at this late day they thought they had discovered a way to make it useful ; for it had come to be believed that the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California , and therefore afforded a short cut from Canada to China . Previously the supposition had been that it emptied into the Atlantic , or Sea of Virginia . CHAPTER 2 The River and Its Explorers LA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges , and they were graciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory . Chief among them was the privilege to explore , far and wide , and build forts , and stake out continents , and hand the same over to the king , and pay the expenses himself ; receiving , in return , some little advantages of one sort or another ; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides . He spent several years and about all of his money , in making perilous and painful trips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois , before he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape that he could strike for the Mississippi . And meantime other parties had had better fortune . In 1673 Joliet the merchant , and Marquette the priest , crossed the country and reached the banks of the Mississippi",Life On The Mississippi

INTRODUCTION . Five-and-thirty years ago the glory had not yet departed from the old coach roads : the great roadside inns were still brilliant with well-polished tankards , the smiling glances of pretty barmaids , and the repartees of jocose hostlers ; the mail still announced itself by the merry notes of the horn ; the hedge-cutter or the rick-thatcher might still know the exact hour by the unfailing yet otherwise meteoric apparition of the pea-green Tally-ho or the yellow Independent ; and elderly gentlemen in pony-chaises , quartering nervously to make way for the rolling , swinging swiftness , had not ceased to remark that times were finely changed since they used to see the pack-horses and hear the tinkling of their bells on this very highway . In those days there were pocket boroughs , a Birmingham unrepresented in Parliament and compelled to make strong representations out of it , unrepealed corn-laws , three-and-sixpenny letters , a brawny and many-breeding pauperism , and other departed evils ; but there were some pleasant things , too , which have also departed . _Non omnia grandior ætas quæ fugiamus habet_ , says the wise goddess : you have not the best of it in all things , O youngsters ! the elderly man has his enviable memories , and not the least of them is the memory of a long journey in mid-spring or autumn on the outside of a stage coach . Posterity may be shot , like a bullet through a tube , by atmospheric pressure , from Winchester to Newcastle : that is a fine result to have among our hopes ; but the slow , old fashioned way of getting from one end of our country to the other is the better thing to have in the memory . The tube-journey can never lend much to picture and narrative ; it is as barren as an exclamatory O ! Whereas , the happy outside passenger , seated on the box from the dawn to the gloaming , gathered enough stories of English life , enough of English labors in town and country , enough aspects of earth and sky , to make episodes for a modern Odyssey . Suppose only that his journey took him through that central plain , watered at one extremity by the Avon , at the other by the Trent . As the morning silvered the meadows with their long lines of bushy willows marking the water-courses , or burnished the golden corn-ricks clustered near the long roofs of some midland homestead , he saw the full-uddered cows driven from their pasture to the early milking . Perhaps it was the shepherd , head-servant of the farm , who drove them , his sheep-dog following with a heedless , unofficial air , as of a beadle in undress . The shepherd , with a slow and slouching walk , timed by the walk of grazing beasts , moved aside , as if unwillingly , throwing out a monosyllabic hint to his cattle ; his glance , accustomed to rest on things very near the earth , seemed to lift itself with difficulty to the coachman . Mail or stage coach for him belonged to the mysterious distant system of things called `` Gover'ment , '' which , whatever it might be , was no business of his , any more than the most outlying nebula or the coal-sacks of the southern hemisphere : his solar system was the parish ; the master 's temper and the casualties of lambing-time were his region of storms . He cut his bread and bacon with his pocket-knife , and felt no bitterness except in the matter of pauper laborers and the bad-luck that sent contrarious seasons and the sheep-rot . He and his cows were soon left behind , and the homestead , too , with its pond overhung by elder-trees , its untidy kitchen-garden and cone-shaped yew-tree arbor . But everywhere the bushy hedgerows wasted the land with their straggling beauty , shrouded the grassy borders of the pastures with catkined hazels , and tossed their long blackberry branches on the corn-fields . Perhaps they were white with May , or starred with pale pink dog-roses ; perhaps the urchins were already nutting among them , or gathering the plenteous crabs . It was worth the journey only to see those hedgerows , the liberal homes of unmarketable beauty -- of the purple blossomed , ruby-berried nightshade , of the wild convolvulus climbing and spreading in tendriled strength till it made a great curtain of pale-green hearts and white trumpets , of the many-tubed honey-suckle which , in its most delicate fragrance , hid a charm more subtle and penetrating than beauty . Even if it were winter , the hedgerows showed their coral , the scarlet haws , the deep-crimson hips , with lingering brown leaves to make a resting-place for the jewels of the hoar-frost . Such hedgerows were often as tall as the laborers' cottages dotted along the lanes , or clustered into a small hamlet , their little dingy windows telling , like thick-filmed eyes , of nothing but the darkness within . The passenger on the coach-box , bowled along above such a hamlet , saw chiefly the roofs of it : probably it turned its back on the road , and seemed to lie away from everything but its own patch of earth and sky , away from the parish church by long fields and green lanes , away from all intercourse except that of tramps . If its face could be seen , it was most likely dirty ; but the dirt was Protestant dirt , and the big , bold , gin-breathing tramps were Protestant tramps . There was no sign of superstition near , no crucifix or image to indicate a misguided reverence : the inhabitants were probably so free from superstition that they were in much less awe of the parson than of the overseer . Yet they were saved from the excess of Protestantism by not knowing how to read , and by the absence of handlooms and mines to be the pioneers of Dissent : they were kept safely in the _via media_ of indifference , and could have registered themselves in the census by a big black mark as members of the Church of England . But there were trim cheerful villages too , with a neat or handsome parsonage and gray church set in the midst ; there was the pleasant tinkle of the blacksmith 's anvil , the patient cart horses waiting at his door ; the basket-maker peeling his willow wands in the sunshine ; the wheelwright putting his last touch to a blue cart with red wheels ; here and there a cottage with bright transparent windows showing pots full of blooming balsams or geraniums , and little gardens in front all double daisies or dark wallflowers ; at the well , clean and comely women carrying yoked buckets , and toward the free school small Britons dawdling on , and handling their marbles in the pockets of unpatched corduroys adorned with brass buttons . The land around was rich and marly , great corn-stacks stood in the rick-yards -- for the rick-burners had not found their way hither ; the homesteads were those of rich farmers who paid no rent , or had the rare advantage of a lease , and could afford to keep the corn till prices had risen . The coach would be sure to overtake some of them on their way to their outlying fields or to the market-town , sitting heavily on their well-groomed horses , or weighing down one side of an olive-green gig . They probably thought of the coach with some contempt , as an accommodation for people who had not their own gigs , or who , wanting to travel to London and such distant places , belonged to the trading and less solid part of the nation . The passenger on the box could see that this was the district of protuberant optimists , sure that old England was the best of all possible countries , and that if there were any facts which had not fallen under their own observation , they were facts not worth observing : the district of clean little market-towns without manufactures , of fat livings , an aristocratic clergy , and low poor-rates . But as the day wore on the scene would change : the land would begin to be blackened with coal-pits , the rattle of handlooms to be heard in hamlets and villages . Here were powerful men walking queerly with knees bent outward from squatting in the mine , going home to throw themselves down in their blackened flannel and sleep through the daylight , then rise and spend much of their high wages at the ale-house with their fellows of the Benefit Club ; here the pale eager faces of the handloom-weavers , men and women , haggard from sitting up late at night to finish the week 's work , hardly begun till the Wednesday . Everywhere the cottages and the small children were dirty , for the languid mothers gave their strength to the loom ; pious Dissenting women , perhaps , who took life patiently , and thought that salvation depended chiefly on predestination , and not at all on cleanliness . The gables of Dissenting chapels now made a visible sign of religion , and of a meeting-place to counterbalance the ale-house , even in the hamlets ; but if a couple of old termagants were seen tearing each other 's caps , it was a safe conclusion that , if they had not received the sacraments of the Church , they had not at least given in to schismatic rites , and were free from the errors of Voluntaryism . The breath of the manufacturing town , which made a cloudy day and a red gloom by night on the horizon , diffused itself over all the surrounding country , filling the air with eager unrest . Here was a population not convinced that old England was as good as possible ; here were multitudinous men and women aware that their religion was not exactly the religion of their rulers , who might therefore be better than they were , and who , if better , might alter many things which now made the world perhaps more painful than it need be , and certainly more sinful . Yet there were the gray steeples too , and the churchyards , with their grassy mounds and venerable headstones , sleeping in the sunlight ; there were broad fields and homesteads , and fine old woods covering a rising ground , or stretching far by the roadside , allowing only peeps at the park and mansion which they shut in from the working-day world . In these midland districts the traveller passed rapidly from one phase of English life to another : after looking down on a village dingy with coal-dust , noisy with the shaking of looms , he might skirt a parish all of fields , high hedges , and deep rutted lanes ; after the coach had rattled over the pavement of a manufacturing town , the scenes of riots and trades-union meetings , it would take him in another ten minutes into a rural region , where the neighborhood of the town was only felt in the advantages of a near market for corn , cheese , and hay , and where men with a considerable banking account were accustomed to say that `` they never meddled with politics themselves . '' The busy scenes of the shuttle and the wheel , of the roaring furnace , of the shaft and the pulley , seemed to make but crowded nests in the midst of the large-spaced , slow-moving life of homesteads and far-away cottages and oak-sheltered parks . Looking at the dwellings scattered amongst the woody flats and the plowed uplands , under the low gray sky which overhung them with an unchanging stillness as if Time itself were pausing , it was easy for the traveller to conceive that town and country had no pulse in common , except where the handlooms made a far-reaching straggling fringe about the great centres of manufacture ; that till the agitation about the Catholics in '29 , rural Englishmen had hardly known more of Catholics than of the fossil mammals ; and that their notion of Reform was a confused combination of rick-burners , trades-unions , Nottingham riots , and in general whatever required the calling out of the yeomanry . It was still easier to see that , for the most part , they resisted the rotation of crops and stood by their fallows : and the coachman would perhaps tell how in one parish an innovating farmer , who talked of Sir Humphrey Davy , had been fairly driven out by popular dislike , as if he had been a confounded Radical ; and how , the parson having one Sunday preached from the words , `` Break up your fallow-ground , '' the people thought he had made the text out of his own head , otherwise it would never have come `` so pat '' on a matter of business ; but when they found it in the Bible at home , some said it was an argument for fallows ( else why should the Bible mention fallows ? ) , but a few of the weaker sort were shaken , and thought it was an argument that fallows should be done away with , else the Bible would have said , '' Let your fallows lie '' ; and the next morning the parson had a stroke of apoplexy , which , as coincident with a dispute about fallows , so set the parish against the innovating farmer and the rotation of crops , that he could stand his ground no longer , and transferred his lease . The coachman was an excellent travelling companion and commentator on the landscape : he could tell the names of sites and persons , and explain the meaning of groups , as well as the shade of Virgil in a more memorable journey ; he had as many stories about parishes , and the men and women in them , as the Wanderer in the `` Excursion , '' only his style was different . His view of life had originally been genial , such as became a man who was well warmed within and without , and held a position of easy , undisputed authority ; but the recent initiation of railways had embittered him : he now , as in a perpetual vision , saw the ruined country strewn with shattered limbs , and regarded Mr. Huskisson 's death as a proof of God 's anger against Stephenson . `` Why , every inn on the road would be shut up ! '' and at that word the coachman looked before him with the blank gaze of one who had driven his coach to the outermost edge of the universe , and saw his leaders plunging into the abyss . Still he would soon relapse from the high prophetic strain to the familiar one of narrative . He knew whose the land was wherever he drove ; what noblemen had half-ruined themselves by gambling ; who made handsome returns of rent ; and who was at daggers-drawn with his eldest son . He perhaps remembered the fathers of actual baronets , and knew stories of their extravagant or stingy housekeeping ; whom they had married , whom they had horsewhipped , whether they were particular about preserving their game , and whether they had had much to do with canal companies . About any actual landed proprietor he could also tell whether he was a Reformer or an Anti-Reformer . That was a distinction which had `` turned up '' in latter times , and along with it the paradox , very puzzling to the coachman's mind , that there were men of old family and large estate who voted for the Bill . He did not grapple with the paradox ; he let it pass , with all the discreetness of an experienced theologian or learned scholiast , preferring to point his whip at some object which could raise no questions . No such paradox troubled our coachman when , leaving the town of Treby Magna behind him , he drove between the hedges for a mile or so , crossed the queer long bridge over the river Lapp , and then put his horses to a swift gallop up the hill by the low-nestled village of Little Treby , till they were on the fine level road , skirted on one side by grand larches , oaks , and wych elms , which sometimes opened so far as to let the traveller see that there was a park behind them . How many times in the year , as the coach rolled past the neglected-looking lodges which interrupted the screen of trees , and showed the river winding through a finely-timbered park , had the coachman answered the same questions , or told the same things without being questioned ! That ? -- oh , that was Transome Court , a place there had been a fine sight of lawsuits about . Generations back , the heir of the Transome name had somehow bargained away the estate , and it fell to the Durfeys , very distant connections , who only called themselves Transomes because they had got the estate . But the Durfeys ' claim had been disputed over and over again ; and the coachman , if he had been asked , would have said , though he might have to fall down dead the next minute , that property did n't always get into the right hands . However , the lawyers had found their luck in it ; and people who inherited estates that were lawed about often lived in them as poorly as a mouse in a hollow cheese ; and , by what he could make out , that had been the way with these present Durfeys , or Transomes , as they called themselves . As for Mr. Transome , he was as poor , half-witted a fellow as you 'd wish to see ; but _she_ was master , had come of a high family , and had a spirit -- you might see it in her eye and the way she sat her horse . Forty years ago , when she came into this country , they said she was a pictur ' ; but her family was poor , and so she took up with a hatchet-faced fellow like this Transome . And the eldest son had been just such another as his father , only worse -- a wild sort of half-natural , who got into bad company . They said his mother hated him and wished him dead ; for she'd got another son , quite of a different cut , who had gone to foreign parts when he was a youngster , and she wanted her favorite to be heir . But heir or no heir , Lawyer Jermyn had had _his_ picking out of the estate . Not a door in his big house but what was the finest polished oak , all got off the Transome estate . If anybody liked to believe he paid for it , they were welcome . However , Lawyer Jermyn had sat on that box-seat many and many a time . He had made the wills of most people thereabout . The coachman would not say that Lawyer Jermyn was not the man he would choose to make his own will some day . It was not so well for a lawyer to be over-honest , else he might not be up to other people 's tricks . And as for the Transome business , there had been ins and outs in time gone by , so that you could n't look into it straight backward . At this Mr. Sampson ( everybody in North Loamshire knew Sampson 's coach ) would screw his features into a grimace expressive of entire neutrality , and appear to aim his whip at a particular spot on the horse 's flank . If the passenger was curious for further knowledge concerning the Transome affairs , Sampson would shake his head and say there had been fine stories in his time ; but he never condescended to state what the stories were . Some attributed this reticence to a wise incredulity , others to a want of memory , others to simple ignorance . But at least Sampson was right in saying that there had been fine stories -- meaning , ironically , stories not altogether creditable to the parties concerned . And such stories often come to be fine in a sense that is not ironical . For there is seldom any wrong-doing which does not carry along with it some downfall of blindly-climbing hopes , some hard entail of suffering , some quickly-satiated desire that survives , with the life in death of old paralytic vice , to see itself cursed by its woeful progeny -- some tragic mark of kinship in the one brief life to the far-stretching life that went before , and to the life that is to come after , such as has raised the pity and terror of men ever since they began to discern between will and destiny . But these things are often unknown to the world ; for there is much pain that is quite noiseless ; and vibrations that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying existence . There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder ; robberies that leave man or woman forever beggared of peace and joy , yet kept secret by the sufferer -- committed to no sound except that of low moans in the night , seen in no writing except that made on the face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears . Many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into no human ear . The poets have told us of a dolorous enchanted forest in the under world . The thorn-bushes there , and the thick-barked stems , have human histories hidden in them ; the power of unuttered cries dwells in the passionless-seeming branches , and the red warm blood is darkly feeding the quivering nerves of a sleepless memory that watches through all dreams . These things are a parable . CHAPTER I . He left me when the down upon his lip Lay like the shadow of a hovering kiss . `` Beautiful mother , do not grieve , '' he said ; `` I will be great , and build our fortunes high . And you shall wear the longest train at court , And look so queenly , all the lords shall say , 'She is a royal changeling : there is some crown Lacks the right head , since hers wears naught but braids . ' '' O , he is coming now -- but I am gray : And he -- -- On the first of September , in the memorable year 1832 , some one was expected at Transome Court . As early as two o'clock in the afternoon the aged lodge-keeper had opened the heavy gate , green as the tree trunks were green with nature 's powdery paint , deposited year after year . Already in the village of Little Treby , which lay on the side of a steep hill not far off the lodge-gates , the elder matrons sat in their best gowns at the few cottage doors bordering the road , that they might be ready to get up and make their courtesy when a travelling carriage should come in sight ; and beyond the village several small boys were stationed on the look-out , intending to run a race to the barn-like old church , where the sexton waited in the belfry ready to set the one bell in joyful agitation just at the right moment . The old lodge-keeper had opened the gate and left it in the charge of his lame wife , because he was wanted at the Court to sweep away the leaves , and perhaps to help in the stables . For though Transome Court was a large mansion , built in the fashion of Queen Anne 's time , with a park and grounds as fine as any to be seen in Loamshire , there were very few servants about it . Especially , it seemed , there must be a lack of gardeners ; for , except on the terrace surrounded with a stone parapet in front of the house , where there was a parterre , kept with some neatness , grass had spread itself over the gravel walks , and over all the low mounds once carefully cut as black beds for the shrubs and larger plants . Many of the windows had the shutters closed , and under the grand Scotch fir that stooped toward one corner , the brown fir-needles of many years lay in a small stone balcony in front of two such darkened windows . All round , both near and far , there were grand trees , motionless in the still sunshine , and , like all large motionless things , seemed to add to the stillness . Here and there a leaf fluttered down ; petals fell in a silent shower ; a heavy moth fluttered by , and , when it settled , seemed to fall wearily ; the tiny birds alighted on the walks , and hopped about in perfect tranquillity ; even a stray rabbit sat nibbling a leaf that was to its liking , in the middle of a grassy space , with an air that seemed quite impudent in so timid a creature . No sound was to be heard louder than a sleepy hum , and the soft monotony of running water hurrying on to the river that divided the park . Standing on the south or east side of the house , you would never have guessed that an arrival was expected . But on the west side , where the carriage entrance was , the gates under the stone archway were thrown open ; and so was the double door of the entrance-hall , letting in the warm light on the scagliola pillars , the marble statues , and the broad stone staircase , with its matting worn into large holes . And , stronger sign of expectation than all , from one of the doors that surrounded the entrance-hall , there came forth from time to time a lady , who walked lightly over the polished stone floor , and stood on the door-steps and watched and listened . She walked lightly , for her figure was slim and finely formed , though she was between fifty and sixty . She was a tall , proud-looking woman , with abundant gray hair , dark eyes and eyebrows , and a somewhat eagle-like yet not unfeminine face . Her tight-fitting black dress was much worn ; the fine lace of her cuffs and collar , and of the small veil that fell backward over her high comb , was visibly mended ; but rare jewels flashed on her hands , which lay on her folded black-clad arms like finely-cut onyx cameos . Meantime Mrs. Transome went to the door-steps , watching and listening in vain . Each time she returned to the same room ; it was a moderate-sized comfortable room , with low ebony bookshelves round it , and it formed an ante-room to a large library , of which a glimpse could be seen through an open doorway , partly obstructed by a heavy tapestry curtain drawn on one side . There was a great deal of tarnished gilding and dinginess on the walls and furniture of this smaller room , but the pictures above the bookcases were all of a cheerful kind : portraits in pastel of pearly-skinned ladies with hair-powder , blue ribbons , and low bodices ; a splendid portrait in oils of a Transome in the gorgeous dress of the Restoration ; another of a Transome in his boyhood , with his hand on the neck of a small pony ; and a large Flemish battle-piece , where war seemed only a picturesque blue-and-red accident in a vast sunny expanse of plain and sky . Probably such cheerful pictures had been chosen because this was Mrs. Transome 's usual sitting-room : it was certainly for this reason that , near the chair in which she seated herself each time she re-entered , there hung a picture of a youthful face which bore a strong resemblance to her own : a beardless but masculine face , with rich brown hair hanging low on the forehead , and undulating beside each cheek down to the loose white cravat . Near this same chair were her writing table , with vellum-covered account-books on it , the cabinet in which she kept her neatly-arranged drugs , her basket for her embroidery , a folio volume of architectural engravings from which she took her embroidery-patterns , a number of the `` North Loamshire Herald , '' and the cushion for her fat Blenheim , which was too old and sleepy to notice its mistress's restlessness . For , just now , Mrs. Transome could not abridge the sunny tedium of the day by the feeble interest of her usual indoor occupations . Her consciousness was absorbed by memories and prospects , and except that she walked to the entrance-door to look out , she sat motionless with folded arms , involuntarily from time to time turning toward the portrait close by her , and as often , when its young brown eyes met hers , turning away again with self-checking resolution . At last , prompted by some sudden thought or by some sound , she rose and went hastily beyond the tapestry curtain into the library . She paused near the door without speaking : apparently she only wished to see that no harm was being done . A man nearer seventy than sixty was in the act of ranging on a large library-table a series of shallow drawers , some of them containing dried insects , others mineralogical specimens . His pale mild eyes , receding lower jaw , and slight frame , could never have expressed much vigor , either bodily or mental ; but he had now the unevenness of gait and feebleness of gesture which tell of a past paralytic seizure . His threadbare clothes were thoroughly brushed : his soft white hair was carefully parted and arranged : he was not a neglected-looking old man ; and at his side a fine black retriever , also old , sat on its haunches , and watched him as he went to and fro . But when Mrs. Transome appeared within the doorway , her husband paused in his work and shrank like a timid animal looked at in a cage where flight was impossible . He was conscious of a troublesome intention , for which he had been rebuked before -- that of disturbing all his specimens with a view to a new arrangement . After an interval , in which his wife stood perfectly still , observing him , he began to put back the drawers in their places in the row of cabinets which extended under the bookshelves at one end of the library . When they were all put back and closed , Mrs. Transome turned away , and the frightened old man seated himself with Nimrod the retriever on an ottoman . Peeping at him again , a few minutes after , she saw that he had his arm round Nimrod 's neck , and was uttering his thoughts to the dog in a loud whisper , as little children do to any object near them when they believe themselves unwatched . At last the sound of the church-bell reached Mrs. Transome 's ear , and she knew that before long the sound of wheels must be within hearing ; but she did not at once start up and walk to the entrance-door . She sat still , quivering and listening ; her lips became pale , her hands were cold and trembling . Was her son really coming ? She was far beyond fifty ; and since her early gladness in this best-loved boy , the harvest of her life had been scanty . Could it be that now -- when her hair was gray , when sight had become one of the day 's fatigues , when her young accomplishments seemed almost ludicrous , like the tone of her first harpsichord and the words of the song long browned with age -- she was going to reap an assured joy ? to feel that the doubtful deeds of her life were justified by the result , since a kind Providence had sanctioned them ? -- to be no longer tacitly pitied by her neighbors for her lack of money , her imbecile husband , her graceless eldest-born , and the loneliness of her life ; but to have at her side a rich , clever , possibly a tender , son ? Yes ; but there were the fifteen years of separation , and all that had happened in that long time to throw her into the background of her son 's memory and affection . And yet -- did not men sometimes become more filial in their feeling when experience had mellowed them , and they had themselves become fathers ? Still , if Mrs. Transome had expected only her son , she would have trembled less ; she expected a little grandson also : and there were reasons why she had not been enraptured when her son had written to her only when he was on the eve of returning that he already had an heir born to him . But the facts must be accepted as they stood , and , after all , the chief thing was to have her son back again . Such pride , such affection , such hopes as she cherished in this fifty-sixth year of her life , must find their gratification in him -- or nowhere . Once more she glanced at the portrait . The young brown eyes seemed to dwell on her pleasantly ; but , turning from it with a sort of impatience , and saying aloud , `` Of course he will be altered ! '' she rose almost with difficulty , and walked more slowly than before across the hall to the entrance-door . Already the sound of wheels was loud upon the gravel . The momentary surprise of seeing that it was only a post-chaise , without a servant or much luggage , that was passing under the stone archway and then wheeling round against the flight of stone steps , was at once merged in the sense that there was a dark face under a red travelling-cap looking at her from the window . She saw nothing else ; she was not even conscious that the small group of her own servants had mustered , or that old Hickes the butler had come forward to open the chaise door . She heard herself called `` Mother ! '' and felt a light kiss on each cheek ; but stronger than all that sensation was the consciousness which no previous thought could prepare her for , that this son who had come back to her was a stranger . Three minutes before , she had fancied that , in spite of all changes wrought by fifteen years of separation , she should clasp her son again as she had done at their parting ; but in the moment when their eyes met , the sense of strangeness came upon her like a terror . It was not hard to understand that she was agitated , and the son led her across the hall to the sitting-room , closing the door behind them . Then he turned toward her and said , smiling -- '' You would not have known me , eh , mother ? '' It was perhaps the truth . If she had seen him in a crowd , she might have looked at him without recognition -- not , however , without startled wonder ; for though the likeness to herself was no longer striking , the years had overlaid it with another likeness which would have arrested her . Before she answered him , his eyes , with a keen restlessness , as unlike as possible to the lingering gaze of the portrait , had travelled quickly over the room , alighting on her as she said -- '' Everything is changed , Harold . I am an old woman , you see . '' `` But straighter and more upright than some of the young ones ! '' said Harold ; inwardly , however , feeling that age had made his mother 's face very anxious and eager . `` The old women at Smyrna are like sacks . You've not got clumsy and shapeless . How is it I have the trick of getting fat ? '' ( Here Harold lifted his arm and spread out his plump hand . ) `` I remember my father was as thin as a herring . How is my father ? Where is he ? '' Mrs. Transome just pointed to the curtained doorway , and let her son pass through it alone . She was not given to tears : but now , under the pressure of emotion that could find no other vent , they burst forth . She took care that they should be silent tears , and before Harold came out of the library again they were dried . Mrs. Transome had not the feminine tendency to seek influence through pathos ; she had been used to rule in virtue of acknowledged superiority . The consciousness that she had to make her son 's acquaintance , and that her knowledge of the youth of nineteen might help her little in interpreting the man of thirty-four , had fallen like lead on her soul ; but in this new acquaintance of theirs she cared especially that her son , who had seen a strange world , should feel that he was come home to a mother who was to be consulted on all things , and who could supply his lack of the local experience necessary to an English landholder . Her part in life had been that of the clever sinner , and she was equipped with the views , the reasons , and the habits which belonged to that character ; life would have little meaning for her if she were to be gently thrust aside as a harmless elderly woman . And besides , there were secrets which her son must never know . So , by the time Harold came from the library again , the traces of tears were not discernible , except to a very careful observer . And he did not observe his mother carefully ; his eyes only glanced at her on their way to the _North Loamshire Herald_ , lying on the table near her , which he took up with his left hand , as he said -- '' Gad ! what a wreck poor father is ! Paralysis , eh ? Terribly shrunk and shaken -- crawls about among his books and beetles as usual , though . Well , it 's a slow and easy death . But he 's not much over sixty-five , is he ? '' `` Sixty-seven , counting by birthdays ; but your father was born old , I think , '' said Mrs. Transome , a little flushed with the determination not to show any unasked for feeling . Her son did not notice her . All the time he had been speaking his eyes had been running down the columns of the newspaper . `` But your little boy , Harold -- where is he ? How is it he has not come with you ? '' `` Oh , I left him behind , in town , '' said Harold , still looking at the paper . `` My man Dominic will bring him , with the rest of the luggage . Ah , I see it is young Debarry , and not my old friend Sir Maximus , who is offering himself as candidate for North Loamshire . '' `` Yes . You did not answer me when I wrote to you to London about your standing . There is no other Tory candidate spoken of , and you would have all the Debarry interest . '' `` I hardly think that , '' said Harold , significantly . `` Why ? Jermyn says a Tory candidate can never be got in without it . '' `` But I shall not be a Tory candidate . '' Mrs. Transome felt something like an electric shock . `` What then ? '' she said , almost sharply . `` You will not call yourself a Whig ? '' `` God forbid ! I 'm a Radical . '' Mrs. Transome 's limbs tottered ; she sank into a chair . Here was a distinct confirmation of the vague but strong feeling that her son was a stranger to her . Here was a revelation to which it seemed almost as impossible to adjust her hopes and notions of a dignified life as if her son had said that he had been converted to Mahometanism at Smyrna , and had four wives , instead of one son , shortly to arrive under the care of Dominic . For the moment she had a sickening feeling that it was of no use that the long-delayed good fortune had come at last -- all of no use though the unloved Durfey was dead and buried , and though Harold had come home with plenty of money . There were rich Radicals , she was aware , as there were rich Jews and Dissenters , but she had never thought of them as county people . Sir Francis Burdett had been generally regarded as a madman . It was better to ask no questions , but silently to prepare herself for anything else there might be to come . `` Will you go to your rooms , Harold , and see if there is anything you would like to have altered ? '' `` Yes , let us go , '' said Harold , throwing down the newspaper , in which he had been rapidly reading almost every advertisement while his mother had been going through her sharp inward struggle . `` Uncle Lingon is on the bench still , I see , '' he went on , as he followed her across the hall ; `` is he at home -- will he be here this evening ? '' `` He says you must go to the rectory when you want to see him . You must remember you have come back to a family with old-fashioned notions . Your uncle thought I ought to have you to myself in the first hour or two . He remembered that I had not seen my son for fifteen years . '' `` Ah , by Jove ! fifteen years -- so it is ! '' said Harold , taking his mother's hand and drawing it under his arm ; for he had perceived that her words were charged with an intention . `` And you are as straight as an arrow still ; you will carry the shawls I have brought you as well as ever . '' They walked up the broad stone steps together in silence . Under the shock of discovering her son 's Radicalism , Mrs. Transome had no impulse to say one thing rather than another ; as in a man who had just been branded on the forehead all wonted motives would be uprooted . Harold , on his side , had no wish opposed to filial kindness , but his busy thoughts were determined by habits which had no reference to any woman's feelings ; and even if he could have conceived what his mother 's feeling was , his mind , after that momentary arrest , would have darted forward on its usual course . `` I have given you the south rooms , Harold , '' said Mrs. Transome , as they passed along a corridor lit from above and lined with old family pictures . `` I thought they would suit you best , as they all open into each other , and this middle one will make a pleasant sitting-room for you . '' `` Gad ! the furniture is in a bad state , '' said Harold , glancing around at the middle room which they had just entered ; `` the moths seem to have got into the carpets and hangings . '' `` I had no choice except moths or tenants who would pay rent , '' said Mrs. Transome . `` We have been too poor to keep servants for uninhabited rooms . '' `` What ! you 've been rather pinched , eh ? '' `` You find us living as we have been living these twelve years . '' `` Ah , you 've had Durfey 's debts as well as the lawsuits -- confound them ! It will make a hole in sixty thousand pounds to pay off the mortgages . However , he 's gone now , poor fellow ; and I suppose I should have spent more in buying an English estate some time or other . I always meant to be an Englishman , and thrash a lord or two who thrashed me at Eton . '' `` I hardly thought you could have meant that , Harold , when I found you had married a foreign wife . '' `` Would you have had me wait for a consumptive lackadaisical Englishwoman , who would have hung all her relations around my neck ? I hate English wives ; they want to give their opinion about everything . They interfere with a man 's life . I shall not marry again . '' Mrs. Transome bit her lip , and turned away to draw up a blind . She would not reply to words which showed how completely any conception of herself and her feelings was excluded from her son 's inward world . As she turned round again she said , `` I suppose you have been used to great luxury ; these rooms look miserable to you , but you can soon make any alterations you like . '' `` Oh , I must have a private sitting-room fitted up for myself down-stairs . And the rest are bedrooms , I suppose , '' he went on , opening a side-door . `` Ah , I can sleep here a night or two . But there 's a bedroom down-stairs , with an ante-room , I remember , that would do for my man Dominic and the little boy . I should like to have that . '' `` Your father has slept there for years . He will be like a distracted insect , and never know where to go , if you alter the track he has to walk in . '' `` That 's a pity . I hate going up-stairs . '' `` There is the steward 's room : it is not used , and might be turned into a bedroom . I ca n't offer you my room , for I sleep up-stairs . '' ( Mrs. Transome 's tongue could be a whip upon occasion , but the lash had not fallen on a sensitive spot . ) `` No ; I 'm determined not to sleep up-stairs . We 'll see about the steward 's room to-morrow , and I dare say I shall find a closet of some sort for Dominic . It 's a nuisance he had to stay behind , for I shall have nobody to cook for me . Ah , there 's the old river I used to fish in . I often thought , when I was at Smyrna , that I would buy a park with a river through it as much like the Lapp as possible . Gad , what fine oaks those are opposite ! Some of them must come down , though . '' `` I 've held every tree sacred on the demesne , as I told you , Harold . I trusted to your getting the estate some time , and releasing it ; and I determined to keep it worth releasing . A park without fine timber is no better than a beauty without teeth and hair . '' `` Bravo , mother ! '' said Harold , putting his hand on her shoulder . `` Ah , you 've had to worry yourself about things that do n't properly belong to a woman -- my father being weakly . We 'll set all that right . You shall have nothing to do now but to be grandmamma on satin cushions . '' `` You must excuse me from the satin cushions . That is a part of the old woman 's duty I am not prepared for . I am used to be chief bailiff , and to sit in the saddle two or three hours every day . There are two farms on our hands besides the Home Farm . '' `` Phew-ew ! Jermyn manages the estate badly , then . That will not last under _my_ reign , '' said Harold , turning on his heel and feeling in his pockets for the keys of his portmanteaus , which had been brought up . `` Perhaps when you 've been in England a little longer , '' said Mrs. Transome , coloring as if she had been a girl , `` you will understand better the difficulty there is in letting farms these times . '' `` I understand the difficulty perfectly , mother . To let farms , a man must have the sense to see what will make them inviting to farmers , and to get sense supplied on demand is just the most difficult transaction I know of . I suppose if I ring there 's some fellow who can act as valet and learn to attend to my hookah ? '' `` There is Hickes the butler , and there is Jabez the footman ; those are all the men in the house . They were here when you left . '' `` Oh , I remember Jabez -- he was a dolt . I 'll have old Hickes . He was a neat little machine of a butler ; his words used to come like the clicks of an engine . He must be an old machine now , though . '' `` You seem to remember some things about home wonderfully well , Harold . '' `` Never forget places and people -- how they look and what can be done with them . All the country round here lies like a map in my brain . A deuced pretty country too ; but the people were a stupid set of old Whigs and Tories . I suppose they are much as they were . '' `` I am , at least , Harold . You are the first of your family that ever talked of being a Radical . I did not think I was taking care of our old oaks for that . I always thought Radicals ' houses stood staring above poor sticks of young trees and iron hurdles . '' `` Yes , but the Radical sticks are growing , mother , and half the Tory oaks are rotting , '' said Harold , with gay carelessness . `` You 've arranged for Jermyn to be early to-morrow ? '' `` He will be here to breakfast at nine . But I leave you to Hickes now ; we dine in an hour . '' Mrs. Transome went away and shut herself in her own dressing-room . It had come to pass now -- this meeting with the son who had been the object of so much longing ; whom she had longed for before he was born , for whom she had sinned , from whom she had wrenched herself with pain at their parting , and whose coming again had been the one great hope of her years . The moment was gone by ; there had been no ecstasy , no gladness even ; hardly half an hour had passed , and few words had been spoken , yet with that quickness in weaving new futures which belongs to women whose actions have kept them in habitual fear of consequences , Mrs. Transome thought she saw with all the clearness of demonstration that her son 's return had not been a good for her in the sense of making her any happier . She stood before a tall mirror , going close to it and looking at her face with hard scrutiny , as if it were unrelated to herself . No elderly face can be handsome , looked at in that way ; every little detail is startlingly prominent , and the effect of the whole is lost . She saw the dried-up complexion , and the deep lines of bitter discontent about the mouth . `` I am a hag ! '' she said to herself ( she was accustomed to give her thoughts a very sharp outline ) , `` an ugly old woman who happens to be his mother . That is what he sees in me , as I see a stranger in him . I shall count for nothing . I was foolish to expect anything else . '' She turned away from the mirror and walked up and down her room . `` What a likeness ! '' she said , in a loud whisper ; `` yet , perhaps , no one will see it besides me . '' She threw herself into a chair , and sat with a fixed look , seeing nothing that was actually present , but inwardly seeing with painful vividness what had been present with her a little more than thirty years ago -- the little round-limbed creature that had been leaning against her knees , and stamping tiny feet , and looking up at her with gurgling laughter . She had thought that the possession of this child would give unity to her life , and make some gladness through the changing years that would grow as fruit out of these early maternal caresses . But nothing had come just as she had wished . The mother 's early raptures had lasted but a short time , and even while they lasted there had grown up in the midst of them a hungry desire , like a black poisonous plant feeding in the sunlight , -- the desire that her first , rickety , ugly , imbecile child should die , and leave room for her darling , of whom she could be proud . Such desires make life a hideous lottery , where everyday may turn up a blank ; where men and women who have the softest beds and the most delicate eating , who have a very large share of that sky and earth which some are born to have no more of than the fraction to be got in a crowded entry , yet grow haggard , fevered , and restless , like those who watch in other lotteries . Day after day , year after year , had yielded blanks ; new cares had come , bringing other desires for results quite beyond her grasp , which must also be watched for in the lottery ; and all the while the round-limbed pet had been growing into a strong youth , who liked many things better than his mother 's caresses , and who had a much keener consciousness of his independent existence than of his relation to her : the lizard 's egg , that white rounded passive prettiness , had become a brown , darting , determined lizard . The mother's love is at first an absorbing delight , blunting all other sensibilities ; it is an expansion of the animal existence ; it enlarges the imagined range for self to move in : but in after years it can only continue to be joy on the same terms as other long-lived love -- that is , by much suppression of self , and power of living in the experience of another . Mrs. Transome had darkly felt the pressure of that unchangeable fact . Yet she had clung to the belief that somehow the possession of this son was the best thing she lived for ; to believe otherwise would have made her memory too ghastly a companion . Some time or other , by some means , the estate she was struggling to save from the grasp of the law would be Harold 's . Somehow the hated Durfey , the imbecile eldest , who seemed to have become tenacious of a despicable squandering life , would be got rid of ; vice might kill him . Meanwhile the estate was burdened : there was no good prospect for any heir . Harold must go and make a career for himself and this was what he was bent on , with a precocious clearness of perception as to the conditions on which he could hope for any advantages in life . Like most energetic natures , he had a strong faith in his luck ; he had been gay at their parting , and had promised to make his fortune ; and in spite of past disappointments , Harold 's possible fortune still made some ground for his mother to plant her hopes in . His luck had not failed him ; yet nothing had turned out according to her expectations . Her life had been like a spoiled shabby pleasure-day , in which the music and the processions are all missed , and nothing is left at evening but the weariness of striving after what has been failed of . Harold had gone with the Embassy to Constantinople , under the patronage of a high relative , his mother 's cousin ; he was to be diplomatist , and work his way upward in public life . But his luck had taken another shape : he had saved the life of an Armenian banker , who in gratitude had offered him a prospect which his practical mind had preferred to the problematic promises of diplomacy and high-born cousinship . Harold had become a merchant and banker at Smyrna ; and let the years pass without caring to find the possibility of visiting his early home , and had shown no eagerness to make his life at all familiar to his mother , asking for letters about England , but writing scantily about himself . Mrs. Transome had kept up the habit of writing to her son , but gradually the unfruitful years had dulled her hopes and yearnings ; increasing anxieties about money had worried her , and she was more sure of being fretted by bad news about her dissolute eldest son than of hearing anything to cheer her from Harold . She had begun to live merely in small immediate cares and occupations , and like all eager-minded women who advance in life without any activity of tenderness or any large sympathy , she had contracted small rigid habits of thinking and acting , she had her `` ways '' which must not be crossed , and had learned to fill up the great void of life with giving small orders to tenants , insisting on medicines for infirm cottagers , winning small triumphs in bargains and personal economies , and parrying ill-natured remarks of Lady Debarry's by lancet-edged epigrams . So her life had gone on till more than a year ago , when that desire which had been so hungry when she was a blooming young mother , was at last fulfilled -- at last , when her hair was gray , and her face looked bitter , restless , and unenjoying , like her life . The news came from Jersey that Durfey , the imbecile son , was dead . _Now_ Harold was heir to the estate ; now the wealth he had gained could release the land from its burdens ; now he would think it worth while to return home . A change had come over her life , and the sunlight breaking the clouds at evening was pleasant , though the sun must sink before long . Hopes , affections , the sweeter part of her memories , started from their wintry sleep , and it once more seemed a great good to have had a second son who in some ways had cost her dearly . But again there were conditions she had not reckoned on . When the good tidings had been sent to Harold , and he had announced that he would return so soon as he could wind up his affairs , he had for the first time informed his mother that he had been married , that his Greek wife was no longer living , but that he should bring home a little boy , the finest and most desirable of heirs and grandsons . Harold seated in his distant Smyrna home considered that he was taking a rational view of what things must have become by this time at the old place in England , when he figured his mother as a good elderly lady , who would necessarily be delighted with the possession on any terms of a healthy grandchild , and would not mind much about the particulars of a long-concealed marriage . Mrs. Transome had torn up that letter in a rage . But in the months which had elapsed before Harold could actually arrive , she had prepared herself as well as she could to suppress all reproaches or queries which her son might resent , and to acquiesce in his evident wishes . The return was still looked for with longing ; affection and satisfied pride would again warm her later years . She was ignorant what sort of man Harold had become now , and of course he must be changed in many ways ; but though she told herself this , still the image that she knew , the image fondness clung to , necessarily prevailed over the negatives insisted on by her reason . And so it was , that when she had moved to the door to meet him , she had been sure that she should clasp her son again , and feel that he was the same who had been her boy , her little one , the loved child of her passionate youth . An hour seemed to have changed everything for her . A woman 's hopes are woven of sunbeams ; a shadow annihilates them . The shadow which had fallen over Mrs. Transome in this first interview with her son was the presentiment of her powerlessness . If things went wrong , if Harold got unpleasantly disposed in a certain direction where her chief dread had always lain , she seemed to foresee that her words would be of no avail . The keenness of her anxiety in this matter had served as insight ; and Harold 's rapidity , decision , and indifference to any impressions in others , which did not further or impede his own purposes , had made themselves felt by her as much as she would have felt the unmanageable strength of a great bird which had alighted near her , and allowed her to stroke its wing for a moment because food lay near her . Under the cold weight of these thoughts Mrs. Transome shivered . That physical reaction roused her from her reverie , and she could now hear the gentle knocking at the door to which she had been deaf before . Notwithstanding her activity and the fewness of her servants , she had never dressed herself without aid ; nor would that small , neat , exquisitely clean old woman who now presented herself have wished that her labor should be saved at the expense of such a sacrifice on her lady 's part . The small old woman was Mrs. Hickes , the butler 's wife , who acted as housekeeper , lady's-maid , and superintendent of the kitchen -- the large stony scene of inconsiderable cooking . Forty years ago she had entered Mrs. Transome 's service , when that lady was beautiful Miss Lingon , and her mistress still called her Denner , as she had done in the old days . `` The bell has rung , then , Denner , without my hearing it ? '' said Mrs. Transome , rising . `` Yes , madam , '' said Denner , reaching from a wardrobe an old black velvet dress trimmed with much-mended point , in which Mrs. Transome was wont to look queenly of an evening . Denner had still strong eyes of that short-sighted kind which sees through the narrowest chink between the eyelashes . The physical contrast between the tall , eagle-faced , dark-eyed lady , and the little peering waiting woman , who had been round-featured and of pale mealy complexion from her youth up , had doubtless had a strong influence in determining Denner 's feeling toward her mistress , which was of that worshipful sort paid to a goddess in ages when it was not thought necessary or likely that a goddess should be very moral . There were different orders of beings -- so ran Denner 's creed -- and she belonged to another order than that to which her mistress belonged . She had a mind as sharp as a needle , and would have seen through and through the ridiculous pretensions of a born servant who did not submissively accept the rigid fate which had given her born superiors . She would have called such pretensions the wrigglings of a worm that tried to walk on its tail . There was a tacit understanding that Denner knew all her mistress's secrets , and her speech was plain and unflattering ; yet with wonderful subtlety of instinct she never said anything which Mrs. Transome could feel humiliated by , as by familiarity from a servant who knew too much . Denner identified her own dignity with that of her mistress . She was a hard-headed godless little woman , but with a character to be reckoned on as you reckon on the qualities of iron . Peering into Mrs. Transome 's face she saw clearly that the meeting with the son had been a disappointment in some way . She spoke with a refined accent , in a low quick , monotonous tone -- '' Mr. Harold is dressed ; he shook me by the hand in the corridor , and was very pleasant . '' `` What an alteration , Denner ! No likeness to me now . '' `` Handsome , though , spite of his being so browned and stout . There 's a fine presence about Mr. Harold . I remember you used to say , madam , there were some people you would always know were in the room though they stood round a corner , and others you might never see till you ran against them . That 's as true as truth . And as for likenesses , thirty-five and sixty are not much alike , only to people 's memories . '' Mrs. Transome knew perfectly that Denner had divined her thoughts . `` I do n't know how things will go on now , but it seems something too good to happen that they will go on well . I am afraid of ever expecting anything good again . '' `` That 's weakness , madam . Things do n't happen because they 're bad or good , else all eggs would be addled or none at all , and at the most it is but six to the dozen . There 's good chances and bad chances , and nobody 's luck is pulled only by one string . '' `` What a woman you are , Denner ! You talk like a French infidel . It seems to me you are afraid of nothing . I have been full of fears all my life -- always seeing something or other hanging over me that I couldn't bear to happen . '' `` Well , madam , put a good face on it , and do n't seem to be on the look-out for crows , else you 'll set other people watching . Here you have a rich son come home , and the debts will all be paid , and you have your health and can ride about , and you 've such a face and figure , and will have if you live to be eighty , that everybody is cap in hand to you before they know you who are ; let me fasten up your veil a little higher : there 's a good deal of pleasure in life for you yet . '' `` Nonsense ! there 's no pleasure for old women , unless they get it out of tormenting other people . What are your pleasures , Denner -- besides being a slave to me ? '' `` Oh , there 's pleasure in knowing one 's not a fool , like half the people one sees about . And managing one 's husband is some pleasure ; and doing all one 's business well . Why , if I 've only got some orange flowers to candy , I should n't like to die till I see them all right . Then there's the sunshine now and then ; I like that as the cats do . I look upon it , life is like our game at whist , when Banks and his wife come to the still-room of an evening . I do n't enjoy the game much , but I like to play my cards well , and see what will be the end of it ; and I want to see you make the best of your hand , madam , for your luck has been mine these forty years now . But I must go and see how Kitty dishes up the dinner , unless you have any more commands . '' `` No , Denner ; I am going down immediately . '' As Mrs. Transome descended the stone staircase in her old black velvet and point , her appearance justified Denner 's personal compliment . She had that high-born , imperious air which would have marked her as an object of hatred and reviling by a revolutionary mob . Her person was too typical of social distinctions to be passed by with indifference by any one : it would have fitted an empress in her own right , who had had to rule in spite of faction , to dare the violation of treaties and dread retributive invasions , to grasp after new territories , to be defiant in desperate circumstances , and to feel a woman 's hunger of the heart forever unsatisfied . Yet Mrs. Transome 's cares and occupations had not been at all of an imperial sort . For thirty years she had led the monotonous , narrowing life which used to be the lot of our poorer gentry ; who never went to town , and were probably not on speaking terms with two out of the five families whose parks lay within the distance of a drive . When she was young she had been thought wonderfully clever and accomplished , and had been rather ambitious of intellectual superiority -- had secretly picked out for private reading the higher parts of dangerous French authors -- and in company had been able to talk of Mr. Burke 's style , or of Chateaubriand 's eloquence -- had laughed at the Lyrical Ballads , and admired Mr. Southey 's Thalaba . She always thought that the dangerous French writers were wicked and that her reading of them was a sin ; but many sinful things were highly agreeable to her , and many things which she did not doubt to be good and true were dull and meaningless . She found ridicule of Biblical characters very amusing , and she was interested in stories of illicit passion ; but she believed all the while that truth and safety lay in due attendance on prayers and sermons , in the admirable doctrines and ritual of the Church of England , equally remote from Puritanism and Popery ; in fact , in such a view of this world and the next as would preserve the existing arrangements of English society quite unshaken , keeping down the obtrusiveness of the vulgar and the discontent of the poor . The history of the Jews , she knew , ought to be preferred to any profane history ; the Pagans , of course , were vicious , and their religions quite nonsensical , considered as religions -- but classical learning came from the Pagans ; the Greeks were famous for sculpture ; the Italians for painting ; the middle ages were dark and Papistical ; but now Christianity went hand in hand with civilization , and the providential government of the world , though a little confused and entangled in foreign countries , in our favored land was clearly seen to be carried forward on Tory and Church of England principles , sustained by the succession of the House of Brunswick , and by sound English divines . For Miss Lingon had had a superior governess , who held that a woman should be able to write a good letter , and to express herself with propriety on general subjects . And it is astonishing how effective this education appeared in a handsome girl , who sat supremely well on horseback , sang and played a little , painted small figures in water-colors , had a naughty sparkle in her eyes when she made a daring quotation , and an air of serious dignity when she recited something from her store of correct opinions . But however such a stock of ideas may be made to tell in elegant society , and during a few seasons in town , no amount of bloom and beauty can make them a perennial source of interest in things not personal ; and the notion that what is true and , in general , good for mankind , is stupid and drug-like , is not a safe theoretic basis in circumstances of temptation and difficulty . Mrs. Transome had been in her bloom before this century began , and in the long painful years since then , what she had once regarded as her knowledge and accomplishments had become as valueless as old-fashioned stucco ornaments , of which the substance was never worth anything , while the form is no longer to the taste of any living mortal . Crosses , mortifications , money-cares , conscious blame-worthiness , had changed the aspect of the world for her ; there was anxiety in the morning sunlight ; there was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting neighbors ; there was advancing age , and a contracting prospect in the changing seasons as they came and went . And what could then sweeten the days to a hungry , much-exacting self like Mrs. Transome 's ? Under protracted ill every living creature will find something that makes a comparative ease , and even when life seems woven of pain , will convert the fainter pang into a desire . Mrs. Transome , whose imperious will had availed little to ward off the great evils of her life , found the opiate for her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things . She was not cruel , and could not enjoy thoroughly what she called the old woman 's pleasure of tormenting ; but she liked every little sign of power her lot had left her . She liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded below her as she sat on horseback . She liked to insist that work done without her orders should be undone from beginning to end . She liked to be courtesied and bowed to by all the congregation as she walked up the little barn of a church . She liked to change a laborer 's medicine fetched from the doctor , and substitute a prescription of her own . If she had only been more haggard and less majestic , those who had glimpses of her outward life might have said she was a tyrannical , griping harridan , with a tongue like a razor . No one said exactly that ; but they never said anything like the full truth about her , or divined what was hidden under that outward life -- a woman 's keen sensibility and dread , which lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions , as some quivering thing with eyes and throbbing heart may lie crouching behind withered rubbish . The sensibility and dread had palpitated all the faster in the prospect of her son 's return ; and now that she had seen him , she said to herself , in her bitter way , `` It is a lucky eel that escapes skinning . The best happiness I shall ever know , will be to escape the worst misery . '' CHAPTER II . A jolly parson of the good old stock , By birth a gentleman , yet homely too , Suiting his phrase to Hodge and Margery Whom he once christened , and has married since , A little lax in doctrine and in life . Not thinking God was captious in such things As what a man might drink on holidays , But holding true religion was to do As you 'd be done by -- which could never mean That he should preach three sermons in a week . Harold Transome did not choose to spend the whole evening with his mother . It was his habit to compress a great deal of effective conversation into a short space of time , asking rapidly all the questions he wanted to get answered , and diluting no subject with irrelevancies , paraphrase , or repetitions . He volunteered no information about himself and his past life at Smyrna , but answered pleasantly enough , though briefly , whenever his mother asked for any detail . He was evidently ill-satisfied as to his palate , trying red pepper to everything , then asking if there were any relishing sauces in the house , and when Hickes brought various home-filled bottles , trying several , finding them failures , and finally falling back from his plate in despair . Yet he remained good-humored , saying something to his father now and then for the sake of being kind , and looking on with a pitying shrug as he saw him watch Hickes cutting his food . Mrs. Transome thought with some bitterness that Harold showed more feeling for her feeble husband who had never cared in the least about him , than for her , who had given him more than the usual share of mother 's love . An hour after dinner , Harold , who had already been turning over the leaves of his mother 's account-books , said -- '' I shall just cross the park to the parsonage to see my uncle Lingon . '' `` Very well . He can answer more questions for you . '' `` Yes , '' said Harold , quite deaf to the innuendo , and accepting the words as a simple statement of the fact . `` I want to hear all about the game and the North Loamshire hunt . I 'm fond of sport ; we had a great deal of it at Smyrna , and it keeps down my fat . '' The Reverend John Lingon became very talkative over his second bottle of port , which was opened on his nephew 's arrival . He was not curious about the manners of Smyrna , or about Harold 's experience , but he unbosomed himself very freely as to what he himself liked and disliked , which of the farmers he suspected of killing the foxes , what game he had bagged that very morning , what spot he would recommend as a new cover , and the comparative flatness of all existing sport compared with cock-fighting , under which Old England had been prosperous and glorious , while , so far as he could see , it had gained little by the abolition of a practice which sharpened the faculties of men , gratified the instincts of the fowl , and carried out the designs of heaven in its admirable device of spurs . From these main topics , which made his points of departure and return , he rambled easily enough at any new suggestion or query ; so that when Harold got home at a late hour , he was conscious of having gathered from amidst the pompous full-toned triviality of his uncle 's chat some impressions , which were of practical importance . Among the rector's dislikes , it appeared , was Mr. Matthew Jermyn . `` A fat-handed , glib-tongued fellow , with a scented cambric handkerchief ; one of your educated low-bred fellows ; a foundling who got his Latin for nothing at Christ 's Hospital ; one of your middle-class upstarts who want to rank with gentlemen , and think they 'll do it with kid gloves and new furniture . '' But since Harold meant to stand for the county , Mr. Lingon was equally emphatic as to the necessity of his not quarrelling with Jermyn till the election was over . Jermyn must be his agent ; Harold must wink hard till he found himself safely returned ; and even then it might be well to let Jermyn drop gently and raise no scandal . He himself had no quarrel with the fellow : a clergyman should have no quarrels , and he made it a point to be able to take wine with any man he met at table . And as to the estate , and his sister 's going too much by Jermyn 's advice , he never meddled with business : it was not his duty as a clergyman . That , he considered , was the meaning of Melchisedec and the tithe , a subject , into which he had gone to some depth thirty years ago , when he preached the Visitation sermon . The discovery that Harold meant to stand on the Liberal side -- nay , that he boldly declared himself a Radical -- was rather startling ; but to his uncle 's good-humor , beatified by the sipping of port-wine , nothing could seem highly objectionable , provided it did not disturb that operation . In the course of half an hour he had brought himself to see that anything really worthy to be called British Toryism had been entirely extinct since the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel had passed the Catholic Emancipation Bill ; that Whiggery , with its rights of man stopping short at ten-pound householders , and its policy of pacifying a wild beast with a bite , was a ridiculous monstrosity ; that therefore , since an honest man could not call himself a Tory , which it was , in fact , as impossible to be now as to fight for the old Pretender , and could still less become that execrable monstrosity a Whig , there remained but one course open to him . `` Why , lad , if the world was turned into a swamp , I suppose we should leave off shoes and stockings , and walk about like cranes '' -- whence it followed plainly enough that , in these hopeless times , nothing was left to men of sense and good family but to retard the national ruin by declaring themselves Radicals , and take the inevitable process of changing everything out of the hands of beggarly demagogues and purse-proud tradesmen . It is true the rector was helped to this chain of reasoning by Harold 's remarks ; but he soon became quite ardent in asserting the conclusion . `` If the mob ca n't be turned back , a man of family must try and head the mob , and save a few homes and hearths , and keep the country up on its last legs as long as he can . And you 're a man of family , my lad -- dash it ! You 're a Lingon , whatever else you may be , and I 'll stand by you . I 've no great interest ; I 'm a poor parson . I 've been forced to give up hunting ; my pointers and a glass of good wine are the only decencies becoming my station that I can allow myself . But I 'll give you my countenance -- I 'll stick to you as my nephew . There 's no need for me to change sides exactly . I was born a Tory , and I shall never be a bishop . But if anybody says you 're in the wrong , I shall say , 'My nephew is in the right ; he has turned Radical to save his country . If William Pitt had been living now he 'd have done the same ; for what did he say when he was dying ? Not 'Oh , save my party ! ' but 'Oh , save my country , heaven ! ' That was what they dinned in our ears about Peel and the Duke ; and now I 'll turn it round upon them . They shall be hoist with their own petard . Yes , yes , I 'll stand by you . '' Harold did not feel sure that his uncle would thoroughly retain this satisfactory thread of argument in the uninspired hours of the morning ; but the old gentleman was sure to take the facts easily in the end , and there was no fear of family coolness or quarrelling on this side . Harold was glad of it . He was not to be turned aside from any course he had chosen ; but he disliked all quarrelling as an unpleasant expenditure of energy that could have no good practical result . He was at once active and luxurious ; fond of mastery , and good-natured enough to wish that every one about him should like his mastery ; not caring greatly to know other people 's thoughts , and ready to despise them as blockheads if their thoughts differed from his , and yet solicitous that they should have no colorable reason for slight thoughts about _him_ . The blockheads must be forced to respect him . Hence , in proportion as he foresaw his equals in the neighborhood would be indignant with him for his political choice , he cared keenly about making a good figure before them in every other way . His conduct as a landholder was to be judicious , his establishment was to be kept up generously , his imbecile father treated with careful regard , his family relations entirely without scandal . He knew that affairs had been unpleasant in his youth -- that there had been ugly lawsuits -- and that his scapegrace brother Durfey had helped to lower still farther the depressed condition of the family . All this must be retrieved , now that events had made Harold the head of the Transome name . Jermyn must be used for the election , and after that if he must be got rid of , it would be well to shake him loose quietly ; his uncle was probably right on both these points . But Harold 's expectation that he should want to get rid of Jermyn was founded on other reasons than his scented handkerchief and his charity-school Latin . If the lawyer had been presuming on Mrs. Transome 's ignorance as a woman , and on the stupid rakishness of the original heir , the new heir would prove to him that he had calculated rashly . Otherwise , Harold had no prejudice against him . In his boyhood and youth he had seen Jermyn frequenting Transome Court , but had regarded him with that total indifference with which youngsters are apt to view those who neither deny them pleasure nor give them any . Jermyn used to smile at him , and speak to him affably ; but Harold , half proud , half shy , got away from such patronage as soon as possible ; he knew Jermyn was a man of business ; his father , his uncle , and Sir Maximus Debarry did not regard him as a gentleman and their equal . He had known no evil of the man ; but he saw now that if he were really a covetous upstart , there had been a temptation for him in the management of the Transome affairs ; and it was clear that the estate was in a bad condition . When Mr. Jermyn was ushered into the breakfast-room the next morning , Harold found him surprisingly little altered by the fifteen years . He was gray , but still remarkably handsome ; fat , but tall enough to bear that trial to man 's dignity . There was as strong a suggestion of toilette about him as if he had been five-and-twenty instead of nearly sixty . He chose always to dress in black , and was especially addicted to black satin waistcoats , which carried out the general sleekness of his appearance ; and this , together with his white , fat , but beautifully-shaped hands , which he was in the habit of rubbing gently on his entrance into a room , gave him very much the air of a lady's physician . Harold remembered with some amusement his uncle 's dislike of those conspicuous hands ; but as his own were soft and dimpled , and as he too was given to the innocent practice of rubbing those members , his suspicions were not yet deepened . `` I congratulate you , Mrs. Transome , '' said Jermyn , with a soft and deferential smile , `` all the more , '' he added , turning toward Harold , `` now I have the pleasure of actually seeing your son . I am glad to perceive that an Eastern climate has not been unfavorable to him . '' `` No , '' said Harold , shaking Jermyn 's hand carelessly , and speaking with more than his usual brusqueness , `` the question is , whether the English climate will agree with me . It 's deuced shifting and damp ; and as for the food , it would be the finest thing in the world for this country if the southern cooks would change their religion , get persecuted , and fly to England , as the old silk-weavers did . '' `` There are plenty of foreign cooks for those who are rich enough to pay for them , I suppose , '' said Mrs. Transome , `` but they are unpleasant people to have about one 's house . '' `` Gad ! I do n't think so , '' said Harold . `` The old servants are sure to quarrel with them . '' `` That 's no concern of mine . The old servants will have to put up with my man Dominic , who will show them how to cook and do everything else in a way that will rather astonish them . '' `` Old people are not so easily taught to change all their ways , Harold . '' `` Well , they can give up and watch the young ones , '' said Harold , thinking only at that moment of old Mrs. Hickes and Dominic . But his mother was not thinking of them only . `` You have a valuable servant , it seems , '' said Jermyn , who understood Mrs. Transome better than her son did , and wished to smoothen the current of their dialogue . `` Oh , one of those wonderful southern fellows that make one 's life easy . He 's of no country in particular . I do n't know whether he 's most of a Jew , a Greek , an Italian , or a Spaniard . He speaks five or six languages , one as well as another . He 's cook , valet , major-domo , and secretary all in one ; and what 's more , he 's an affectionate fellow -- I can trust to his attachment . That 's a sort of human specimen that does n't grow here in England , I fancy . I should have been badly off if I could not have brought Dominic . '' They sat down to breakfast with such slight talk as this going on . Each of the party was preoccupied and uneasy . Harold 's mind was busy constructing probabilities about what he should discover of Jermyn's mismanagement or dubious application of funds , and the sort of self-command he must in the worst case exercise in order to use the man as long as he wanted him . Jermyn was closely observing Harold with an unpleasant sense that there was an expression of acuteness and determination about him which would make him formidable . He would certainly have preferred at that moment that there had been no second heir of the Transome name to come back upon him from the East . Mrs. Transome was not observing the two men ; rather , her hands were cold , and her whole person shaken by their presence ; she seemed to hear and see what they said and did with preternatural acuteness , and yet she was also seeing and hearing what had been said and done many years before , and feeling a dim terror about the future . There were piteous sensibilities in this faded woman , who thirty-four years ago , in the splendor of her bloom , had been imperious to one of these men , and had rapturously pressed the other as an infant to her bosom , and now knew that she was of little consequence to either of them . `` Well , what are the prospects about election ? '' said Harold , as the breakfast was advancing . `` There are two Whigs and one Conservative likely to be in the field , I know . What is your opinion of the chances ? '' Mr. Jermyn had a copious supply of words which often led him into periphrase , but he cultivated a hesitating stammer , which , with a handsome impassiveness of face , except when he was smiling at a woman , or when the latent savageness of his nature was thoroughly roused , he had found useful in many relations , especially in business . No one could have found out that he was not at his ease . `` My opinion , '' he replied , '' is in a state of balance at present . This division of the county , you are aware , contains one manufacturing town of the first magnitude , and several smaller ones . The manufacturing interest is widely dispersed . So far -- a -- there is a presumption -- a -- in favor of the two Liberal candidates . Still , with a careful canvass of the agricultural districts , such as those we have round us at Treby Magna , I think -- a -- the auguries -- a -- would not be unfavorable to the return of a Conservative . A fourth candidate of good position , who should coalesce with Mr. Debarry -- a -- -- '' Here Mr. Jermyn hesitated for the third time , and Harold broke in . `` That will not be my line of action , so we need not discuss it . If I put up it will be as a Radical ; and I fancy , in any county that would return Whigs there would be plenty of voters to be combed off by a Radical who offered himself with good pretensions . '' There was the slightest possible quiver discernible across Jermyn's face . Otherwise he sat as he had done before , with his eyes fixed abstractedly on the frill of a ham before him , and his hand trifling with his fork . He did not answer immediately , but , when he did , he looked round steadily at Harold . `` I 'm delighted to perceive that you have kept yourself so thoroughly acquainted with English politics . '' `` Oh , of course , '' said Harold , impatiently . `` I 'm aware how things have been going on in England . I always meant to come back ultimately . I suppose I know the state of Europe as well as if I 'd been stationary at Little Treby for the last fifteen years . If a man goes to the East , people seem to think he gets turned into something like the one-eyed calender in the 'Arabian Nights ! ' '' `` Yet I should think there are some things which people who have been stationary at Little Treby could tell you , Harold , '' said Mrs. Transome . `` It did not signify about your holding Radical opinions at Smyrna ; but you seem not to imagine how your putting up as a Radical will affect your position here , and the position of your family . No one will visit you . And then -- the sort of people who will support you ! You really have no idea what an impression it conveys when you say you are a Radical . There are none of our equals who will not feel that you have disgraced yourself . '' `` Pooh ! '' said Harold , rising and walking along the room . But Mrs. Transome went on with growing anger in her voice -- '' It seems to me that a man owes something to his birth and station , and has no right to take up this notion or other , just as it suits his fancy ; still less to work at the overthrow of his class . That was what every one said of Lord Grey , and my family at least is as good as Lord Grey 's . You have wealth now , and might distinguish yourself in the county ; and if you had been true to your colors as a gentleman , you would have had all the greater opportunity , because the times are so bad . The Debarrys and Lord Wyvern would have set all the more store by you . For my part , I can't conceive what good you propose to yourself . I only entreat you to think again before you take any decided step . '' `` Mother , '' said Harold , not angrily or with any raising of his voice , but in a quick , impatient manner , as if the scene must be got through as quickly as possible ; `` it is natural that you should think in this way . Women , very properly , do n't change their views , but keep to the notions in which they have been brought up . It does n't signify what they think -- they are not called upon to judge or to act . You must leave me to take my own course in these matters , which properly belong to men . Beyond that , I will gratify any wish you may choose to mention . You shall have a new carriage and a pair of bays all to yourself ; you shall have the house done up in first-rate style , and I am not thinking of marrying . But let us understand that there shall be no further collision between us on subjects on which I must be master of my own actions . '' `` And you will put the crown to the mortifications of my life , Harold . I do n't know who would be a mother if she could foresee what a slight thing she will be to her son when she is old . '' Mrs. Transome here walked out of the room by the nearest way -- the glass door open toward the terrace . Mr. Jermyn had risen too , and his hands were on the back of his chair . He looked quite impassive : it was not the first time he had seen Mrs. Transome angry ; but now , for the first time , he thought the outburst of her temper would be useful to him . She , poor woman , knew quite well that she had been unwise , and that she had been making herself disagreeable to Harold to no purpose . But half the sorrows of women would be averted if they could repress the speech they know to be useless -- nay , the speech they have resolved not to utter . Harold continued his walking a moment longer , and then said to Jermyn -- '' You smoke ? '' `` No , I always defer to the ladies . Mrs. Jermyn is peculiarly sensitive in such matters , and does n't like tobacco . '' Harold , who , underneath all the tendencies which had made him a Liberal , had intense personal pride , thought , `` Confound the fellow -- with his Mrs. Jermyn ! Does he think we are on a footing for me to know anything about his wife ? '' `` Well , I took my hookah before breakfast , '' he said aloud , `` so , if you like , we 'll go into the library . My father never gets up till midday , I find . '' `` Sit down , sit down , '' said Harold , as they entered the handsome , spacious library . But he himself continued to stand before a map of the county which he had opened from a series of rollers occupying a compartment among the bookshelves . `` The first question , Mr. Jermyn , now you know my intentions , is , whether you will undertake to be my agent in this election , and help me through ? There 's no time to be lost , and I do n't want to lose my chance , as I may not have another for seven years . I understand , '' he went on , flashing a look straight at Jermyn , `` that you have not taken any conspicuous course in politics , and I know that Labron is agent for the Debarrys . '' `` Oh -- a -- my dear sir -- a man necessarily has his political convictions , but of what use is it for a professional man -- a -- of some education , to talk of them in a little country town ? There really is no comprehension of public questions in such places . Party feeling , indeed , was quite asleep here before the agitation about the Catholic Relief Bill . It is true that I concurred with our incumbent in getting up a petition against the Reform Bill , but I did not state my reasons . The weak points in that Bill are -- a -- too palpable , and I fancy you and I should not differ much on that head . The fact is , when I knew that you were to come back to us , I kept myself in reserve , though I was much pressed by the friends of Sir James Clement , the Ministerial candidate , who is -- -- '' '' However , you will act for me -- that 's settled ? '' said Harold . `` Certainly , '' said Jermyn , inwardly irritated by Harold 's rapid manner of cutting him short . `` Which of the Liberal candidates , as they call themselves , has the better chance , eh ? '' `` I was going to observe that Sir James Clement has not so good a chance as Mr. Garstin , supposing that a third Liberal candidate presents himself . There are two senses in which a politician can be liberal '' -- here Mr. Jermyn smiled -- '' Sir James Clement is a poor baronet , hoping for an appointment , and ca n't be expected to be liberal in that wider sense which commands majorities . '' `` I wish this man were not so much of a talker , '' thought Harold , `` he'll bore me . We shall see , '' he said aloud , `` what can be done in the way of combination . I 'll come down to your office after one o'clock if it will suit you ? '' `` Perfectly . '' `` Ah , and you 'll have all the lists and papers and necessary information ready for me there . I must get up a dinner for the tenants , and we can invite whom we like besides the tenants . Just now , I 'm going over one of the farms on hand with the bailiff . By the way , that 's a desperately bad business , having three farms unlet -- how comes that about , eh ? '' `` That is precisely what I wanted to say a few words about to you . You have observed already how strongly Mrs. Transome takes certain things to heart . You can imagine that she has been severely tried in many ways . Mr. Transome 's want of health ; Mr. Durfey 's habits -- a -- -- '' '' Yes , yes . '' `` She is a woman for whom I naturally entertain the highest respect , and she has had hardly any gratification for many years , except the sense of having affairs to a certain extent in her own hands . She objects to changes ; she will not have a new style of tenants ; she likes the old stock of farmers who milk their own cows , and send their younger daughters out to service : all this makes it difficult to do the best with the estate . I am aware things are not as they ought to be , for , in point of fact , improved agricultural management is a matter in which I take considerable interest , and the farm which I myself hold on the estate you will see , I think , to be in a superior condition . But Mrs. Transome is a woman of strong feeling , and I would urge you , my dear sir , to make the changes which you have , but which I had not the right to insist on , as little painful to her as possible . '' `` I shall know what to do , sir , never fear , '' said Harold , much offended . `` You will pardon , I hope , a perhaps undue freedom of suggestion from a man of my age , who has been so long in a close connection with the family affairs -- a -- I have never considered that connection simply in a light of business -- a -- -- '' '' Damn him , I 'll soon let him know that _I_ do , '' thought Harold . But in proportion as he found Jermyn 's manners annoying , he felt the necessity of controlling himself . He despised all persons who defeated their own projects by the indulgence of momentary impulses . `` I understand , I understand , '' he said aloud . `` You 've had more awkward business on your hands than usually falls to the share of a family lawyer . We shall set everything right by degrees . But now as to the canvassing . I 've made arrangements with a first-rate man in London , who understands these matters thoroughly -- a solicitor , of course -- he has carried no end of men into Parliament . I 'll engage him to meet us at Duffield -- say when ? '' The conversation after this was driven carefully clear of all angles , and ended with determined amicableness . When Harold , in his ride an hour or two afterward , encountered his uncle shouldering a gun , and followed by one black and one liver-spotted pointer , his muscular person with its red eagle face set off by a velveteen jacket and leather leggings , Mr. Lingon 's first question was -- '' Well , lad , how have you got on with Jermyn ? '' `` Oh , I do n't think I shall like the fellow . He 's a sort of amateur gentleman . But I must make use of him . I expect whatever I get out of him will only be something short of fair pay for what he has got out of us . But I shall see . '' `` Ay , ay , use his gun to bring down your game , and after that , beat the thief with the butt end . That 's wisdom and justice and pleasure all in one -- talking between ourselves as uncle and nephew . But I say , Harold , I was going to tell you , now I come to think of it , this is rather a nasty business , your calling yourself a Radical . I 've been turning it over in after-dinner speeches , but it looks awkward -- it 's not what people are used to -- it wants a good deal of Latin to make it go down . I shall be worried about it at the sessions , and I can think of nothing neat enough to carry about in my pocket by way of answer . '' `` Nonsense , uncle ! I remember what a good speechifier you always were ; you 'll never be at a loss . You only want a few more evenings to think of it . '' `` But you 'll not be attacking the Church and the institutions of the country -- you 'll not be going those lengths ; you 'll keep up the bulwarks , and so on , eh ? '' `` No , I sha n't attack the Church , only the incomes of the bishops , perhaps , to make them eke out the incomes of the poor clergy . '' `` Well , well , I have no objection to that . Nobody likes our bishop : he's all Greek and greediness ; too proud to dine with his own father . You may pepper the bishops a little . But you 'll respect the constitution handed down , etc. -- and you 'll rally round the throne -- and the King , God bless him , and the usual toasts , eh ? '' `` Of course , of course . I am a Radical only in rooting out abuses . '' `` That 's the word I wanted , my lad ! '' said the vicar , slapping Harold's knee . `` That 's a spool to wind a speech on . Abuses is the very word ; and if anybody shows himself offended , he 'll put the cap on for himself . '' `` I remove the rotten timbers , '' said Harold , inwardly amused , `` and substitute fresh oak , that 's all . '' `` Well done , my boy ! But I say , Harold , I hope you 've got a little Latin left . This young Debarry is a tremendous fellow at the classics , and walks on stilts to any length . He 's one of the new Conservatives . Old Sir Maximus does n't understand him at all . '' `` That wo n't do at the hustings , '' said Harold . `` He 'll get knocked off his stilts pretty quickly there . '' `` Bless me ! it 's astonishing how well you 're up in the affairs of the country , my boy . But rub up a few quotations -- '_Quod turpe bonis decebat Crispinum_ ' -- and that sort of thing -- just to show Debarry what you could do if you liked . But you want to ride on ? '' `` Yes ; I have an appointment at Treby . Good-bye . '' `` He 's a cleverish chap , '' muttered the vicar , as Harold rode away . `` When he 's had plenty of English exercise , and brought out his knuckle a bit , he 'll be a Lingon again as he used to be . I must go and see how Arabella takes his being a Radical . It 's a little awkward ; but a clergyman must keep peace in a family . Confound it ! I 'm not bound to love Toryism better than my own flesh and blood , and the manor I shoot over . That 's a heathenish , Brutus-like sort of thing , as if Providence could n't take care of the country without my quarrelling with my own sister 's son ! '' CHAPTER III . 'T was town , yet country too : you felt the warmth Of clustering houses in the wintry time : Supped with a friend , and went by lantern home . Yet from your chamber window you could hear The tiny bleat of new-yeaned lambs , or see The children bend beside the hedgerow banks To pluck the primroses . Treby Magna , on which the Reform Bill had thrust the new honor of being a polling-place , had been , at the beginning of the century , quite a typical old market-town , lying in pleasant sleepiness among green pastures , with a rush-fringed river meandering through them . Its principal street had various handsome and tall-windowed brick houses with walled gardens behind them ; and at the end , where it widened into the market-place , there was the cheerful rough-stuccoed front of that excellent inn , the Marquis of Granby , where the farmers put up their gigs , not only on fair and market days , but on exceptional Sundays when they came to church . And the church was one of those fine old English structures worth travelling to see , standing in a broad churchyard with a line of solemn yew-trees beside it , and lifting a majestic tower and spire far above the red-and-purple roofs of the town . It was not large enough to hold all the parishioners of a parish which stretched over distant villages and hamlets ; but then they were never so unreasonable as to wish to be all in at once , and had never complained that the space of a large side-chapel was taken up by the tombs of the Debarrys , and shut in by a handsome iron screen . For when the black Benedictines ceased to pray and chant in this church , when the Blessed Virgin and St. Gregory were expelled , the Debarrys , as lords of the manor , naturally came next to Providence and took the place of the saints . Long before that time , indeed , there had been a Sir Maximus Debarry who had been at the fortifying of the old castle , which now stood in ruins in the midst of the green pastures , and with its sheltering wall toward the north made an excellent strawyard for the pigs of Wace & Co. , brewers of the celebrated Treby beer . Wace & Co. did not stand alone in the town as prosperous traders on a large scale , to say nothing of those who had retired from business ; and in no country town of the same small size as Treby was there a larger proportion of families who had handsome sets of china without handles , hereditary punch-bowls , and large silver ladles with a Queen Anne 's guinea in the centre . Such people naturally took tea and supped together frequently ; and as there was no professional man or tradesman in Treby who was not connected by business , if not by blood , with the farmers of the district , the richer sort of these were much invited , and gave invitations in their turn . They played at whist , ate and drank generously , praised Mr. Pitt and the war as keeping up prices and religion , and were very humorous about each other 's property , having much the same coy pleasure in allusions to their secret ability to purchase , as blushing lasses sometimes have in jokes about their secret preferences . The rector was always of the Debarry family , associated only with county people , and was much respected for his affability ; a clergyman who would have taken tea with the townspeople would have given a dangerous shock to the mind of a Treby churchman . Such was the old-fashioned , grazing , brewing , wool-packing , cheese-loading life of Treby Magna , until there befell new conditions , complicating its relation with the rest of the world , and gradually awakening in it that higher consciousness which is known to bring higher pains . First came the canal ; next , the working of the coal-mines at Sproxton , two miles off the town ; and thirdly , the discovery of a saline spring , which suggested to a too constructive brain the possibility of turning Treby Magna into a fashionable watering-place . So daring an idea was not originated by a native Trebian , but by a young lawyer who came from a distance , knew the dictionary by heart , and was probably an illegitimate son of somebody or other . The idea , although it promised an increase of wealth to the town , was not well received at first ; ladies objected to seeing `` objects '' drawn about in hand-carriages , the doctor foresaw the advent of unsound practitioners , and most retail tradesmen concurred with him that new doings were usually for the advantage of new people . The more unanswerable reasoners urged that Treby had prospered without baths , and it was yet to be seen how it would prosper with them ; while a report that the proposed name for them was Bethesda Spa , threatened to give the whole affair a blasphemous aspect . Even Sir Maximus Debarry , who was to have an unprecedented return for the thousands he would lay out on a pump-room and hotel , regarded the thing as a little too new , and held back for some time . But the persuasive powers of the young lawyer , Mr. Matthew Jermyn , together with the opportune opening of a stone-quarry , triumphed at last ; the handsome buildings were erected , an excellent guide-book and descriptive cards , surmounted by vignettes , were printed , and Treby Magna became conscious of certain facts in its own history of which it had previously been in contented ignorance . But it was all in vain . The Spa , for some mysterious reason , did not succeed . Some attributed the failure to the coal-mines and the canal ; others to the peace , which had had ruinous effects on the country ; and others , who disliked Jermyn , to the original folly of the plan . Among these last was Sir Maximus himself , who never forgave the too persuasive attorney : it was Jermyn 's fault not only that a useless hotel had been built , but that he , Sir Maximus , being straitened for money , had at last let the building , with the adjacent land lying on the river , on a long lease , on the supposition that it was to be turned into a tape manufactory -- a bitter thing to any gentleman , and especially to the representative of one of the oldest families in England . In this way it happened that Treby Magna gradually passed from being simply a respectable market town -- the heart of a great rural district , where the trade was only such as had close relations with the local landed interest -- and took on the more complex life brought by mines and manufactures , which belong more directly to the great circulating system of the nation than to the local system to which they had been superadded ; and in this way it was that Trebian Dissent gradually altered its character . Formerly it had been of a quiescent , well-to-do kind , represented architecturally by a small , venerable , dark-pewed chapel , built by Presbyterians , but long occupied by a sparse congregation of Independents , who were as little moved by doctrinal zeal as their church-going neighbors , and did not feel themselves deficient in religious liberty , inasmuch as they were not hindered from occasionally slumbering in their pews , and were not obliged to go regularly to the weekly prayer-meeting . But when stone-pits and coal-pits made new hamlets that threatened to spread up to the very town , when the tape-weavers came with their news-reading inspectors and book-keepers , the Independent chapel began to be filled with eager men and women , to whom the exceptional possession of religious truth was the condition which reconciled them to a meagre existence , and made them feel in secure alliance with the unseen but supreme rule of a world in which their own visible part was small . There were Dissenters in Treby now who could not be regarded by the Church people in the light of old neighbors to whom the habit of going to chapel was an innocent , unenviable inheritance along with a particular house and garden , a tan-yard , or a grocery business -- Dissenters who , in their turn , without meaning to be in the least abusive , spoke of the high-bred rector as a blind leader of the blind . And Dissent was not the only thing that the times had altered ; prices had fallen , poor-rates had risen , rent and tithe were not elastic enough , and the farmer 's fat sorrow had become lean ; he began to speculate on causes , and to trace things back to that causeless mystery , the cessation of one-pound notes . Thus , when political agitation swept in a current through the country , Treby Magna was prepared to vibrate . The Catholic Emancipation Bill opened the eyes of neighbors and made them aware how very injurious they were to each other and to the welfare of mankind generally . Mr. Tiliot , the Church spirit-merchant , knew now that Mr. Nuttwood , the obliging grocer , was one of those Dissenters , Deists , Socinians , Papists , and Radicals , who were in league to destroy the Constitution . The rector , the Reverend Augustus Debarry , really a fine specimen of the old-fashioned aristocratic clergyman , preaching short sermons , understanding business , and acting liberally about his tithe , had never before found himself in collision with Dissenters ; but now he began to feel that these people were a nuisance in the parish , that his brother Sir Maximus must take care lest they should get land to build more chapels , and that it might not have been a bad thing if the law had furnished him as a magistrate with a power of putting a stop to the political sermons of the Independent preacher , which , in their way , were as pernicious sources of intoxication as the beerhouses . The Dissenters , on their side , were not disposed to sacrifice the cause of truth and freedom to a temporizing mildness of language ; but they defended themselves from the charge of religious indifference , and solemnly disclaimed any lax expectations that Catholics were likely to be saved -- urging , on the contrary , that they were not too hopeful about Protestants who adhered to a bloated and worldly Prelacy . Thus Treby Magna , which had lived quietly through the great earthquakes of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars , which had remained unmoved by the `` Rights of Man , '' and saw little in Mr. Cobbett 's `` Weekly Register '' except that he held eccentric views about potatoes , began at last to know the higher pains of a dim political consciousness ; and the development had been greatly helped by the recent agitation about the Reform Bill . Tory , Whig , and Radical did not perhaps become clearer in their definition of each other ; but the names seemed to acquire so strong a stamp of honor or infamy , that definitions would only have weakened the impression . As to the short and easy method of judging opinions by the personal character of those who held them , it was liable to be much frustrated in Treby . It so happened in that particular town that the Reformers were not all of them large-hearted patriots or ardent lovers of justice ; indeed , one of them , in the very midst of the agitation , was detected in using unequal scales -- a fact to which many Tories pointed with disgust as showing plainly enough , without further argument , that the cry for a change in the representative system was hollow trickery . Again , the Tories were far from being all oppressors , disposed to grind down the working classes into serfdom ; and it was undeniable that the inspector at the tape manufactory , who spoke with much eloquence on the extension of the suffrage , was a more tyrannical personage than open-handed Mr. Wace , whose chief political tenet was that it was all nonsense to give men votes when they had no stake in the country . On the other hand there were some Tories who gave themselves a great deal of leisure to abuse hypocrites , Radicals , Dissenters , and atheism generally , but whose inflamed faces , theistic swearing , and frankness in expressing a wish to borrow , certainly did not mark them out strongly as holding opinions likely to save society . The Reformers had triumphed : it was clear that the wheels were going whither they were pulling , and they were in fine spirits for exertion . But if they were pulling toward the country 's ruin , there was the more need for others to hang on behind and get the wheels to stick if possible . In Treby , as elsewhere , people were told they must `` rally '' at the coming election ; but there was now a large number of waverers -- men of flexible , practical minds , who were not such bigots as to cling to any views when a good tangible reason could be urged against them ; while some regarded it as the most neighborly thing to hold a little with both sides , and were not sure that they should rally or vote at all . It seemed an invidious thing to vote for one gentleman rather than another . These social changes in Treby parish are comparatively public matters , and this history is chiefly concerned with the private lot of a few men and women ; but there is no private life which has not been determined by a wider public life , from the time when the primeval milkmaid had to wander with the wanderings of her clan , because the cow she milked was one of a herd which had made the pastures bare . Even in that conservatory existence where the fair Camellia is sighed for by the noble young Pine-apple , neither of them needing to care about the frost , or rain outside , there is a nether apparatus of hot water pipes liable to cool down on a strike of the gardeners or a scarcity of coal . And the lives we are about to look back upon do not belong to those conservatory species ; they are rooted in the common earth , having to endure all the ordinary chances of past and present weather . As to the weather of 1832 , the Zadkiel of that time had predicted that the electrical condition of the clouds in the political hemisphere would produce unusual perturbations in organic existence , and he would perhaps have seen a fulfillment of his remarkable prophecy in that mutual influence of dissimilar destinies which we shall see gradually unfolding itself . For if the mixed political conditions of Treby Magna had not been acted on by the passing of the Reform Bill , Mr. Harold Transome would not have presented himself as a candidate for North Loamshire , Treby would not have been a polling-place , Mr. Matthew Jermyn would not have been on affable terms with a Dissenting preacher and his flock , and the venerable town would not have been placarded with handbills , more or less complimentary and retrospective -- conditions in this case essential to the `` where , '' and the `` what , '' without which , as the learned know , there can be no event whatever . For example , it was through these conditions that a young man named Felix Holt made a considerable difference in the life of Harold Transome , though nature and fortune seemed to have done what they could to keep the lots of the two men quite aloof from each other . Felix was heir to nothing better than a quack medicine ; his mother lived up a back street in Treby Magna , and her sitting-room was ornamented with her best tea-tray and several framed testimonials to the virtues of Holt's Cathartic Lozenges and Holt 's Restorative Elixir . There could hardly have been a lot less like Harold Transome 's than this of the quack doctor 's son , except in the superficial facts that he called himself a Radical , that he was the only son of his mother , and that he had lately returned to his home with ideas and resolves not a little disturbing to that mother 's mind . But Mrs. Holt , unlike Mrs. Transome , was much disposed to reveal her troubles , and was not without a counsellor into whose ear she could pour them . On this second of September , when Mr. Harold Transome had had his first interview with Jermyn , and when the attorney went back to his office with new views of canvassing in his mind , Mrs. Holt had put on her bonnet as early as nine o'clock in the morning , and had gone to see the Reverend Rufus Lyon , minister of the Independent Chapel usually spoken of as `` Malthouse Yard . '' CHAPTER IV . `` A pious and painful preacher. '' -- FULLER . Mr. Lyon lived in a small house , not quite so good as the parish clerk 's , adjoining the entry which led to the Chapel Yard . The new prosperity of Dissent at Treby had led to an enlargement of the chapel , which absorbed all extra funds and left none for the enlargement of the minister 's income . He sat this morning , as usual , in a low up-stairs room , called his study , which , by means of a closet capable of holding his bed , served also as a sleeping-room . The bookshelves did not suffice for his store of old books , which lay about him in piles so arranged as to leave narrow lanes between them ; for the minister was much given to walking about during his hours of meditation , and very narrow passages would serve for his small legs , unencumbered by any other drapery than his black silk stockings and the flexible , though prominent , bows of black ribbon that tied his knee-breeches . He was walking about now , with his hands clasped behind him , an attitude in which his body seemed to bear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone Hermes bears to the carven image that crowns it . His face looked old and worn , yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint , and his large , brown , short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright . At the first glance , every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man ; the free-school boys often hooted after him , and called him `` Revelations '' ; and to many respectable Church people , old Lyon 's little legs and large head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous . But he was too short-sighted to notice those who tittered at him -- too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live . With Satan to argue against on matters of vital experience as well as of church government , with great texts to meditate on , which seemed to get deeper as he tried to fathom them , it had never occurred to him to reflect what sort of image his small person made on the retina of a light-minded beholder . The good Rufus had his ire and his egoism ; but they existed only as the red heat which gave force to his belief and his teaching . He was susceptible concerning the true office of deacons in the primitive Church , and his small nervous body was jarred from head to foot by the concussion of an argument to which he saw no answer . In fact , the only moments when he could be said to be really conscious of his body , were when he trembled under the pressure of some agitating thought . He was meditating on the text for his Sunday morning sermon , `` And all the people said , Amen '' -- a mere mustard-seed of a text , which had split at first only into two divisions , `` What was said , '' and `` Who said it '' ; but these were growing into a many-branched discourse , and the preacher 's eyes dilated , and a smile played about his mouth till , as his manner was , when he felt happily inspired , he had begun to utter his thoughts aloud in the varied measure and cadence habitual to him , changing from a rapid but distinct undertone to a loud emphatic _rallentando_ . `` My brethren , do you think that great shout was raised in Israel by each man 's waiting to say 'amen ' till his neighbors had said amen ? Do you think there will be a great shout for the right -- the shout of a nation as of one man , rounded and whole , like the voice of the archangel that bound together all the listeners of earth and heaven -- if every Christian of you peeps round to see what his neighbors in good coats are doing , or else puts his hat before his face that he may shout and never be heard ? But this is what you do : when the servant of God stands up to deliver his message , do you lay your souls beneath the Word as you set out your plants beneath the falling rain ? No ; one of you sends his eyes to all corners , he smothers his soul with small questions , 'What does brother Y . think ? ' 'Is this doctrine high enough for brother Z. ? ' 'Will the church members be pleased ? ' And another -- -- '' Here the door was opened , and old Lyddy , the minister 's servant , put in her head to say , in a tone of despondency , finishing with a groan , `` Here is Mrs. Holt wanting to speak to you ; she says she comes out of season , but she 's in trouble . '' `` Lyddy , '' said Mr. Lyon , falling at once into a quiet conversational tone , `` if you are wrestling with the enemy , let me refer you to Ezekiel the thirteenth and twenty-second , and beg of you not to groan . It is a stumbling-block and offence to my daughter ; she would take no broth yesterday , because she said you had cried into it . Thus you cause the truth to be lightly spoken of , and make the enemy rejoice . If your faceache gives him an advantage , take a little warm ale with your meat -- I do not grudge the money . '' `` If I thought my drinking warm ale would hinder poor dear Miss Esther from speaking light -- but she hates the smell of it . '' `` Answer not again , Lyddy , but send up Mistress Holt to me . '' Lyddy closed the door immediately . `` I lack grace to deal with these weak sisters , '' said the minister , again thinking aloud , and walking . `` Their needs lie too much out of the track of my meditations , and take me often unawares . Mistress Holt is another who darkens counsel by words without knowledge , and angers the reason of the natural man . Lord , give me patience . My sins were heavier to bear than this woman 's folly . Come in , Mrs. Holt -- come in . '' He hastened to disencumber a chair of Matthew Henry 's Commentary , and begged his visitor to be seated . She was a tall elderly woman , dressed in black , with a light-brown front and a black band over her forehead . She moved the chair a little and seated herself in it with some emphasis , looking fixedly at the opposite wall with a hurt and argumentative expression . Mr. Lyon had placed himself in the chair against his desk , and waited with the resolute resignation of a patient who is about to undergo an operation . But his visitor did not speak . `` You have something on your mind , Mrs . Holt ? '' he said , at last . `` Indeed I have , sir , else I should n't be here . '' `` Speak freely . '' `` It 's well known to you , Mr. Lyon , that my husband , Mr. Holt , came from the north , and was a member in Malthouse Yard long before _you_ began to be pastor of it , which was seven year ago last Michaelmas . It 's the truth , Mr. Lyon , and I 'm not that woman to sit here and say it if it was n't true . '' `` Certainly , it is true . '' `` And if my husband had been alive when you 'd come to preach upon trial , he 'd have been as good a judge of your gifts as Mr. Nuttwood or Mr. Muscat , though whether he 'd have agreed with some that your doctrine was n't high enough , I ca n't say . For myself , I 've my opinion about high doctrine . '' `` Was it my preaching you came to speak about ? '' said the minister , hurrying in the question . `` No , Mr. Lyon , I 'm not that woman . But this I _will_ say , for my husband died before your time , that he had a wonderful gift in prayer , as the old members well know , if anybody likes to ask 'em , not believing my words , and he believed himself that the receipt for the Cancer Cure , which I 've sent out in bottles till this very last April before September as now is , and have bottles standing by me -- he believed it was sent to him in answer to prayer ; and nobody can deny it , for he prayed most regular , and read out of the green baize Bible . '' Mrs. Holt paused , appearing to think that Mr. Lyon had been successfully confuted , and should show himself convinced . `` Has any one been aspersing your husband 's character ? '' said Mr. Lyon , with a slight initiative toward that relief of groaning for which he had reproved Lyddy . `` Sir , they dared n't . For though he was a man of prayer , he did n't want skill and knowledge to find things out for himself ; and that 's what I used to say to _my_ friends when they wondered at my marrying a man from Lancashire , with no trade nor fortune , but what he 'd got in his head . But my husband 's tongue 'ud have been a fortune to anybody , and there was many a one said it was as good as a dose of physic to hear him talk ; not but what that got him into trouble in Lancashire , but he always said , if the worst came to the worst , he could go and preach to the blacks . But he did better than that , Mr. Lyon , for he married me ; and this I will say , that for age , and conduct , and managing -- -- '' '' Mistress Holt , '' interrupted the minister , `` these are not the things whereby we may edify one another . Let me beg of you to be as brief as you can . My time is not my own . '' `` Well , Mr. Lyon , I 've a right to my own character ; and I 'm one of your congregation , though I 'm not a church member , for I was born in the General Baptist connection : and as for being saved without works , there 's a many , I dare say , ca n't do without that doctrine ; but I thank the Lord I never needed to put _my_self on a level with the thief on the cross . I 've done _my_ duty , and more , if anybody comes to that ; for I've gone without my bit of meat to make broth for a sick neighbor : and if there 's any of the church members say they 've done the same , I 'd ask them if they had the sinking at the stomach as I have ; for I 've ever strove to do the right thing , and more , for good-natured I always was ; and I little thought , after being respected by everybody , I should come to be reproached by my own son . And my husband said , when he was a-dying -- 'Mary , ' he said , 'the Elixir , and the Pills , and the Cure will support you , for they 've a great name in all the country round , and you 'll pray for a blessing on them . ' And so I 've done , Mr. Lyon ; and to say they 're not good medicines , when they 've been taken for fifty miles round by high and low , rich and poor , and nobody speaking against 'em but Dr. Lukin , it seems to me it 's a flying in the face of Heaven ; for if it was wrong to take the medicines , could n't the blessed Lord have stopped it ? '' Mrs. Holt was not given to tears ; she was much sustained by conscious unimpeachableness , and by an argumentative tendency which usually checks the too great activity of the lachrymal gland ; nevertheless her eyes had become moist , her fingers played on her knee in an agitated manner , and she finally plucked a bit of her gown and held it with great nicety between her thumb and finger . Mr. Lyon , however , by listening attentively , had begun partly to divine the source of her trouble . `` Am I wrong in gathering from what you say , Mistress Holt , that your son has objected in some way to your sale of your late husband 's medicines ? '' `` Mr. Lyon , he 's masterful beyond everything , and he talks more than his father did . I 've got my reason , Mr. Lyon , and if anybody talks sense I can follow him ; but Felix talks so wild , and contradicts his mother . And what do you think he says , after giving up his 'prenticeship , and going off to study at Glasgow , and getting through all the bit of money his father saved for his bringing-up -- what has all his learning come to ? He says I 'd better never open my Bible , for it 's as bad poison to me as the pills are to half the people as swallow 'em . You 'll not speak of this again , Mr. Lyon -- I do n't think ill enough of you to believe _that_ . For I suppose a Christian can understand the word o ' God without going to Glasgow , and there 's texts upon texts about ointment and medicine , and there 's one as might have been for a receipt of my husband 's -- it 's just as if it was a riddle , and Holt 's Elixir was the answer . '' `` Your son uses rash words , Mistress Holt , '' said the minister , `` but it is quite true that we may err in giving a too private interpretation to the Scripture . The word of God has to satisfy the larger needs of His people , like the rain and the sunshine -- which no man must think to be meant for his own patch of seed-ground solely . Will it not be well that I should see your son , and talk with him on these matters ? He was at chapel , I observe , and I suppose I am to be his pastor . '' `` That was what I wanted to ask you , Mr. Lyon . For perhaps he 'll listen to you , and not talk you down as he does his poor mother . For after we'd been to chapel , he spoke better of you than he does of most : he said you was a fine old fellow , and an old-fashioned Puritan -- he uses dreadful language , Mr. Lyon ; but I saw he did n't mean you ill , for all that . He calls most folks 's religion rottenness ; and yet another time he 'll tell me I ought to feel myself a sinner , and do God 's will and not my own . But it 's my belief he says first one thing and then another only to abuse his mother . Or else he 's going off his head , and must be sent to a 'sylum . But if he writes to the _North Loamshire Herald_ first , to tell everybody the medicines are good for nothing , how can I ever keep him and myself ? '' `` Tell him I shall feel favored if he will come and see me this evening , '' said Mr. Lyon , not without a little prejudice in favor of the young man , whose language about the preacher in Malthouse Yard did not seem to him to be altogether dreadful . `` Meanwhile , my friend , I counsel you to send up a supplication , which I shall not fail to offer also , that you may receive a spirit of humility and submission , so that you may not be hindered from seeing and following the Divine guidance in this matter by any false lights of pride and obstinacy . Of this more when I have spoken with your son . '' `` I 'm not proud or obstinate , Mr. Lyon . I never did say I was everything that was bad , and I never will . And why this trouble should be sent on me above everybody else -- for I have n't told you all . He 's made himself a journeyman to Mr. Prowd the watchmaker -- after all this learning -- and he says he 'll go with patches on his knees , and he shall like himself the better . And as for him having little boys to teach , they 'll come in all weathers with dirty shoes . If it 's madness , Mr. Lyon , it 's no use your talking to him . '' `` We shall see . Perhaps it may even be the disguised working of grace within him . We must not judge rashly . Many eminent servants of God have been led by ways as strange . '' `` Then I 'm sorry for their mothers , that 's all , Mr. Lyon ; and all the more if they 'd been well-spoken-on women . For not my biggest enemy , whether it 's he or she , if they 'll speak the truth , can turn round and say I 've deserved this trouble . And when everybody gets their due , and people 's doings are spoke of on the house-tops , as the Bible says they will be , it 'll be known what I 've gone through with those medicines -- the pounding and the pouring , and the letting stand , and the weighing -- up early and down late -- there 's nobody knows yet but One that 's worthy to know ; and the pasting o ' the printed labels right side upwards . There's few women would have gone through with it ; and it 's reasonable to think it 'll be made up to me ; for if there 's promised and purchased blessings , I should think this trouble is purchasing 'em . For if my son Felix does n't have a strait-waistcoat put on him , he 'll have his way . But I say no more . I wish you good-morning , Mr. Lyon , and thank you , though I well know it 's your duty to act as you 're doing . And I never troubled you about my own soul , as some do who look down on me for not being a church member . '' `` Farewell , Mistress Holt , farewell . I pray that a more powerful teacher than I am may instruct you . '' The door was closed , and the much-tried Rufus walked about again , saying aloud , groaningly -- '' This woman has sat under the Gospel all her life , and she is as blind as a heathen , and as proud and stiff-necked as a Pharisee ; yet she is one of the souls I watch for . 'T is true that even Sara , the chosen mother of God 's people , showed a spirit of unbelief , and perhaps of selfish anger ; and it is a passage that bears the unmistakable signet , 'doing honor to the wife or woman , as unto the weaker vessel . ' For therein is the greatest check put on the ready scorn of the natural man . '' CHAPTER V. 1ST CITIZEN . Sir , there 's a hurry in the veins of youth That makes a vice of virtue by excess . 2D CITIZEN . What if the coolness of our tardier veins Be loss of virtue ? 1ST CITIZEN . All things cool with time -- The sun itself , they say , till heat shall find A general level , nowhere in excess . 2D CITIZEN . 'T is a poor climax , to my weaker thought , That future middlingness . In the evening , when Mr. Lyon was expecting the knock at the door that would announce Felix Holt , he occupied his cushionless arm-chair in the sitting-room , and was skimming rapidly , in his short-sighted way , by the light of one candle , the pages of a missionary report , emitting occasionally a slight `` Hm-m '' that appeared to be expressive of criticism rather than of approbation . The room was dismally furnished , the only objects indicating an intention of ornament being a bookcase , a map of the Holy Land , an engraved portrait of Dr. Doddridge , and a black bust with a colored face , which for some reason or other was covered with green gauze . Yet any one whose attention was quite awake must have been aware , even on entering , of certain things that were incongruous with the general air of sombreness and privation . There was a delicate scent of dried rose-leaves ; the light by which the minister was reading was a wax-candle in a white earthenware candle-stick , and the table on the opposite side of the fireplace held a dainty work-basket frilled with blue satin . Felix Holt , when he entered , was not in an observant mood ; and when , after seating himself , at the minister 's invitation , near the little table which held the work-basket , he stared at the wax-candle opposite to him , he did so without any wonder or consciousness that the candle was not of tallow . But the minister 's sensitiveness gave another interpretation to the gaze which he divined rather than saw ; and in alarm lest this inconsistent extravagance should obstruct his usefulness , he hastened to say -- '' You are doubtless amazed to see me with a wax-light , my young friend ; but this undue luxury is paid for with the earnings of my daughter , who is so delicately framed that the smell of tallow is loathsome to her . '' `` I heeded not the candle , sir . I thank Heaven I am not a mouse to have a nose that takes note of wax or tallow . '' The loud abrupt tones made the old man vibrate a little . He had been stroking his chin gently before , with a sense that he must be very quiet and deliberate in his treatment of the eccentric young man ; but now , quite unreflectingly , he drew forth a pair of spectacles , which he was in the habit of using when he wanted to observe his interlocutor more closely than usual . `` And I myself , in fact , am equally indifferent , '' he said , as he opened and adjusted his glasses , `` so that I have a sufficient light on my book . '' Here his large eyes looked discerningly through the spectacles . `` 'T is the quality of the page you care about , not of the candle , '' said Felix , smiling pleasantly enough at his inspector . `` You 're thinking that you have a roughly-written page before you now . '' That was true . The minister , accustomed to the respectable air of provincial townsmen , and especially to the sleek well-clipped gravity of his own male congregation , felt a slight shock as his glasses made perfectly clear to him the shaggy-headed , large-eyed , strong-limbed person of this questionable young man , without waistcoat or cravat . But the possibility , supported by some of Mrs. Holt 's words , that a disguised work of grace might be going on in the son of whom she complained so bitterly , checked any hasty interpretations . `` I abstain from judging by the outward appearance only , '' he answered , with his usual simplicity . `` I myself have experienced that when the spirit is much exercised it is difficult to remember neck-bands and strings and such small accidents of our vesture , which are nevertheless decent and needful so long as we sojourn in the flesh . And you , too , my young friend , as I gather from your mother 's troubled and confused report , are undergoing some travail of mind . You will not , I trust , object to open yourself fully to me , as to an aged pastor who has himself had much inward wrestling , and has especially known much temptation from doubt . '' `` As to doubt , '' said Felix , loudly and brusquely as before , `` if it is those absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my mother has been talking of to you -- and I suppose it is -- I 've no more doubt about _them_ than I have about pocket-picking . I know there 's a stage of speculation in which a man may doubt whether a pickpocket is blameworthy -- but I 'm not one of your subtle fellows who keep looking at the world through their own legs . If I allowed the sale of those medicines to go on , and my mother to live out of the proceeds when I can keep her by the honest labor of my hands , I 've not the least doubt that I should be a rascal . '' `` I would fain enquire more particularly into your objection to these medicines , '' said Mr. Lyon , gravely . Notwithstanding his conscientiousness and a certain originality in his own mental disposition , he was too little used to high principle quite dissociated from sectarian phraseology to be as immediately in sympathy with it as he would otherwise have been . `` I know they have been well reported of , and many wise persons have tried remedies providentially discovered by those who are not regular physicians , and have found a blessing in the use of them . I may mention the eminent Mr. Wesley , who , though I hold not altogether with his Arminian doctrine , nor with the usages of his institutions , was nevertheless a man of God ; and the journals of various Christians whose names have left a sweet savor , might be cited in the same sense . Moreover , your father , who originally concocted these medicines and left them as a provision for your mother , was , as I understand , a man whose walk was not unfaithful . '' `` My father was ignorant , '' said Felix , bluntly . `` He knew neither the complication of the human system , nor the way in which drugs counteract each other . Ignorance is not so damnable as humbug , but when it prescribes pills it may happen to do more harm . I know something about these things . I was 'prentice for five miserable years to a stupid brute of a country apothecary -- my poor father left money for that -- he thought nothing could be finer for me . No matter : I know that the Cathartic Pills are a drastic compound which may be as bad as poison to half the people who swallow them ; that the Elixir is an absurd farrago of a dozen incompatible things ; and that the Cancer Cure might as well be bottled ditch-water . '' Mr. Lyon rose and walked up and down the room . His simplicity was strongly mixed with sagacity as well as sectarian prejudice , and he did not rely at once on a loud-spoken integrity -- Satan might have flavored it with ostentation . Presently he asked , in a rapid , low tone , `` How long have you known this , young man ? '' `` Well put , sir , '' said Felix . `` I 've known it a good deal longer than I have acted upon it , like plenty of other things . But you believe in conversion ? '' `` Yea , verily . '' `` So do I. I was converted by six weeks ' debauchery . '' The minister started . `` Young man , '' he said , solemnly , going up close to Felix and laying a hand on his shoulder , `` speak not lightly of the Divine operations , and restrain unseemly words . '' `` I 'm not speaking lightly , '' said Felix . `` If I had not seen that I was making a hog of myself very fast , and that pig-wash , even if I could have got plenty of it , was a poor sort of thing , I should never have looked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it . I laughed out loud at last to think that a poor devil like me , in a Scotch garret , with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be dissipated upon , with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below , and old women breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs -- wanting to turn my life into easy pleasure . Then I began to see what else it could be turned into . Not much , perhaps . This world is not a very fine place for a good many of the people in it . But I 've made up my mind it sha n't be the worse for me , if I can help it . They may tell me I ca n't alter the world -- that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it , and if I do n't lie and filch somebody else will . Well then , somebody else shall , for I wo n't . That 's the upshot of my conversion , Mr. Lyon , if you want to know it . '' Mr. Lyon removed his hand from Felix 's shoulder and walked about again . `` Did you sit under any preacher at Glasgow , young man ? '' `` No : I heard most of the preachers once , but I never wanted to hear them twice . '' The good Rufus was not without a slight rising of resentment at this young man 's want of reverence . It was not yet plain whether he wanted to hear twice the preacher in Malthouse Yard . But the resentful feeling was carefully repressed : a soul in so peculiar a condition must be dealt with delicately . `` And now , may I ask , '' he said , `` what course you mean to take , after hindering your mother from making and selling these drugs ? I speak no more in their favor after what you have said . God forbid that I should strive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and honorable . But your mother is advanced in years ; she needs comfortable sustenance ; you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends ? 'He that provideth not for his own -- -- ' I trust you respect the authority that so speaks . And I will not suppose that , after being tender of conscience toward strangers , you will be careless toward your mother . There be indeed some who , taking a mighty charge on their shoulder , must perforce leave their households to Providence , and to the care of humbler brethren , but in such a case the call must be clear . '' `` I shall keep my mother as well -- nay , better -- than she has kept herself . She has always been frugal . With my watch and clock cleaning , and teaching one or two little chaps that I 've got to come to me , I can earn enough . As for me , I can live on bran porridge . I have the stomach of a rhinoceros . '' `` But for a young man so well furnished as you , who can questionless write a good hand and keep books , were it not well to seek some higher situation as clerk or assistant ? I could speak to Brother Muscat , who is well acquainted with all such openings . Any place in Pendrell 's Bank , I fear , is now closed against such as are not Churchmen . It used not to be so , but a year ago he discharged Brother Bodkin , although he was a valuable servant . Still , something might be found . There are ranks and degrees -- and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly change what seems to be a providential appointment . Your poor mother is not altogether -- -- '' '' Excuse me , Mr. Lyon ; I 've had all that out with my mother , and I may as well save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up about that a long while ago . I 'll take no employment that obliges me to prop up my chin with a high cravat , and wear straps , and pass the livelong day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt pins . That sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts ; it only happens to be paid out of proportion . That 's why I set myself to learn the watchmaking trade . My father was a weaver first of all . It would have been better for him if he had remained a weaver . I came home through Lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still . I mean to stick to the class I belong to -- people who do n't follow the fashions . '' Mr. Lyon was silent a few moments . This dialogue was far from plain sailing ; he was not certain of his latitude and longitude . If the despiser of Glasgow preachers had been arguing in favor of gin and Sabbath-breaking , Mr. Lyon 's course would have been clearer . `` Well , well , '' he said , deliberately , `` it is true that St. Paul exercised the trade of tent-making , though he was learned in all the wisdom of the Rabbis . '' `` St. Paul was a wise man , '' said Felix . `` Why should I want to get into the middle class because I have some learning ? The most of the middle class are as ignorant as the working people about everything that does n't belong to their own Brummagem life . That 's how the workingmen are left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves : the best heads among them forsake their boon comrades , and go in for a house with a high door-step and a brass knocker . '' Mr. Lyon stroked his mouth and chin , perhaps because he felt some disposition to smile ; and it would not be well to smile too readily at what seemed but a weedy resemblance of Christian unworldliness . On the contrary , there might be a dangerous snare in an unsanctified outstepping of average Christian practice . `` Nevertheless , '' he observed , gravely , `` it is by such self-advancement that many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty and to the public well-being . The ring and the robe of Joseph were no objects for a good man 's ambition , but they were the signs of that credit which he won by his divinely-inspired skill , and which enabled him to act as a saviour to his brethren . '' `` Oh , yes , your ringed and scented men of the people ! -- I wo n't be one of them . Let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock , and he 'll get new wants and new motives . Metamorphosis will have begun at his neck-joint , and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and then his reasoning , which will follow his likings as the feet of a hungry dog follow his nose . I 'll have none of your clerkly gentility . I might end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine coat and a glutton 's dinner , on pretence of serving the poor men . I'd sooner be Paley 's fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach , though '' -- here Felix changed his voice a little -- '' I should like well enough to be another sort of demagogue , if I could . '' `` Then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of these times ? '' said Mr. Lyon , with a perceptible flashing of the eyes . `` I should think so . I despise every man who has not -- or , having it , does n't try to rouse it in other men . '' `` Right , my young friend , right , '' said the minister , in a deep cordial tone . Inevitably his mind was drawn aside from the immediate consideration of Felix Holt 's spiritual interest by the prospect of political sympathy . In those days so many instruments of God 's cause in the fight for religious and political liberty held creeds that were painfully wrong , and , indeed , irreconcilable with salvation ! `` That is my own view , which I maintain in the face of some opposition from brethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to the closer walk , and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their duties as members of the commonwealth . I have had much puerile blame cast upon me because I have uttered such names as Brougham and Wellington in the pulpit . Why not Wellington as well as Rabshakeh ? and why not Brougham as well as Balaam ? Does God know less of men than He did in the days of Hezekiah and Moses ? -- is His arm shortened , and is the world become too wide for His providence ? But , they say , there are no politics in the New Testament -- -- '' '' Well , they 're right enough there , '' said Felix , with his usual unceremoniousness . `` What ! you are of those who hold that a Christian minister should not meddle with public matters in the pulpit ? '' said Mr. Lyon , coloring . `` I am ready to join issue on that point . '' `` Not I , sir , '' said Felix ; `` I should say , teach any truth you can , whether it 's in the Testament or out of it . It 's little enough anybody can get hold of , and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a pence-counting , parcel-tying generation , such as mostly fill your chapels . '' `` Young man , '' said Mr. Lyon , pausing in front of Felix . He spoke rapidly , as he always did , except when his words were specially weighted with emotion : he overflowed with matter , and in his mind matter was always completely organized into words . `` I speak not on my own behalf , for not only have I no desire that any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , but I am aware of much that should make me patient under a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction . I speak not as claiming reverence for my own age and office -- not to shame you , but to warn you . It is good that you should use plainness of speech , and I am not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young , that they themselves , being elders , may be heard at large ; but Elihu was the youngest of Job 's friends , yet was there a wise rebuke in his words ; and the aged Eli was taught by a revelation to the boy Samuel . I have to keep a special watch over myself in this matter , inasmuch as I have need of utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent-up fire , until I have shot it forth , as it were , in arrowy words , each one hitting its mark . Therefore I pray for a listening spirit , which is a great mark of grace . Nevertheless , my young friend , I am bound , as I said , to warn you . The temptations that most beset those who have great natural gifts , and are wise after the flesh , are pride and scorn , more particularly toward those weak things of the world which have been chosen to confound the things which are mighty . The scornful nostril and the high head gather not the odors that lie on the track of truth . The mind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is -- -- '' Here the door opened , and Mr. Lyon paused to look around , but seeing only Lyddy with the tea-tray , he went on -- '' Is , I may say , as a clenched fist that can give blows , but is shut up from receiving and holding aught that is precious -- though it were heaven-sent manna . '' `` I understand you , sir , '' said Felix , good-humoredly , putting out his hand to the little man , who had come close to him as he delivered the last sentence with sudden emphasis and slowness . `` But I 'm not inclined to clench my fist at you . '' `` Well , well , '' said Mr. Lyon , shaking the proffered hand , `` we shall see more of each other , and I trust shall have much profitable communing . You will stay and have a dish of tea with us : we take the meal late on Thursdays , because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the French tongue . But she is doubtless returned now , and will presently come and pour out tea for us . '' `` Thank you , I 'll stay , '' said Felix , not from any curiosity to see the minister 's daughter , but from a liking for the society of the minister himself -- for his quaint looks and ways , and the transparency of his",Felix Holt The Radical
Joseph Conrad,"Some reviewers maintained that the work starting as a short story had got beyond the writer ’ s control . One or two discovered internal evidence of the fact , which seemed to amuse them . They pointed out the limitations of the narrative form . They argued that no man could have been expected to talk all that time , and other men to listen so long . It was not , they said , very credible . After thinking it over for something like sixteen years , I am not so sure about that . Men have been known , both in the tropics and in the temperate zone , to sit up half the night ‘ swapping yarns ’ . This , however , is but one yarn , yet with interruptions affording some measure of relief ; and in regard to the listeners ’ endurance , the postulate must be accepted that the story was interesting . It is the necessary preliminary assumption . If I hadn ’ t believed that it was interesting I could never have begun to write it . As to the mere physical possibility we all know that some speeches in Parliament have taken nearer six than three hours in delivery ; whereas all that part of the book which is Marlow ’ s narrative can be read through aloud , I should say , in less than three hours . Besides -- though I have kept strictly all such insignificant details out of the tale -- we may presume that there must have been refreshments on that night , a glass of mineral water of some sort to help the narrator on . But , seriously , the truth of the matter is , that my first thought was of a short story , concerned only with the pilgrim ship episode ; nothing more . And that was a legitimate conception . After writing a few pages , however , I became for some reason discontented and I laid them aside for a time . I didn ’ t take them out of the drawer till the late Mr. William Blackwood suggested I should give something again to his magazine . It was only then that I perceived that the pilgrim ship episode was a good starting-point for a free and wandering tale ; that it was an event , too , which could conceivably colour the whole ‘ sentiment of existence ’ in a simple and sensitive character . But all these preliminary moods and stirrings of spirit were rather obscure at the time , and they do not appear clearer to me now after the lapse of so many years . The few pages I had laid aside were not without their weight in the choice of subject . But the whole was re-written deliberately . When I sat down to it I knew it would be a long book , though I didn ’ t foresee that it would spread itself over thirteen numbers of Maga . I have been asked at times whether this was not the book of mine I liked best . I am a great foe to favouritism in public life , in private life , and even in the delicate relationship of an author to his works . As a matter of principle I will have no favourites ; but I don ’ t go so far as to feel grieved and annoyed by the preference some people give to my Lord Jim . I won ’ t even say that I ‘ fail to understand . . . ’ No ! But once I had occasion to be puzzled and surprised . A friend of mine returning from Italy had talked with a lady there who did not like the book . I regretted that , of course , but what surprised me was the ground of her dislike . ‘ You know , ’ she said , ‘ it is all so morbid. ’ The pronouncement gave me food for an hour ’ s anxious thought . Finally I arrived at the conclusion that , making due allowances for the subject itself being rather foreign to women ’ s normal sensibilities , the lady could not have been an Italian . I wonder whether she was European at all ? In any case , no Latin temperament would have perceived anything morbid in the acute consciousness of lost honour . Such a consciousness may be wrong , or it may be right , or it may be condemned as artificial ; and , perhaps , my Jim is not a type of wide commonness . But I can safely assure my readers that he is not the product of coldly perverted thinking . He ’ s not a figure of Northern Mists either . One sunny morning , in the commonplace surroundings of an Eastern roadstead , I saw his form pass by -- appealing -- significant -- under a cloud -- perfectly silent . Which is as it should be . It was for me , with all the sympathy of which I was capable , to seek fit words for his meaning . He was ‘ one of us ’ . J.C. 1917 . LORD JIM CHAPTER 1 He was an inch , perhaps two , under six feet , powerfully built , and he advanced straight at you with a slight stoop of the shoulders , head forward , and a fixed from-under stare which made you think of a charging bull . His voice was deep , loud , and his manner displayed a kind of dogged self-assertion which had nothing aggressive in it . It seemed a necessity , and it was directed apparently as much at himself as at anybody else . He was spotlessly neat , apparelled in immaculate white from shoes to hat , and in the various Eastern ports where he got his living as ship-chandler ’ s water-clerk he was very popular . A water-clerk need not pass an examination in anything under the sun , but he must have Ability in the abstract and demonstrate it practically . His work consists in racing under sail , steam , or oars against other water-clerks for any ship about to anchor , greeting her captain cheerily , forcing upon him a card -- the business card of the ship-chandler -- and on his first visit on shore piloting him firmly but without ostentation to a vast , cavern-like shop which is full of things that are eaten and drunk on board ship ; where you can get everything to make her seaworthy and beautiful , from a set of chain-hooks for her cable to a book of gold-leaf for the carvings of her stern ; and where her commander is received like a brother by a ship-chandler he has never seen before . There is a cool parlour , easy-chairs , bottles , cigars , writing implements , a copy of harbour regulations , and a warmth of welcome that melts the salt of a three months ’ passage out of a seaman ’ s heart . The connection thus begun is kept up , as long as the ship remains in harbour , by the daily visits of the water-clerk . To the captain he is faithful like a friend and attentive like a son , with the patience of Job , the unselfish devotion of a woman , and the jollity of a boon companion . Later on the bill is sent in . It is a beautiful and humane occupation . Therefore good water-clerks are scarce . When a water-clerk who possesses Ability in the abstract has also the advantage of having been brought up to the sea , he is worth to his employer a lot of money and some humouring . Jim had always good wages and as much humouring as would have bought the fidelity of a fiend . Nevertheless , with black ingratitude he would throw up the job suddenly and depart . To his employers the reasons he gave were obviously inadequate . They said ‘ Confounded fool ! ’ as soon as his back was turned . This was their criticism on his exquisite sensibility . To the white men in the waterside business and to the captains of ships he was just Jim -- nothing more . He had , of course , another name , but he was anxious that it should not be pronounced . His incognito , which had as many holes as a sieve , was not meant to hide a personality but a fact . When the fact broke through the incognito he would leave suddenly the seaport where he happened to be at the time and go to another -- generally farther east . He kept to seaports because he was a seaman in exile from the sea , and had Ability in the abstract , which is good for no other work but that of a water-clerk . He retreated in good order towards the rising sun , and the fact followed him casually but inevitably . Thus in the course of years he was known successively in Bombay , in Calcutta , in Rangoon , in Penang , in Batavia -- and in each of these halting-places was just Jim the water-clerk . Afterwards , when his keen perception of the Intolerable drove him away for good from seaports and white men , even into the virgin forest , the Malays of the jungle village , where he had elected to conceal his deplorable faculty , added a word to the monosyllable of his incognito . They called him Tuan Jim : as one might say -- Lord Jim . Originally he came from a parsonage . Many commanders of fine merchant-ships come from these abodes of piety and peace . Jim ’ s father possessed such certain knowledge of the Unknowable as made for the righteousness of people in cottages without disturbing the ease of mind of those whom an unerring Providence enables to live in mansions . The little church on a hill had the mossy greyness of a rock seen through a ragged screen of leaves . It had stood there for centuries , but the trees around probably remembered the laying of the first stone . Below , the red front of the rectory gleamed with a warm tint in the midst of grass-plots , flower-beds , and fir-trees , with an orchard at the back , a paved stable-yard to the left , and the sloping glass of greenhouses tacked along a wall of bricks . The living had belonged to the family for generations ; but Jim was one of five sons , and when after a course of light holiday literature his vocation for the sea had declared itself , he was sent at once to a ‘ training-ship for officers of the mercantile marine. ’ He learned there a little trigonometry and how to cross top-gallant yards . He was generally liked . He had the third place in navigation and pulled stroke in the first cutter . Having a steady head with an excellent physique , he was very smart aloft . His station was in the fore-top , and often from there he looked down , with the contempt of a man destined to shine in the midst of dangers , at the peaceful multitude of roofs cut in two by the brown tide of the stream , while scattered on the outskirts of the surrounding plain the factory chimneys rose perpendicular against a grimy sky , each slender like a pencil , and belching out smoke like a volcano . He could see the big ships departing , the broad-beamed ferries constantly on the move , the little boats floating far below his feet , with the hazy splendour of the sea in the distance , and the hope of a stirring life in the world of adventure . On the lower deck in the babel of two hundred voices he would forget himself , and beforehand live in his mind the sea-life of light literature . He saw himself saving people from sinking ships , cutting away masts in a hurricane , swimming through a surf with a line ; or as a lonely castaway , barefooted and half naked , walking on uncovered reefs in search of shellfish to stave off starvation . He confronted savages on tropical shores , quelled mutinies on the high seas , and in a small boat upon the ocean kept up the hearts of despairing men -- always an example of devotion to duty , and as unflinching as a hero in a book . ‘ Something ’ s up . Come along. ’ He leaped to his feet . The boys were streaming up the ladders . Above could be heard a great scurrying about and shouting , and when he got through the hatchway he stood still -- as if confounded . It was the dusk of a winter ’ s day . The gale had freshened since noon , stopping the traffic on the river , and now blew with the strength of a hurricane in fitful bursts that boomed like salvoes of great guns firing over the ocean . The rain slanted in sheets that flicked and subsided , and between whiles Jim had threatening glimpses of the tumbling tide , the small craft jumbled and tossing along the shore , the motionless buildings in the driving mist , the broad ferry-boats pitching ponderously at anchor , the vast landing-stages heaving up and down and smothered in sprays . The next gust seemed to blow all this away . The air was full of flying water . There was a fierce purpose in the gale , a furious earnestness in the screech of the wind , in the brutal tumult of earth and sky , that seemed directed at him , and made him hold his breath in awe . He stood still . It seemed to him he was whirled around . He was jostled . ‘ Man the cutter ! ’ Boys rushed past him . A coaster running in for shelter had crashed through a schooner at anchor , and one of the ship ’ s instructors had seen the accident . A mob of boys clambered on the rails , clustered round the davits . ‘ Collision . Just ahead of us . Mr. Symons saw it. ’ A push made him stagger against the mizzen-mast , and he caught hold of a rope . The old training-ship chained to her moorings quivered all over , bowing gently head to wind , and with her scanty rigging humming in a deep bass the breathless song of her youth at sea . ‘ Lower away ! ’ He saw the boat , manned , drop swiftly below the rail , and rushed after her . He heard a splash . ‘ Let go ; clear the falls ! ’ He leaned over . The river alongside seethed in frothy streaks . The cutter could be seen in the falling darkness under the spell of tide and wind , that for a moment held her bound , and tossing abreast of the ship . A yelling voice in her reached him faintly : ‘ Keep stroke , you young whelps , if you want to save anybody ! Keep stroke ! ’ And suddenly she lifted high her bow , and , leaping with raised oars over a wave , broke the spell cast upon her by the wind and tide . Jim felt his shoulder gripped firmly . ‘ Too late , youngster. ’ The captain of the ship laid a restraining hand on that boy , who seemed on the point of leaping overboard , and Jim looked up with the pain of conscious defeat in his eyes . The captain smiled sympathetically . ‘ Better luck next time . This will teach you to be smart. ’ A shrill cheer greeted the cutter . She came dancing back half full of water , and with two exhausted men washing about on her bottom boards . The tumult and the menace of wind and sea now appeared very contemptible to Jim , increasing the regret of his awe at their inefficient menace . Now he knew what to think of it . It seemed to him he cared nothing for the gale . He could affront greater perils . He would do so -- better than anybody . Not a particle of fear was left . Nevertheless he brooded apart that evening while the bowman of the cutter -- a boy with a face like a girl ’ s and big grey eyes -- was the hero of the lower deck . Eager questioners crowded round him . He narrated : ‘ I just saw his head bobbing , and I dashed my boat-hook in the water . It caught in his breeches and I nearly went overboard , as I thought I would , only old Symons let go the tiller and grabbed my legs -- the boat nearly swamped . Old Symons is a fine old chap . I don ’ t mind a bit him being grumpy with us . He swore at me all the time he held my leg , but that was only his way of telling me to stick to the boat-hook . Old Symons is awfully excitable -- isn ’ t he ? No -- not the little fair chap -- the other , the big one with a beard . When we pulled him in he groaned , “ Oh , my leg ! oh , my leg ! ” and turned up his eyes . Fancy such a big chap fainting like a girl . Would any of you fellows faint for a jab with a boat-hook ? -- I wouldn ’ t . It went into his leg so far. ’ He showed the boat-hook , which he had carried below for the purpose , and produced a sensation . ‘ No , silly ! It was not his flesh that held him -- his breeches did . Lots of blood , of course. ’ Jim thought it a pitiful display of vanity . The gale had ministered to a heroism as spurious as its own pretence of terror . He felt angry with the brutal tumult of earth and sky for taking him unawares and checking unfairly a generous readiness for narrow escapes . Otherwise he was rather glad he had not gone into the cutter , since a lower achievement had served the turn . He had enlarged his knowledge more than those who had done the work . When all men flinched , then -- he felt sure -- he alone would know how to deal with the spurious menace of wind and seas . He knew what to think of it . Seen dispassionately , it seemed contemptible . He could detect no trace of emotion in himself , and the final effect of a staggering event was that , unnoticed and apart from the noisy crowd of boys , he exulted with fresh certitude in his avidity for adventure , and in a sense of many-sided courage . CHAPTER 2 After two years of training he went to sea , and entering the regions so well known to his imagination , found them strangely barren of adventure . He made many voyages . He knew the magic monotony of existence between sky and water : he had to bear the criticism of men , the exactions of the sea , and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread -- but whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work . This reward eluded him . Yet he could not go back , because there is nothing more enticing , disenchanting , and enslaving than the life at sea . Besides , his prospects were good . He was gentlemanly , steady , tractable , with a thorough knowledge of his duties ; and in time , when yet very young , he became chief mate of a fine ship , without ever having been tested by those events of the sea that show in the light of day the inner worth of a man , the edge of his temper , and the fibre of his stuff ; that reveal the quality of his resistance and the secret truth of his pretences , not only to others but also to himself . Only once in all that time he had again a glimpse of the earnestness in the anger of the sea . That truth is not so often made apparent as people might think . There are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales , and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intention -- that indefinable something which forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man , that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice , with a strength beyond control , with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and his fear , the pain of his fatigue and his longing for rest : which means to smash , to destroy , to annihilate all he has seen , known , loved , enjoyed , or hated ; all that is priceless and necessary -- the sunshine , the memories , the future ; which means to sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by the simple and appalling act of taking his life . Jim , disabled by a falling spar at the beginning of a week of which his Scottish captain used to say afterwards , ‘ Man ! it ’ s a pairfect meeracle to me how she lived through it ! ’ spent many days stretched on his back , dazed , battered , hopeless , and tormented as if at the bottom of an abyss of unrest . He did not care what the end would be , and in his lucid moments overvalued his indifference . The danger , when not seen , has the imperfect vagueness of human thought . The fear grows shadowy ; and Imagination , the enemy of men , the father of all terrors , unstimulated , sinks to rest in the dullness of exhausted emotion . Jim saw nothing but the disorder of his tossed cabin . He lay there battened down in the midst of a small devastation , and felt secretly glad he had not to go on deck . But now and again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip him bodily , make him gasp and writhe under the blankets , and then the unintelligent brutality of an existence liable to the agony of such sensations filled him with a despairing desire to escape at any cost . Then fine weather returned , and he thought no more about It . His lameness , however , persisted , and when the ship arrived at an Eastern port he had to go to the hospital . His recovery was slow , and he was left behind . There were only two other patients in the white men ’ s ward : the purser of a gunboat , who had broken his leg falling down a hatchway ; and a kind of railway contractor from a neighbouring province , afflicted by some mysterious tropical disease , who held the doctor for an ass , and indulged in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which his Tamil servant used to smuggle in with unwearied devotion . They told each other the story of their lives , played cards a little , or , yawning and in pyjamas , lounged through the day in easy-chairs without saying a word . The hospital stood on a hill , and a gentle breeze entering through the windows , always flung wide open , brought into the bare room the softness of the sky , the languor of the earth , the bewitching breath of the Eastern waters . There were perfumes in it , suggestions of infinite repose , the gift of endless dreams . Jim looked every day over the thickets of gardens , beyond the roofs of the town , over the fronds of palms growing on the shore , at that roadstead which is a thoroughfare to the East , -- at the roadstead dotted by garlanded islets , lighted by festal sunshine , its ships like toys , its brilliant activity resembling a holiday pageant , with the eternal serenity of the Eastern sky overhead and the smiling peace of the Eastern seas possessing the space as far as the horizon . Directly he could walk without a stick , he descended into the town to look for some opportunity to get home . Nothing offered just then , and , while waiting , he associated naturally with the men of his calling in the port . These were of two kinds . Some , very few and seen there but seldom , led mysterious lives , had preserved an undefaced energy with the temper of buccaneers and the eyes of dreamers . They appeared to live in a crazy maze of plans , hopes , dangers , enterprises , ahead of civilisation , in the dark places of the sea ; and their death was the only event of their fantastic existence that seemed to have a reasonable certitude of achievement . The majority were men who , like himself , thrown there by some accident , had remained as officers of country ships . They had now a horror of the home service , with its harder conditions , severer view of duty , and the hazard of stormy oceans . They were attuned to the eternal peace of Eastern sky and sea . They loved short passages , good deck-chairs , large native crews , and the distinction of being white . They shuddered at the thought of hard work , and led precariously easy lives , always on the verge of dismissal , always on the verge of engagement , serving Chinamen , Arabs , half-castes -- would have served the devil himself had he made it easy enough . They talked everlastingly of turns of luck : how So-and-so got charge of a boat on the coast of China -- a soft thing ; how this one had an easy billet in Japan somewhere , and that one was doing well in the Siamese navy ; and in all they said -- in their actions , in their looks , in their persons -- could be detected the soft spot , the place of decay , the determination to lounge safely through existence . To Jim that gossiping crowd , viewed as seamen , seemed at first more unsubstantial than so many shadows . But at length he found a fascination in the sight of those men , in their appearance of doing so well on such a small allowance of danger and toil . In time , beside the original disdain there grew up slowly another sentiment ; and suddenly , giving up the idea of going home , he took a berth as chief mate of the Patna . The Patna was a local steamer as old as the hills , lean like a greyhound , and eaten up with rust worse than a condemned water-tank . She was owned by a Chinaman , chartered by an Arab , and commanded by a sort of renegade New South Wales German , very anxious to curse publicly his native country , but who , apparently on the strength of Bismarck ’ s victorious policy , brutalised all those he was not afraid of , and wore a ‘ blood-and-iron ’ air , ’ combined with a purple nose and a red moustache . After she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside , eight hundred pilgrims ( more or less ) were driven on board of her as she lay with steam up alongside a wooden jetty . They streamed aboard over three gangways , they streamed in urged by faith and the hope of paradise , they streamed in with a continuous tramp and shuffle of bare feet , without a word , a murmur , or a look back ; and when clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck , flowed forward and aft , overflowed down the yawning hatchways , filled the inner recesses of the ship -- like water filling a cistern , like water flowing into crevices and crannies , like water rising silently even with the rim . Eight hundred men and women with faith and hopes , with affections and memories , they had collected there , coming from north and south and from the outskirts of the East , after treading the jungle paths , descending the rivers , coasting in praus along the shallows , crossing in small canoes from island to island , passing through suffering , meeting strange sights , beset by strange fears , upheld by one desire . They came from solitary huts in the wilderness , from populous campongs , from villages by the sea . At the call of an idea they had left their forests , their clearings , the protection of their rulers , their prosperity , their poverty , the surroundings of their youth and the graves of their fathers . They came covered with dust , with sweat , with grime , with rags -- the strong men at the head of family parties , the lean old men pressing forward without hope of return ; young boys with fearless eyes glancing curiously , shy little girls with tumbled long hair ; the timid women muffled up and clasping to their breasts , wrapped in loose ends of soiled head-cloths , their sleeping babies , the unconscious pilgrims of an exacting belief . ‘ Look at dese cattle , ’ said the German skipper to his new chief mate . An Arab , the leader of that pious voyage , came last . He walked slowly aboard , handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban . A string of servants followed , loaded with his luggage ; the Patna cast off and backed away from the wharf . She was headed between two small islets , crossed obliquely the anchoring-ground of sailing-ships , swung through half a circle in the shadow of a hill , then ranged close to a ledge of foaming reefs . The Arab , standing up aft , recited aloud the prayer of travellers by sea . He invoked the favour of the Most High upon that journey , implored His blessing on men ’ s toil and on the secret purposes of their hearts ; the steamer pounded in the dusk the calm water of the Strait ; and far astern of the pilgrim ship a screw-pile lighthouse , planted by unbelievers on a treacherous shoal , seemed to wink at her its eye of flame , as if in derision of her errand of faith . She cleared the Strait , crossed the bay , continued on her way through the ‘ One-degree ’ passage . She held on straight for the Red Sea under a serene sky , under a sky scorching and unclouded , enveloped in a fulgor of sunshine that killed all thought , oppressed the heart , withered all impulses of strength and energy . And under the sinister splendour of that sky the sea , blue and profound , remained still , without a stir , without a ripple , without a wrinkle -- viscous , stagnant , dead . The Patna , with a slight hiss , passed over that plain , luminous and smooth , unrolled a black ribbon of smoke across the sky , left behind her on the water a white ribbon of foam that vanished at once , like the phantom of a track drawn upon a lifeless sea by the phantom of a steamer . Every morning the sun , as if keeping pace in his revolutions with the progress of the pilgrimage , emerged with a silent burst of light exactly at the same distance astern of the ship , caught up with her at noon , pouring the concentrated fire of his rays on the pious purposes of the men , glided past on his descent , and sank mysteriously into the sea evening after evening , preserving the same distance ahead of her advancing bows . The five whites on board lived amidships , isolated from the human cargo . The awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern , and a faint hum , a low murmur of sad voices , alone revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean . Such were the days , still , hot , heavy , disappearing one by one into the past , as if falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake of the ship ; and the ship , lonely under a wisp of smoke , held on her steadfast way black and smouldering in a luminous immensity , as if scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity . The nights descended on her like a benediction . CHAPTER 3 A marvellous stillness pervaded the world , and the stars , together with the serenity of their rays , seemed to shed upon the earth the assurance of everlasting security . The young moon recurved , and shining low in the west , was like a slender shaving thrown up from a bar of gold , and the Arabian Sea , smooth and cool to the eye like a sheet of ice , extended its perfect level to the perfect circle of a dark horizon . The propeller turned without a check , as though its beat had been part of the scheme of a safe universe ; and on each side of the Patna two deep folds of water , permanent and sombre on the unwrinkled shimmer , enclosed within their straight and diverging ridges a few white swirls of foam bursting in a low hiss , a few wavelets , a few ripples , a few undulations that , left behind , agitated the surface of the sea for an instant after the passage of the ship , subsided splashing gently , calmed down at last into the circular stillness of water and sky with the black speck of the moving hull remaining everlastingly in its centre . Jim on the bridge was penetrated by the great certitude of unbounded safety and peace that could be read on the silent aspect of nature like the certitude of fostering love upon the placid tenderness of a mother ’ s face . Below the roof of awnings , surrendered to the wisdom of white men and to their courage , trusting the power of their unbelief and the iron shell of their fire-ship , the pilgrims of an exacting faith slept on mats , on blankets , on bare planks , on every deck , in all the dark corners , wrapped in dyed cloths , muffled in soiled rags , with their heads resting on small bundles , with their faces pressed to bent forearms : the men , the women , the children ; the old with the young , the decrepit with the lusty -- all equal before sleep , death ’ s brother . A draught of air , fanned from forward by the speed of the ship , passed steadily through the long gloom between the high bulwarks , swept over the rows of prone bodies ; a few dim flames in globe-lamps were hung short here and there under the ridge-poles , and in the blurred circles of light thrown down and trembling slightly to the unceasing vibration of the ship appeared a chin upturned , two closed eyelids , a dark hand with silver rings , a meagre limb draped in a torn covering , a head bent back , a naked foot , a throat bared and stretched as if offering itself to the knife . The well-to-do had made for their families shelters with heavy boxes and dusty mats ; the poor reposed side by side with all they had on earth tied up in a rag under their heads ; the lone old men slept , with drawn-up legs , upon their prayer-carpets , with their hands over their ears and one elbow on each side of the face ; a father , his shoulders up and his knees under his forehead , dozed dejectedly by a boy who slept on his back with tousled hair and one arm commandingly extended ; a woman covered from head to foot , like a corpse , with a piece of white sheeting , had a naked child in the hollow of each arm ; the Arab ’ s belongings , piled right aft , made a heavy mound of broken outlines , with a cargo-lamp swung above , and a great confusion of vague forms behind : gleams of paunchy brass pots , the foot-rest of a deck-chair , blades of spears , the straight scabbard of an old sword leaning against a heap of pillows , the spout of a tin coffee-pot . The patent log on the taffrail periodically rang a single tinkling stroke for every mile traversed on an errand of faith . Above the mass of sleepers a faint and patient sigh at times floated , the exhalation of a troubled dream ; and short metallic clangs bursting out suddenly in the depths of the ship , the harsh scrape of a shovel , the violent slam of a furnace-door , exploded brutally , as if the men handling the mysterious things below had their breasts full of fierce anger : while the slim high hull of the steamer went on evenly ahead , without a sway of her bare masts , cleaving continuously the great calm of the waters under the inaccessible serenity of the sky . Jim paced athwart , and his footsteps in the vast silence were loud to his own ears , as if echoed by the watchful stars : his eyes , roaming about the line of the horizon , seemed to gaze hungrily into the unattainable , and did not see the shadow of the coming event . The only shadow on the sea was the shadow of the black smoke pouring heavily from the funnel its immense streamer , whose end was constantly dissolving in the air . Two Malays , silent and almost motionless , steered , one on each side of the wheel , whose brass rim shone fragmentarily in the oval of light thrown out by the binnacle . Now and then a hand , with black fingers alternately letting go and catching hold of revolving spokes , appeared in the illumined part ; the links of wheel-chains ground heavily in the grooves of the barrel . Jim would glance at the compass , would glance around the unattainable horizon , would stretch himself till his joints cracked , with a leisurely twist of the body , in the very excess of well-being ; and , as if made audacious by the invincible aspect of the peace , he felt he cared for nothing that could happen to him to the end of his days . From time to time he glanced idly at a chart pegged out with four drawing-pins on a low three-legged table abaft the steering-gear case . The sheet of paper portraying the depths of the sea presented a shiny surface under the light of a bull ’ s-eye lamp lashed to a stanchion , a surface as level and smooth as the glimmering surface of the waters . Parallel rulers with a pair of dividers reposed on it ; the ship ’ s position at last noon was marked with a small black cross , and the straight pencil-line drawn firmly as far as Perim figured the course of the ship -- the path of souls towards the holy place , the promise of salvation , the reward of eternal life -- while the pencil with its sharp end touching the Somali coast lay round and still like a naked ship ’ s spar floating in the pool of a sheltered dock . ‘ How steady she goes , ’ thought Jim with wonder , with something like gratitude for this high peace of sea and sky . At such times his thoughts would be full of valorous deeds : he loved these dreams and the success of his imaginary achievements . They were the best parts of life , its secret truth , its hidden reality . They had a gorgeous virility , the charm of vagueness , they passed before him with an heroic tread ; they carried his soul away with them and made it drunk with the divine philtre of an unbounded confidence in itself . There was nothing he could not face . He was so pleased with the idea that he smiled , keeping perfunctorily his eyes ahead ; and when he happened to glance back he saw the white streak of the wake drawn as straight by the ship ’ s keel upon the sea as the black line drawn by the pencil upon the chart . The ash-buckets racketed , clanking up and down the stoke-hold ventilators , and this tin-pot clatter warned him the end of his watch was near . He sighed with content , with regret as well at having to part from that serenity which fostered the adventurous freedom of his thoughts . He was a little sleepy too , and felt a pleasurable languor running through every limb as though all the blood in his body had turned to warm milk . His skipper had come up noiselessly , in pyjamas and with his sleeping-jacket flung wide open . Red of face , only half awake , the left eye partly closed , the right staring stupid and glassy , he hung his big head over the chart and scratched his ribs sleepily . There was something obscene in the sight of his naked flesh . His bared breast glistened soft and greasy as though he had sweated out his fat in his sleep . He pronounced a professional remark in a voice harsh and dead , resembling the rasping sound of a wood-file on the edge of a plank ; the fold of his double chin hung like a bag triced up close under the hinge of his jaw . Jim started , and his answer was full of deference ; but the odious and fleshy figure , as though seen for the first time in a revealing moment , fixed itself in his memory for ever as the incarnation of everything vile and base that lurks in the world we love : in our own hearts we trust for our salvation , in the men that surround us , in the sights that fill our eyes , in the sounds that fill our ears , and in the air that fills our lungs . The thin gold shaving of the moon floating slowly downwards had lost itself on the darkened surface of the waters , and the eternity beyond the sky seemed to come down nearer to the earth , with the augmented glitter of the stars , with the more profound sombreness in the lustre of the half-transparent dome covering the flat disc of an opaque sea . The ship moved so smoothly that her onward motion was imperceptible to the senses of men , as though she had been a crowded planet speeding through the dark spaces of ether behind the swarm of suns , in the appalling and calm solitudes awaiting the breath of future creations . ‘ Hot is no name for it down below , ’ said a voice . Jim smiled without looking round . The skipper presented an unmoved breadth of back : it was the renegade ’ s trick to appear pointedly unaware of your existence unless it suited his purpose to turn at you with a devouring glare before he let loose a torrent of foamy , abusive jargon that came like a gush from a sewer . Now he emitted only a sulky grunt ; the second engineer at the head of the bridge-ladder , kneading with damp palms a dirty sweat-rag , unabashed , continued the tale of his complaints . The sailors had a good time of it up here , and what was the use of them in the world he would be blowed if he could see . The poor devils of engineers had to get the ship along anyhow , and they could very well do the rest too ; by gosh they -- ‘ Shut up ! ’ growled the German stolidly . ‘ Oh yes ! Shut up -- and when anything goes wrong you fly to us , don ’ t you ? ’ went on the other . He was more than half cooked , he expected ; but anyway , now , he did not mind how much he sinned , because these last three days he had passed through a fine course of training for the place where the bad boys go when they die -- b ’ gosh , he had -- besides being made jolly well deaf by the blasted racket below . The durned , compound , surface-condensing , rotten scrap-heap rattled and banged down there like an old deck-winch , only more so ; and what made him risk his life every night and day that God made amongst the refuse of a breaking-up yard flying round at fifty-seven revolutions , was more than _he_ could tell . He must have been born reckless , b ’ gosh . He . . . ‘ Where did you get drink ? ’ inquired the German , very savage ; but motionless in the light of the binnacle , like a clumsy effigy of a man cut out of a block of fat . Jim went on smiling at the retreating horizon ; his heart was full of generous impulses , and his thought was contemplating his own superiority . ‘ Drink ! ’ repeated the engineer with amiable scorn : he was hanging on with both hands to the rail , a shadowy figure with flexible legs . ‘ Not from you , captain . You ’ re far too mean , b ’ gosh . You would let a good man die sooner than give him a drop of schnapps . That ’ s what you Germans call economy . Penny wise , pound foolish. ’ He became sentimental . The chief had given him a four-finger nip about ten o ’ clock -- ‘ only one , s ’ elp me ! ’ -- good old chief ; but as to getting the old fraud out of his bunk -- a five-ton crane couldn ’ t do it . Not it . Not to-night anyhow . He was sleeping sweetly like a little child , with a bottle of prime brandy under his pillow . From the thick throat of the commander of the Patna came a low rumble , on which the sound of the word schwein fluttered high and low like a capricious feather in a faint stir of air . He and the chief engineer had been cronies for a good few years -- serving the same jovial , crafty , old Chinaman , with horn-rimmed goggles and strings of red silk plaited into the venerable grey hairs of his pigtail . The quay-side opinion in the Patna ’ s home-port was that these two in the way of brazen peculation ‘ had done together pretty well everything you can think of. ’ Outwardly they were badly matched : one dull-eyed , malevolent , and of soft fleshy curves ; the other lean , all hollows , with a head long and bony like the head of an old horse , with sunken cheeks , with sunken temples , with an indifferent glazed glance of sunken eyes . He had been stranded out East somewhere -- in Canton , in Shanghai , or perhaps in Yokohama ; he probably did not care to remember himself the exact locality , nor yet the cause of his shipwreck . He had been , in mercy to his youth , kicked quietly out of his ship twenty years ago or more , and it might have been so much worse for him that the memory of the episode had in it hardly a trace of misfortune . Then , steam navigation expanding in these seas and men of his craft being scarce at first , he had ‘ got on ’ after a sort . He was eager to let strangers know in a dismal mumble that he was ‘ an old stager out here. ’ When he moved , a skeleton seemed to sway loose in his clothes ; his walk was mere wandering , and he was given to wander thus around the engine-room skylight , smoking , without relish , doctored tobacco in a brass bowl at the end of a cherrywood stem four feet long , with the imbecile gravity of a thinker evolving a system of philosophy from the hazy glimpse of a truth . He was usually anything but free with his private store of liquor ; but on that night he had departed from his principles , so that his second , a weak-headed child of Wapping , what with the unexpectedness of the treat and the strength of the stuff , had become very happy , cheeky , and talkative . The fury of the New South Wales German was extreme ; he puffed like an exhaust-pipe , and Jim , faintly amused by the scene , was impatient for the time when he could get below : the last ten minutes of the watch were irritating like a gun that hangs fire ; those men did not belong to the world of heroic adventure ; they weren ’ t bad chaps though . Even the skipper himself . . . His gorge rose at the mass of panting flesh from which issued gurgling mutters , a cloudy trickle of filthy expressions ; but he was too pleasurably languid to dislike actively this or any other thing . The quality of these men did not matter ; he rubbed shoulders with them , but they could not touch him ; he shared the air they breathed , but he was different . . . . Would the skipper go for the engineer ? . . . The life was easy and he was too sure of himself -- too sure of himself to . . . The line dividing his meditation from a surreptitious doze on his feet was thinner than a thread in a spider ’ s web . The second engineer was coming by easy transitions to the consideration of his finances and of his courage . ‘ Who ’ s drunk ? I ? No , no , captain ! That won ’ t do . You ought to know by this time the chief ain ’ t free-hearted enough to make a sparrow drunk , b ’ gosh . I ’ ve never been the worse for liquor in my life ; the stuff ain ’ t made yet that would make _me_ drunk . I could drink liquid fire against your whisky peg for peg , b ’ gosh , and keep as cool as a cucumber . If I thought I was drunk I would jump overboard -- do away with myself , b ’ gosh . I would ! Straight ! And I won ’ t go off the bridge . Where do you expect me to take the air on a night like this , eh ? On deck amongst that vermin down there ? Likely -- ain ’ t it ! And I am not afraid of anything you can do. ’ The German lifted two heavy fists to heaven and shook them a little without a word . ‘ I don ’ t know what fear is , ’ pursued the engineer , with the enthusiasm of sincere conviction . ‘ I am not afraid of doing all the bloomin ’ work in this rotten hooker , b ’ gosh ! And a jolly good thing for you that there are some of us about the world that aren ’ t afraid of their lives , or where would you be -- you and this old thing here with her plates like brown paper -- brown paper , s ’ elp me ? It ’ s all very fine for you -- you get a power of pieces out of her one way and another ; but what about me -- what do I get ? A measly hundred and fifty dollars a month and find yourself . I wish to ask you respectfully -- respectfully , mind -- who wouldn ’ t chuck a dratted job like this ? ‘ Tain ’ t safe , s ’ elp me , it ain ’ t ! Only I am one of them fearless fellows . . . ’ He let go the rail and made ample gestures as if demonstrating in the air the shape and extent of his valour ; his thin voice darted in prolonged squeaks upon the sea , he tiptoed back and forth for the better emphasis of utterance , and suddenly pitched down head-first as though he had been clubbed from behind . He said ‘ Damn ! ’ as he tumbled ; an instant of silence followed upon his screeching : Jim and the skipper staggered forward by common accord , and catching themselves up , stood very stiff and still gazing , amazed , at the undisturbed level of the sea . Then they looked upwards at the stars . What had happened ? The wheezy thump of the engines went on . Had the earth been checked in her course ? They could not understand ; and suddenly the calm sea , the sky without a cloud , appeared formidably insecure in their immobility , as if poised on the brow of yawning destruction . The engineer rebounded vertically full length and collapsed again into a vague heap . This heap said ‘ What ’ s that ? ’ in the muffled accents of profound grief . A faint noise as of thunder , of thunder infinitely remote , less than a sound , hardly more than a vibration , passed slowly , and the ship quivered in response , as if the thunder had growled deep down in the water . The eyes of the two Malays at the wheel glittered towards the white men , but their dark hands remained closed on the spokes . The sharp hull driving on its way seemed to rise a few inches in succession through its whole length , as though it had become pliable , and settled down again rigidly to its work of cleaving the smooth surface of the sea . Its quivering stopped , and the faint noise of thunder ceased all at once , as though the ship had steamed across a narrow belt of vibrating water and of humming air . CHAPTER 4 A month or so afterwards , when Jim , in answer to pointed questions , tried to tell honestly the truth of this experience , he said , speaking of the ship : ‘ She went over whatever it was as easy as a snake crawling over a stick. ’ The illustration was good : the questions were aiming at facts , and the official Inquiry was being held in the police court of an Eastern port . He stood elevated in the witness-box , with burning cheeks in a cool lofty room : the big framework of punkahs moved gently to and fro high above his head , and from below many eyes were looking at him out of dark faces , out of white faces , out of red faces , out of faces attentive , spellbound , as if all these people sitting in orderly rows upon narrow benches had been enslaved by the fascination of his voice . It was very loud , it rang startling in his own ears , it was the only sound audible in the world , for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast , -- came to him poignant and silent like the terrible questioning of one ’ s conscience . Outside the court the sun blazed -- within was the wind of great punkahs that made you shiver , the shame that made you burn , the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed . The face of the presiding magistrate , clean shaved and impassible , looked at him deadly pale between the red faces of the two nautical assessors . The light of a broad window under the ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men , and they were fiercely distinct in the half-light of the big court-room where the audience seemed composed of staring shadows . They wanted facts . Facts ! They demanded facts from him , as if facts could explain anything ! ‘ After you had concluded you had collided with something floating awash , say a water-logged wreck , you were ordered by your captain to go forward and ascertain if there was any damage done . Did you think it likely from the force of the blow ? ’ asked the assessor sitting to the left . He had a thin horseshoe beard , salient cheek-bones , and with both elbows on the desk clasped his rugged hands before his face , looking at Jim with thoughtful blue eyes ; the other , a heavy , scornful man , thrown back in his seat , his left arm extended full length , drummed delicately with his finger-tips on a blotting-pad : in the middle the magistrate upright in the roomy arm-chair , his head inclined slightly on the shoulder , had his arms crossed on his breast and a few flowers in a glass vase by the side of his inkstand . ‘ I did not , ’ said Jim . ‘ I was told to call no one and to make no noise for fear of creating a panic . I thought the precaution reasonable . I took one of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward . After opening the forepeak hatch I heard splashing in there . I lowered then the lamp the whole drift of its lanyard , and saw that the forepeak was more than half full of water already . I knew then there must be a big hole below the water-line. ’ He paused . ‘ Yes , ’ said the big assessor , with a dreamy smile at the blotting-pad ; his fingers played incessantly , touching the paper without noise . ‘ I did not think of danger just then . I might have been a little startled : all this happened in such a quiet way and so very suddenly . I knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating the forepeak from the forehold . I went back to tell the captain . I came upon the second engineer getting up at the foot of the bridge-ladder : he seemed dazed , and told me he thought his left arm was broken ; he had slipped on the top step when getting down while I was forward . He exclaimed , “ My God ! That rotten bulkhead ’ ll give way in a minute , and the damned thing will go down under us like a lump of lead. ” He pushed me away with his right arm and ran before me up the ladder , shouting as he climbed . His left arm hung by his side . I followed up in time to see the captain rush at him and knock him down flat on his back . He did not strike him again : he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low . I fancy he was asking him why the devil he didn ’ t go and stop the engines , instead of making a row about it on deck . I heard him say , “ Get up ! Run ! fly ! ” He swore also . The engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine-room companion which was on the port side . He moaned as he ran . . . . ’ He spoke slowly ; he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness ; he could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the better information of these men who wanted facts . After his first feeling of revolt he had come round to the view that only a meticulous precision of statement would bring out the true horror behind the appalling face of things . The facts those men were so eager to know had been visible , tangible , open to the senses , occupying their place in space and time , requiring for their existence a fourteen-hundred-ton steamer and twenty-seven minutes by the watch ; they made a whole that had features , shades of expression , a complicated aspect that could be remembered by the eye , and something else besides , something invisible , a directing spirit of perdition that dwelt within , like a malevolent soul in a detestable body . He was anxious to make this clear . This had not been a common affair , everything in it had been of the utmost importance , and fortunately he remembered everything . He wanted to go on talking for truth ’ s sake , perhaps for his own sake also ; and while his utterance was deliberate , his mind positively flew round and round the serried circle of facts that had surged up all about him to cut him off from the rest of his kind : it was like a creature that , finding itself imprisoned within an enclosure of high stakes , dashes round and round , distracted in the night , trying to find a weak spot , a crevice , a place to scale , some opening through which it may squeeze itself and escape . This awful activity of mind made him hesitate at times in his speech . . . . ‘ The captain kept on moving here and there on the bridge ; he seemed calm enough , only he stumbled several times ; and once as I stood speaking to him he walked right into me as though he had been stone-blind . He made no definite answer to what I had to tell . He mumbled to himself ; all I heard of it were a few words that sounded like “ confounded steam ! ” and “ infernal steam ! ” -- something about steam . I thought . . . ’ He was becoming irrelevant ; a question to the point cut short his speech , like a pang of pain , and he felt extremely discouraged and weary . He was coming to that , he was coming to that -- and now , checked brutally , he had to answer by yes or no . He answered truthfully by a curt ‘ Yes , I did ’ ; and fair of face , big of frame , with young , gloomy eyes , he held his shoulders upright above the box while his soul writhed within him . He was made to answer another question so much to the point and so useless , then waited again . His mouth was tastelessly dry , as though he had been eating dust , then salt and bitter as after a drink of sea-water . He wiped his damp forehead , passed his tongue over parched lips , felt a shiver run down his back . The big assessor had dropped his eyelids , and drummed on without a sound , careless and mournful ; the eyes of the other above the sunburnt , clasped fingers seemed to glow with kindliness ; the magistrate had swayed forward ; his pale face hovered near the flowers , and then dropping sideways over the arm of his chair , he rested his temple in the palm of his hand . The wind of the punkahs eddied down on the heads , on the dark-faced natives wound about in voluminous draperies , on the Europeans sitting together very hot and in drill suits that seemed to fit them as close as their skins , and holding their round pith hats on their knees ; while gliding along the walls the court peons , buttoned tight in long white coats , flitted rapidly to and fro , running on bare toes , red-sashed , red turban on head , as noiseless as ghosts , and on the alert like so many retrievers . Jim ’ s eyes , wandering in the intervals of his answers , rested upon a white man who sat apart from the others , with his face worn and clouded , but with quiet eyes that glanced straight , interested and clear . Jim answered another question and was tempted to cry out , ‘ What ’ s the good of this ! what ’ s the good ! ’ He tapped with his foot slightly , bit his lip , and looked away over the heads . He met the eyes of the white man . The glance directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others . It was an act of intelligent volition . Jim between two questions forgot himself so far as to find leisure for a thought . This fellow -- ran the thought -- looks at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder . He had come across that man before -- in the street perhaps . He was positive he had never spoken to him . For days , for many days , he had spoken to no one , but had held silent , incoherent , and endless converse with himself , like a prisoner alone in his cell or like a wayfarer lost in a wilderness . At present he was answering questions that did not matter though they had a purpose , but he doubted whether he would ever again speak out as long as he lived . The sound of his own truthful statements confirmed his deliberate opinion that speech was of no use to him any longer . That man there seemed to be aware of his hopeless difficulty . Jim looked at him , then turned away resolutely , as after a final parting . And later on , many times , in distant parts of the world , Marlow showed himself willing to remember Jim , to remember him at length , in detail and audibly . Perhaps it would be after dinner , on a verandah draped in motionless foliage and crowned with flowers , in the deep dusk speckled by fiery cigar-ends . The elongated bulk of each cane-chair harboured a silent listener . Now and then a small red glow would move abruptly , and expanding light up the fingers of a languid hand , part of a face in profound repose , or flash a crimson gleam into a pair of pensive eyes overshadowed by a fragment of an unruffled forehead ; and with the very first word uttered Marlow ’ s body , extended at rest in the seat , would become very still , as though his spirit had winged its way back into the lapse of time and were speaking through his lips from the past . CHAPTER 5 ‘ Oh yes . I attended the inquiry , ’ he would say , ‘ and to this day I haven ’ t left off wondering why I went . I am willing to believe each of us has a guardian angel , if you fellows will concede to me that each of us has a familiar devil as well . I want you to own up , because I don ’ t like to feel exceptional in any way , and I know I have him -- the devil , I mean . I haven ’ t seen him , of course , but I go upon circumstantial evidence . He is there right enough , and , being malicious , he lets me in for that kind of thing . What kind of thing , you ask ? Why , the inquiry thing , the yellow-dog thing -- you wouldn ’ t think a mangy , native tyke would be allowed to trip up people in the verandah of a magistrate ’ s court , would you ? -- the kind of thing that by devious , unexpected , truly diabolical ways causes me to run up against men with soft spots , with hard spots , with hidden plague spots , by Jove ! and loosens their tongues at the sight of me for their infernal confidences ; as though , forsooth , I had no confidences to make to myself , as though -- God help me ! -- I didn ’ t have enough confidential information about myself to harrow my own soul till the end of my appointed time . And what I have done to be thus favoured I want to know . I declare I am as full of my own concerns as the next man , and I have as much memory as the average pilgrim in this valley , so you see I am not particularly fit to be a receptacle of confessions . Then why ? Can ’ t tell -- unless it be to make time pass away after dinner . Charley , my dear chap , your dinner was extremely good , and in consequence these men here look upon a quiet rubber as a tumultuous occupation . They wallow in your good chairs and think to themselves , “ Hang exertion . Let that Marlow talk. ” ‘ Talk ? So be it . And it ’ s easy enough to talk of Master Jim , after a good spread , two hundred feet above the sea-level , with a box of decent cigars handy , on a blessed evening of freshness and starlight that would make the best of us forget we are only on sufferance here and got to pick our way in cross lights , watching every precious minute and every irremediable step , trusting we shall manage yet to go out decently in the end -- but not so sure of it after all -- and with dashed little help to expect from those we touch elbows with right and left . Of course there are men here and there to whom the whole of life is like an after-dinner hour with a cigar ; easy , pleasant , empty , perhaps enlivened by some fable of strife to be forgotten before the end is told -- before the end is told -- even if there happens to be any end to it . ‘ My eyes met his for the first time at that inquiry . You must know that everybody connected in any way with the sea was there , because the affair had been notorious for days , ever since that mysterious cable message came from Aden to start us all cackling . I say mysterious , because it was so in a sense though it contained a naked fact , about as naked and ugly as a fact can well be . The whole waterside talked of nothing else . First thing in the morning as I was dressing in my state-room , I would hear through the bulkhead my Parsee Dubash jabbering about the Patna with the steward , while he drank a cup of tea , by favour , in the pantry . No sooner on shore I would meet some acquaintance , and the first remark would be , “ Did you ever hear of anything to beat this ? ” and according to his kind the man would smile cynically , or look sad , or let out a swear or two . Complete strangers would accost each other familiarly , just for the sake of easing their minds on the subject : every confounded loafer in the town came in for a harvest of drinks over this affair : you heard of it in the harbour office , at every ship-broker ’ s , at your agent ’ s , from whites , from natives , from half-castes , from the very boatmen squatting half naked on the stone steps as you went up -- by Jove ! There was some indignation , not a few jokes , and no end of discussions as to what had become of them , you know . This went on for a couple of weeks or more , and the opinion that whatever was mysterious in this affair would turn out to be tragic as well , began to prevail , when one fine morning , as I was standing in the shade by the steps of the harbour office , I perceived four men walking towards me along the quay . I wondered for a while where that queer lot had sprung from , and suddenly , I may say , I shouted to myself , “ Here they are ! ” ‘ There they were , sure enough , three of them as large as life , and one much larger of girth than any living man has a right to be , just landed with a good breakfast inside of them from an outward-bound Dale Line steamer that had come in about an hour after sunrise . There could be no mistake ; I spotted the jolly skipper of the Patna at the first glance : the fattest man in the whole blessed tropical belt clear round that good old earth of ours . Moreover , nine months or so before , I had come across him in Samarang . His steamer was loading in the Roads , and he was abusing the tyrannical institutions of the German empire , and soaking himself in beer all day long and day after day in De Jongh ’ s back-shop , till De Jongh , who charged a guilder for every bottle without as much as the quiver of an eyelid , would beckon me aside , and , with his little leathery face all puckered up , declare confidentially , “ Business is business , but this man , captain , he make me very sick . Tfui ! ” ‘ I was looking at him from the shade . He was hurrying on a little in advance , and the sunlight beating on him brought out his bulk in a startling way . He made me think of a trained baby elephant walking on hind-legs . He was extravagantly gorgeous too -- got up in a soiled sleeping-suit , bright green and deep orange vertical stripes , with a pair of ragged straw slippers on his bare feet , and somebody ’ s cast-off pith hat , very dirty and two sizes too small for him , tied up with a manilla rope-yarn on the top of his big head . You understand a man like that hasn ’ t the ghost of a chance when it comes to borrowing clothes . Very well . On he came in hot haste , without a look right or left , passed within three feet of me , and in the innocence of his heart went on pelting upstairs into the harbour office to make his deposition , or report , or whatever you like to call it . ‘ It appears he addressed himself in the first instance to the principal shipping-master . Archie Ruthvel had just come in , and , as his story goes , was about to begin his arduous day by giving a dressing-down to his chief clerk . Some of you might have known him -- an obliging little Portuguese half-caste with a miserably skinny neck , and always on the hop to get something from the shipmasters in the way of eatables -- a piece of salt pork , a bag of biscuits , a few potatoes , or what not . One voyage , I recollect , I tipped him a live sheep out of the remnant of my sea-stock : not that I wanted him to do anything for me -- he couldn ’ t , you know -- but because his childlike belief in the sacred right to perquisites quite touched my heart . It was so strong as to be almost beautiful . The race -- the two races rather -- and the climate . . . However , never mind . I know where I have a friend for life . ‘ Well , Ruthvel says he was giving him a severe lecture -- on official morality , I suppose -- when he heard a kind of subdued commotion at his back , and turning his head he saw , in his own words , something round and enormous , resembling a sixteen-hundred-weight sugar-hogshead wrapped in striped flannelette , up-ended in the middle of the large floor space in the office . He declares he was so taken aback that for quite an appreciable time he did not realise the thing was alive , and sat still wondering for what purpose and by what means that object had been transported in front of his desk . The archway from the ante-room was crowded with punkah-pullers , sweepers , police peons , the coxswain and crew of the harbour steam-launch , all craning their necks and almost climbing on each other ’ s backs . Quite a riot . By that time the fellow had managed to tug and jerk his hat clear of his head , and advanced with slight bows at Ruthvel , who told me the sight was so discomposing that for some time he listened , quite unable to make out what that apparition wanted . It spoke in a voice harsh and lugubrious but intrepid , and little by little it dawned upon Archie that this was a development of the Patna case . He says that as soon as he understood who it was before him he felt quite unwell -- Archie is so sympathetic and easily upset -- but pulled himself together and shouted “ Stop ! I can ’ t listen to you . You must go to the Master Attendant . I can ’ t possibly listen to you . Captain Elliot is the man you want to see . This way , this way. ” He jumped up , ran round that long counter , pulled , shoved : the other let him , surprised but obedient at first , and only at the door of the private office some sort of animal instinct made him hang back and snort like a frightened bullock . “ Look here ! what ’ s up ? Let go ! Look here ! ” Archie flung open the door without knocking . “ The master of the Patna , sir , ” he shouts . “ Go in , captain. ” He saw the old man lift his head from some writing so sharp that his nose-nippers fell off , banged the door to , and fled to his desk , where he had some papers waiting for his signature : but he says the row that burst out in there was so awful that he couldn ’ t collect his senses sufficiently to remember the spelling of his own name . Archie ’ s the most sensitive shipping-master in the two hemispheres . He declares he felt as though he had thrown a man to a hungry lion . No doubt the noise was great . I heard it down below , and I have every reason to believe it was heard clear across the Esplanade as far as the band-stand . Old father Elliot had a great stock of words and could shout -- and didn ’ t mind who he shouted at either . He would have shouted at the Viceroy himself . As he used to tell me : “ I am as high as I can get ; my pension is safe . I ’ ve a few pounds laid by , and if they don ’ t like my notions of duty I would just as soon go home as not . I am an old man , and I have always spoken my mind . All I care for now is to see my girls married before I die. ” He was a little crazy on that point . His three daughters were awfully nice , though they resembled him amazingly , and on the mornings he woke up with a gloomy view of their matrimonial prospects the office would read it in his eye and tremble , because , they said , he was sure to have somebody for breakfast . However , that morning he did not eat the renegade , but , if I may be allowed to carry on the metaphor , chewed him up very small , so to speak , and -- ah ! ejected him again . ‘ Thus in a very few moments I saw his monstrous bulk descend in haste and stand still on the outer steps . He had stopped close to me for the purpose of profound meditation : his large purple cheeks quivered . He was biting his thumb , and after a while noticed me with a sidelong vexed look . The other three chaps that had landed with him made a little group waiting at some distance . There was a sallow-faced , mean little chap with his arm in a sling , and a long individual in a blue flannel coat , as dry as a chip and no stouter than a broomstick , with drooping grey moustaches , who looked about him with an air of jaunty imbecility . The third was an upstanding , broad-shouldered youth , with his hands in his pockets , turning his back on the other two who appeared to be talking together earnestly . He stared across the empty Esplanade . A ramshackle gharry , all dust and venetian blinds , pulled up short opposite the group , and the driver , throwing up his right foot over his knee , gave himself up to the critical examination of his toes . The young chap , making no movement , not even stirring his head , just stared into the sunshine . This was my first view of Jim . He looked as unconcerned and unapproachable as only the young can look . There he stood , clean-limbed , clean-faced , firm on his feet , as promising a boy as the sun ever shone on ; and , looking at him , knowing all he knew and a little more too , I was as angry as though I had detected him trying to get something out of me by false pretences . He had no business to look so sound . I thought to myself -- well , if this sort can go wrong like that . . . and I felt as though I could fling down my hat and dance on it from sheer mortification , as I once saw the skipper of an Italian barque do because his duffer of a mate got into a mess with his anchors when making a flying moor in a roadstead full of ships . I asked myself , seeing him there apparently so much at ease -- is he silly ? is he callous ? He seemed ready to start whistling a tune . And note , I did not care a rap about the behaviour of the other two . Their persons somehow fitted the tale that was public property , and was going to be the subject of an official inquiry . “ That old mad rogue upstairs called me a hound , ” said the captain of the Patna . I can ’ t tell whether he recognised me -- I rather think he did ; but at any rate our glances met . He glared -- I smiled ; hound was the very mildest epithet that had reached me through the open window . “ Did he ? ” I said from some strange inability to hold my tongue . He nodded , bit his thumb again , swore under his breath : then lifting his head and looking at me with sullen and passionate impudence -- “ Bah ! the Pacific is big , my friendt . You damned Englishmen can do your worst ; I know where there ’ s plenty room for a man like me : I am well aguaindt in Apia , in Honolulu , in . . . ” He paused reflectively , while without effort I could depict to myself the sort of people he was “ aguaindt ” with in those places . I won ’ t make a secret of it that I had been “ aguaindt ” with not a few of that sort myself . There are times when a man must act as though life were equally sweet in any company . I ’ ve known such a time , and , what ’ s more , I shan ’ t now pretend to pull a long face over my necessity , because a good many of that bad company from want of moral -- moral -- what shall I say ? -- posture , or from some other equally profound cause , were twice as instructive and twenty times more amusing than the usual respectable thief of commerce you fellows ask to sit at your table without any real necessity -- from habit , from cowardice , from good-nature , from a hundred sneaking and inadequate reasons . ‘ “ You Englishmen are all rogues , ” went on my patriotic Flensborg or Stettin Australian . I really don ’ t recollect now what decent little port on the shores of the Baltic was defiled by being the nest of that precious bird . “ What are you to shout ? Eh ? You tell me ? You no better than other people , and that old rogue he make Gottam fuss with me. ” His thick carcass trembled on its legs that were like a pair of pillars ; it trembled from head to foot . “ That ’ s what you English always make -- make a tam ’ fuss -- for any little thing , because I was not born in your tam ’ country . Take away my certificate . Take it . I don ’ t want the certificate . A man like me don ’ t want your verfluchte certificate . I shpit on it. ” He spat . “ I vill an Amerigan citizen begome , ” he cried , fretting and fuming and shuffling his feet as if to free his ankles from some invisible and mysterious grasp that would not let him get away from that spot . He made himself so warm that the top of his bullet head positively smoked . Nothing mysterious prevented me from going away : curiosity is the most obvious of sentiments , and it held me there to see the effect of a full information upon that young fellow who , hands in pockets , and turning his back upon the sidewalk , gazed across the grass-plots of the Esplanade at the yellow portico of the Malabar Hotel with the air of a man about to go for a walk as soon as his friend is ready . That ’ s how he looked , and it was odious . I waited to see him overwhelmed , confounded , pierced through and through , squirming like an impaled beetle -- and I was half afraid to see it too -- if you understand what I mean . Nothing more awful than to watch a man who has been found out , not in a crime but in a more than criminal weakness . The commonest sort of fortitude prevents us from becoming criminals in a legal sense ; it is from weakness unknown , but perhaps suspected , as in some parts of the world you suspect a deadly snake in every bush -- from weakness that may lie hidden , watched or unwatched , prayed against or manfully scorned , repressed or maybe ignored more than half a lifetime , not one of us is safe . We are snared into doing things for which we get called names , and things for which we get hanged , and yet the spirit may well survive -- survive the condemnation , survive the halter , by Jove ! And there are things -- they look small enough sometimes too -- by which some of us are totally and completely undone . I watched the youngster there . I liked his appearance ; I knew his appearance ; he came from the right place ; he was one of us . He stood there for all the parentage of his kind , for men and women by no means clever or amusing , but whose very existence is based upon honest faith , and upon the instinct of courage . I don ’ t mean military courage , or civil courage , or any special kind of courage . I mean just that inborn ability to look temptations straight in the face -- a readiness unintellectual enough , goodness knows , but without pose -- a power of resistance , don ’ t you see , ungracious if you like , but priceless -- an unthinking and blessed stiffness before the outward and inward terrors , before the might of nature and the seductive corruption of men -- backed by a faith invulnerable to the strength of facts , to the contagion of example , to the solicitation of ideas . Hang ideas ! They are tramps , vagabonds , knocking at the back-door of your mind , each taking a little of your substance , each carrying away some crumb of that belief in a few simple notions you must cling to if you want to live decently and would like to die easy ! ‘ This has nothing to do with Jim , directly ; only he was outwardly so typical of that good , stupid kind we like to feel marching right and left of us in life , of the kind that is not disturbed by the vagaries of intelligence and the perversions of -- of nerves , let us say . He was the kind of fellow you would , on the strength of his looks , leave in charge of the deck -- figuratively and professionally speaking . I say I would , and I ought to know . Haven ’ t I turned out youngsters enough in my time , for the service of the Red Rag , to the craft of the sea , to the craft whose whole secret could be expressed in one short sentence , and yet must be driven afresh every day into young heads till it becomes the component part of every waking thought -- till it is present in every dream of their young sleep ! The sea has been good to me , but when I remember all these boys that passed through my hands , some grown up now and some drowned by this time , but all good stuff for the sea , I don ’ t think I have done badly by it either . Were I to go home to-morrow , I bet that before two days passed over my head some sunburnt young chief mate would overtake me at some dock gateway or other , and a fresh deep voice speaking above my hat would ask : “ Don ’ t you remember me , sir ? Why ! little So-and-so . Such and such a ship . It was my first voyage. ” And I would remember a bewildered little shaver , no higher than the back of this chair , with a mother and perhaps a big sister on the quay , very quiet but too upset to wave their handkerchiefs at the ship that glides out gently between the pier-heads ; or perhaps some decent middle-aged father who had come early with his boy to see him off , and stays all the morning , because he is interested in the windlass apparently , and stays too long , and has got to scramble ashore at last with no time at all to say good-bye . The mud pilot on the poop sings out to me in a drawl , “ Hold her with the check line for a moment , Mister Mate . There ’ s a gentleman wants to get ashore . . . . Up with you , sir . Nearly got carried off to Talcahuano , didn ’ t you ? Now ’ s your time ; easy does it . . . . All right . Slack away again forward there. ” The tugs , smoking like the pit of perdition , get hold and churn the old river into fury ; the gentleman ashore is dusting his knees -- the benevolent steward has shied his umbrella after him . All very proper . He has offered his bit of sacrifice to the sea , and now he may go home pretending he thinks nothing of it ; and the little willing victim shall be very sea-sick before next morning . By-and-by , when he has learned all the little mysteries and the one great secret of the craft , he shall be fit to live or die as the sea may decree ; and the man who had taken a hand in this fool game , in which the sea wins every toss , will be pleased to have his back slapped by a heavy young hand , and to hear a cheery sea-puppy voice : “ Do you remember me , sir ? The little So-and-so. ” ‘ I tell you this is good ; it tells you that once in your life at least you had gone the right way to work . I have been thus slapped , and I have winced , for the slap was heavy , and I have glowed all day long and gone to bed feeling less lonely in the world by virtue of that hearty thump . Don ’ t I remember the little So-and-so ’ s ! I tell you I ought to know the right kind of looks . I would have trusted the deck to that youngster on the strength of a single glance , and gone to sleep with both eyes -- and , by Jove ! it wouldn ’ t have been safe . There are depths of horror in that thought . He looked as genuine as a new sovereign , but there was some infernal alloy in his metal . How much ? The least thing -- the least drop of something rare and accursed ; the least drop ! -- but he made you -- standing there with his don ’ t-care-hang air -- he made you wonder whether perchance he were nothing more rare than brass . ‘ I couldn ’ t believe it . I tell you I wanted to see him squirm for the honour of the craft . The other two no-account chaps spotted their captain , and began to move slowly towards us . They chatted together as they strolled , and I did not care any more than if they had not been visible to the naked eye . They grinned at each other -- might have been exchanging jokes , for all I know . I saw that with one of them it was a case of a broken arm ; and as to the long individual with grey moustaches he was the chief engineer , and in various ways a pretty notorious personality . They were nobodies . They approached . The skipper gazed in an inanimate way between his feet : he seemed to be swollen to an unnatural size by some awful disease , by the mysterious action of an unknown poison . He lifted his head , saw the two before him waiting , opened his mouth with an extraordinary , sneering contortion of his puffed face -- to speak to them , I suppose -- and then a thought seemed to strike him . His thick , purplish lips came together without a sound , he went off in a resolute waddle to the gharry and began to jerk at the door-handle with such a blind brutality of impatience that I expected to see the whole concern overturned on its side , pony and all . The driver , shaken out of his meditation over the sole of his foot , displayed at once all the signs of intense terror , and held with both hands , looking round from his box at this vast carcass forcing its way into his conveyance . The little machine shook and rocked tumultuously , and the crimson nape of that lowered neck , the size of those straining thighs , the immense heaving of that dingy , striped green-and-orange back , the whole burrowing effort of that gaudy and sordid mass , troubled one ’ s sense of probability with a droll and fearsome effect , like one of those grotesque and distinct visions that scare and fascinate one in a fever . He disappeared . I half expected the roof to split in two , the little box on wheels to burst open in the manner of a ripe cotton-pod -- but it only sank with a click of flattened springs , and suddenly one venetian blind rattled down . His shoulders reappeared , jammed in the small opening ; his head hung out , distended and tossing like a captive balloon , perspiring , furious , spluttering . He reached for the gharry-wallah with vicious flourishes of a fist as dumpy and red as a lump of raw meat . He roared at him to be off , to go on . Where ? Into the Pacific , perhaps . The driver lashed ; the pony snorted , reared once , and darted off at a gallop . Where ? To Apia ? To Honolulu ? He had 6000 miles of tropical belt to disport himself in , and I did not hear the precise address . A snorting pony snatched him into “ Ewigkeit ” in the twinkling of an eye , and I never saw him again ; and , what ’ s more , I don ’ t know of anybody that ever had a glimpse of him after he departed from my knowledge sitting inside a ramshackle little gharry that fled round the corner in a white smother of dust . He departed , disappeared , vanished , absconded ; and absurdly enough it looked as though he had taken that gharry with him , for never again did I come across a sorrel pony with a slit ear and a lackadaisical Tamil driver afflicted by a sore foot . The Pacific is indeed big ; but whether he found a place for a display of his talents in it or not , the fact remains he had flown into space like a witch on a broomstick . The little chap with his arm in a sling started to run after the carriage , bleating , “ Captain ! I say , Captain ! I sa-a-ay ! ” -- but after a few steps stopped short , hung his head , and walked back slowly . At the sharp rattle of the wheels the young fellow spun round where he stood . He made no other movement , no gesture , no sign , and remained facing in the new direction after the gharry had swung out of sight . ‘ All this happened in much less time than it takes to tell , since I am trying to interpret for you into slow speech the instantaneous effect of visual impressions . Next moment the half-caste clerk , sent by Archie to look a little after the poor castaways of the Patna , came upon the scene . He ran out eager and bareheaded , looking right and left , and very full of his mission . It was doomed to be a failure as far as the principal person was concerned , but he approached the others with fussy importance , and , almost immediately , found himself involved in a violent altercation with the chap that carried his arm in a sling , and who turned out to be extremely anxious for a row . He wasn ’ t going to be ordered about -- “ not he , b ’ gosh. ” He wouldn ’ t be terrified with a pack of lies by a cocky half-bred little quill-driver . He was not going to be bullied by “ no object of that sort , ” if the story were true “ ever so ” ! He bawled his wish , his desire , his determination to go to bed . “ If you weren ’ t a God-forsaken Portuguee , ” I heard him yell , “ you would know that the hospital is the right place for me. ” He pushed the fist of his sound arm under the other ’ s nose ; a crowd began to collect ; the half-caste , flustered , but doing his best to appear dignified , tried to explain his intentions . I went away without waiting to see the end . ‘ But it so happened that I had a man in the hospital at the time , and going there to see about him the day before the opening of the Inquiry , I saw in the white men ’ s ward that little chap tossing on his back , with his arm in splints , and quite light-headed . To my great surprise the other one , the long individual with drooping white moustache , had also found his way there . I remembered I had seen him slinking away during the quarrel , in a half prance , half shuffle , and trying very hard not to look scared . He was no stranger to the port , it seems , and in his distress was able to make tracks straight for Mariani ’ s billiard-room and grog-shop near the bazaar . That unspeakable vagabond , Mariani , who had known the man and had ministered to his vices in one or two other places , kissed the ground , in a manner of speaking , before him , and shut him up with a supply of bottles in an upstairs room of his infamous hovel . It appears he was under some hazy apprehension as to his personal safety , and wished to be concealed . However , Mariani told me a long time after ( when he came on board one day to dun my steward for the price of some cigars ) that he would have done more for him without asking any questions , from gratitude for some unholy favour received very many years ago -- as far as I could make out . He thumped twice his brawny chest , rolled enormous black-and-white eyes glistening with tears : “ Antonio never forget -- Antonio never forget ! ” What was the precise nature of the immoral obligation I never learned , but be it what it may , he had every facility given him to remain under lock and key , with a chair , a table , a mattress in a corner , and a litter of fallen plaster on the floor , in an irrational state of funk , and keeping up his pecker with such tonics as Mariani dispensed . This lasted till the evening of the third day , when , after letting out a few horrible screams , he found himself compelled to seek safety in flight from a legion of centipedes . He burst the door open , made one leap for dear life down the crazy little stairway , landed bodily on Mariani ’ s stomach , picked himself up , and bolted like a rabbit into the streets . The police plucked him off a garbage-heap in the early morning . At first he had a notion they were carrying him off to be hanged , and fought for liberty like a hero , but when I sat down by his bed he had been very quiet for two days . His lean bronzed head , with white moustaches , looked fine and calm on the pillow , like the head of a war-worn soldier with a child-like soul , had it not been for a hint of spectral alarm that lurked in the blank glitter of his glance , resembling a nondescript form of a terror crouching silently behind a pane of glass . He was so extremely calm , that I began to indulge in the eccentric hope of hearing something explanatory of the famous affair from his point of view . Why I longed to go grubbing into the deplorable details of an occurrence which , after all , concerned me no more than as a member of an obscure body of men held together by a community of inglorious toil and by fidelity to a certain standard of conduct , I can ’ t explain . You may call it an unhealthy curiosity if you like ; but I have a distinct notion I wished to find something . Perhaps , unconsciously , I hoped I would find that something , some profound and redeeming cause , some merciful explanation , some convincing shadow of an excuse . I see well enough now that I hoped for the impossible -- for the laying of what is the most obstinate ghost of man ’ s creation , of the uneasy doubt uprising like a mist , secret and gnawing like a worm , and more chilling than the certitude of death -- the doubt of the sovereign power enthroned in a fixed standard of conduct . It is the hardest thing to stumble against ; it is the thing that breeds yelling panics and good little quiet villainies ; it ’ s the true shadow of calamity . Did I believe in a miracle ? and why did I desire it so ardently ? Was it for my own sake that I wished to find some shadow of an excuse for that young fellow whom I had never seen before , but whose appearance alone added a touch of personal concern to the thoughts suggested by the knowledge of his weakness -- made it a thing of mystery and terror -- like a hint of a destructive fate ready for us all whose youth -- in its day -- had resembled his youth ? I fear that such was the secret motive of my prying . I was , and no mistake , looking for a miracle . The only thing that at this distance of time strikes me as miraculous is the extent of my imbecility . I positively hoped to obtain from that battered and shady invalid some exorcism against the ghost of doubt . I must have been pretty desperate too , for , without loss of time , after a few indifferent and friendly sentences which he answered with languid readiness , just as any decent sick man would do , I produced the word Patna wrapped up in a delicate question as in a wisp of floss silk . I was delicate selfishly ; I did not want to startle him ; I had no solicitude for him ; I was not furious with him and sorry for him : his experience was of no importance , his redemption would have had no point for me . He had grown old in minor iniquities , and could no longer inspire aversion or pity . He repeated Patna ? interrogatively , seemed to make a short effort of memory , and said : “ Quite right . I am an old stager out here . I saw her go down. ” I made ready to vent my indignation at such a stupid lie , when he added smoothly , “ She was full of reptiles. ” ‘ This made me pause . What did he mean ? The unsteady phantom of terror behind his glassy eyes seemed to stand still and look into mine wistfully . “ They turned me out of my bunk in the middle watch to look at her sinking , ” he pursued in a reflective tone . His voice sounded alarmingly strong all at once . I was sorry for my folly . There was no snowy-winged coif of a nursing sister to be seen flitting in the perspective of the ward ; but away in the middle of a long row of empty iron bedsteads an accident case from some ship in the Roads sat up brown and gaunt with a white bandage set rakishly on the forehead . Suddenly my interesting invalid shot out an arm thin like a tentacle and clawed my shoulder . “ Only my eyes were good enough to see . I am famous for my eyesight . That ’ s why they called me , I expect . None of them was quick enough to see her go , but they saw that she was gone right enough , and sang out together -- like this. ” . . . A wolfish howl searched the very recesses of my soul . “ Oh ! make ‘ im dry up , ” whined the accident case irritably . “ You don ’ t believe me , I suppose , ” went on the other , with an air of ineffable conceit . “ I tell you there are no such eyes as mine this side of the Persian Gulf . Look under the bed. ” ‘ Of course I stooped instantly . I defy anybody not to have done so . “ What can you see ? ” he asked . “ Nothing , ” I said , feeling awfully ashamed of myself . He scrutinised my face with wild and withering contempt . “ Just so , ” he said , “ but if I were to look I could see -- there ’ s no eyes like mine , I tell you. ” Again he clawed , pulling at me downwards in his eagerness to relieve himself by a confidential communication . “ Millions of pink toads . There ’ s no eyes like mine . Millions of pink toads . It ’ s worse than seeing a ship sink . I could look at sinking ships and smoke my pipe all day long . Why don ’ t they give me back my pipe ? I would get a smoke while I watched these toads . The ship was full of them . They ’ ve got to be watched , you know. ” He winked facetiously . The perspiration dripped on him off my head , my drill coat clung to my wet back : the afternoon breeze swept impetuously over the row of bedsteads , the stiff folds of curtains stirred perpendicularly , rattling on brass rods , the covers of empty beds blew about noiselessly near the bare floor all along the line , and I shivered to the very marrow . The soft wind of the tropics played in that naked ward as bleak as a winter ’ s gale in an old barn at home . “ Don ’ t you let him start his hollering , mister , ” hailed from afar the accident case in a distressed angry shout that came ringing between the walls like a quavering call down a tunnel . The clawing hand hauled at my shoulder ; he leered at me knowingly . “ The ship was full of them , you know , and we had to clear out on the strict Q.T. , ” he whispered with extreme rapidity . “ All pink . All pink -- as big as mastiffs , with an eye on the top of the head and claws all round their ugly mouths . Ough ! Ough ! ” Quick jerks as of galvanic shocks disclosed under the flat coverlet the outlines of meagre and agitated legs ; he let go my shoulder and reached after something in the air ; his body trembled tensely like a released harp-string ; and while I looked down , the spectral horror in him broke through his glassy gaze . Instantly his face of an old soldier , with its noble and calm outlines , became decomposed before my eyes by the corruption of stealthy cunning , of an abominable caution and of desperate fear . He restrained a cry -- “ Ssh ! what are they doing now down there ? ” he asked , pointing to the floor with fantastic precautions of voice and gesture , whose meaning , borne upon my mind in a lurid flash , made me very sick of my cleverness . “ They are all asleep , ” I answered , watching him narrowly . That was it . That ’ s what he wanted to hear ; these were the exact words that could calm him . He drew a long breath . “ Ssh ! Quiet , steady . I am an old stager out here . I know them brutes . Bash in the head of the first that stirs . There ’ s too many of them , and she won ’ t swim more than ten minutes. ” He panted again . “ Hurry up , ” he yelled suddenly , and went on in a steady scream : “ They are all awake -- millions of them . They are trampling on me ! Wait ! Oh , wait ! I ’ ll smash them in heaps like flies . Wait for me ! Help ! H-e-elp ! ” An interminable and sustained howl completed my discomfiture . I saw in the distance the accident case raise deplorably both his hands to his bandaged head ; a dresser , aproned to the chin showed himself in the vista of the ward , as if seen in the small end of a telescope . I confessed myself fairly routed , and without more ado , stepping out through one of the long windows , escaped into the outside gallery . The howl pursued me like a vengeance . I turned into a deserted landing , and suddenly all became very still and quiet around me , and I descended the bare and shiny staircase in a silence that enabled me to compose my distracted thoughts . Down below I met one of the resident surgeons who was crossing the courtyard and stopped me . “ Been to see your man , Captain ? I think we may let him go to-morrow . These fools have no notion of taking care of themselves , though . I say , we ’ ve got the chief engineer of that pilgrim ship here . A curious case . D.T. ’ s of the worst kind . He has been drinking hard in that Greek ’ s or Italian ’ s grog-shop for three days . What can you expect ? Four bottles of that kind of brandy a day , I am told . Wonderful , if true . Sheeted with boiler-iron inside I should think . The head , ah ! the head , of course , gone , but the curious part is there ’ s some sort of method in his raving . I am trying to find out . Most unusual -- that thread of logic in such a delirium . Traditionally he ought to see snakes , but he doesn ’ t . Good old tradition ’ s at a discount nowadays . Eh ! His -- er -- visions are batrachian . Ha ! ha ! No , seriously , I never remember being so interested in a case of jim-jams before . He ought to be dead , don ’ t you know , after such a festive experiment . Oh ! he is a tough object . Four-and-twenty years of the tropics too . You ought really to take a peep at him . Noble-looking old boozer . Most extraordinary man I ever met -- medically , of course . Won ’ t you ? ” ‘ I have been all along exhibiting the usual polite signs of interest , but now assuming an air of regret I murmured of want of time , and shook hands in a hurry . “ I say , ” he cried after me ; “ he can ’ t attend that inquiry . Is his evidence material , you think ? ” ‘ “ Not in the least , ” I called back from the gateway. ’ CHAPTER 6 ‘ The authorities were evidently of the same opinion . The inquiry was not adjourned . It was held on the appointed day to satisfy the law , and it was well attended because of its human interest , no doubt . There was no incertitude as to facts -- as to the one material fact , I mean . How the Patna came by her hurt it was impossible to find out ; the court did not expect to find out ; and in the whole audience there was not a man who cared . Yet , as I ’ ve told you , all the sailors in the port attended , and the waterside business was fully represented . Whether they knew it or not , the interest that drew them here was purely psychological -- the expectation of some essential disclosure as to the strength , the power , the horror , of human emotions . Naturally nothing of the kind could be disclosed . The examination of the only man able and willing to face it was beating futilely round the well-known fact , and the play of questions upon it was as instructive as the tapping with a hammer on an iron box , were the object to find out what ’ s inside . However , an official inquiry could not be any other thing . Its object was not the fundamental why , but the superficial how , of this affair . ‘ The young chap could have told them , and , though that very thing was the thing that interested the audience , the questions put to him necessarily led him away from what to me , for instance , would have been the only truth worth knowing . You can ’ t expect the constituted authorities to inquire into the state of a man ’ s soul -- or is it only of his liver ? Their business was to come down upon the consequences , and frankly , a casual police magistrate and two nautical assessors are not much good for anything else . I don ’ t mean to imply these fellows were stupid . The magistrate was very patient . One of the assessors was a sailing-ship skipper with a reddish beard , and of a pious disposition . Brierly was the other . Big Brierly . Some of you must have heard of Big Brierly -- the captain of the crack ship of the Blue Star line . That ’ s the man . ‘ He seemed consumedly bored by the honour thrust upon him . He had never in his life made a mistake , never had an accident , never a mishap , never a check in his steady rise , and he seemed to be one of those lucky fellows who know nothing of indecision , much less of self-mistrust . At thirty-two he had one of the best commands going in the Eastern trade -- and , what ’ s more , he thought a lot of what he had . There was nothing like it in the world , and I suppose if you had asked him point-blank he would have confessed that in his opinion there was not such another commander . The choice had fallen upon the right man . The rest of mankind that did not command the sixteen-knot steel steamer Ossa were rather poor creatures . He had saved lives at sea , had rescued ships in distress , had a gold chronometer presented to him by the underwriters , and a pair of binoculars with a suitable inscription from some foreign Government , in commemoration of these services . He was acutely aware of his merits and of his rewards . I liked him well enough , though some I know -- meek , friendly men at that -- couldn ’ t stand him at any price . I haven ’ t the slightest doubt he considered himself vastly my superior -- indeed , had you been Emperor of East and West , you could not have ignored your inferiority in his presence -- but I couldn ’ t get up any real sentiment of offence . He did not despise me for anything I could help , for anything I was -- don ’ t you know ? I was a negligible quantity simply because I was not _the_ fortunate man of the earth , not Montague Brierly in command of the Ossa , not the owner of an inscribed gold chronometer and of silver-mounted binoculars testifying to the excellence of my seamanship and to my indomitable pluck ; not possessed of an acute sense of my merits and of my rewards , besides the love and worship of a black retriever , the most wonderful of its kind -- for never was such a man loved thus by such a dog . No doubt , to have all this forced upon you was exasperating enough ; but when I reflected that I was associated in these fatal disadvantages with twelve hundred millions of other more or less human beings , I found I could bear my share of his good-natured and contemptuous pity for the sake of something indefinite and attractive in the man . I have never defined to myself this attraction , but there were moments when I envied him . The sting of life could do no more to his complacent soul than the scratch of a pin to the smooth face of a rock . This was enviable . As I looked at him , flanking on one side the unassuming pale-faced magistrate who presided at the inquiry , his self-satisfaction presented to me and to the world a surface as hard as granite . He committed suicide very soon after . ‘ No wonder Jim ’ s case bored him , and while I thought with something akin to fear of the immensity of his contempt for the young man under examination , he was probably holding silent inquiry into his own case . The verdict must have been of unmitigated guilt , and he took the secret of the evidence with him in that leap into the sea . If I understand anything of men , the matter was no doubt of the gravest import , one of those trifles that awaken ideas -- start into life some thought with which a man unused to such a companionship finds it impossible to live . I am in a position to know that it wasn ’ t money , and it wasn ’ t drink , and it wasn ’ t woman . He jumped overboard at sea barely a week after the end of the inquiry , and less than three days after leaving port on his outward passage ; as though on that exact spot in the midst of waters he had suddenly perceived the gates of the other world flung open wide for his reception . ‘ Yet it was not a sudden impulse . His grey-headed mate , a first-rate sailor and a nice old chap with strangers , but in his relations with his commander the surliest chief officer I ’ ve ever seen , would tell the story with tears in his eyes . It appears that when he came on deck in the morning Brierly had been writing in the chart-room . “ It was ten minutes to four , ” he said , “ and the middle watch was not relieved yet of course . He heard my voice on the bridge speaking to the second mate , and called me in . I was loth to go , and that ’ s the truth , Captain Marlow -- I couldn ’ t stand poor Captain Brierly , I tell you with shame ; we never know what a man is made of . He had been promoted over too many heads , not counting my own , and he had a damnable trick of making you feel small , nothing but by the way he said ‘ Good morning. ’ I never addressed him , sir , but on matters of duty , and then it was as much as I could do to keep a civil tongue in my head. ” ( He flattered himself there . I often wondered how Brierly could put up with his manners for more than half a voyage . ) “ I ’ ve a wife and children , ” he went on , “ and I had been ten years in the Company , always expecting the next command -- more fool I . Says he , just like this : ‘ Come in here , Mr. Jones , ’ in that swagger voice of his -- ‘ Come in here , Mr. Jones. ’ In I went . ‘ We ’ ll lay down her position , ’ says he , stooping over the chart , a pair of dividers in hand . By the standing orders , the officer going off duty would have done that at the end of his watch . However , I said nothing , and looked on while he marked off the ship ’ s position with a tiny cross and wrote the date and the time . I can see him this moment writing his neat figures : seventeen , eight , four A.M . The year would be written in red ink at the top of the chart . He never used his charts more than a year , Captain Brierly didn ’ t . I ’ ve the chart now . When he had done he stands looking down at the mark he had made and smiling to himself , then looks up at me . ‘ Thirty-two miles more as she goes , ’ says he , ‘ and then we shall be clear , and you may alter the course twenty degrees to the southward. ’ ‘ “ We were passing to the north of the Hector Bank that voyage . I said , ‘ All right , sir , ’ wondering what he was fussing about , since I had to call him before altering the course anyhow . Just then eight bells were struck : we came out on the bridge , and the second mate before going off mentions in the usual way -- ‘ Seventy-one on the log. ’ Captain Brierly looks at the compass and then all round . It was dark and clear , and all the stars were out as plain as on a frosty night in high latitudes . Suddenly he says with a sort of a little sigh : ‘ I am going aft , and shall set the log at zero for you myself , so that there can be no mistake . Thirty-two miles more on this course and then you are safe . Let ’ s see -- the correction on the log is six per cent . additive ; say , then , thirty by the dial to run , and you may come twenty degrees to starboard at once . No use losing any distance -- is there ? ’ I had never heard him talk so much at a stretch , and to no purpose as it seemed to me . I said nothing . He went down the ladder , and the dog , that was always at his heels whenever he moved , night or day , followed , sliding nose first , after him . I heard his boot-heels tap , tap on the after-deck , then he stopped and spoke to the dog -- ‘ Go back , Rover . On the bridge , boy ! Go on -- get. ’ Then he calls out to me from the dark , ‘ Shut that dog up in the chart-room , Mr. Jones -- will you ? ’ ‘ “ This was the last time I heard his voice , Captain Marlow . These are the last words he spoke in the hearing of any living human being , sir. ” At this point the old chap ’ s voice got quite unsteady . “ He was afraid the poor brute would jump after him , don ’ t you see ? ” he pursued with a quaver . “ Yes , Captain Marlow . He set the log for me ; he -- would you believe it ? -- he put a drop of oil in it too . There was the oil-feeder where he left it near by . The boat-swain ’ s mate got the hose along aft to wash down at half-past five ; by-and-by he knocks off and runs up on the bridge -- ‘ Will you please come aft , Mr. Jones , ’ he says . ‘ There ’ s a funny thing . I don ’ t like to touch it. ’ It was Captain Brierly ’ s gold chronometer watch carefully hung under the rail by its chain . ‘ “ As soon as my eyes fell on it something struck me , and I knew , sir . My legs got soft under me . It was as if I had seen him go over ; and I could tell how far behind he was left too . The taffrail-log marked eighteen miles and three-quarters , and four iron belaying-pins were missing round the mainmast . Put them in his pockets to help him down , I suppose ; but , Lord ! what ’ s four iron pins to a powerful man like Captain Brierly . Maybe his confidence in himself was just shook a bit at the last . That ’ s the only sign of fluster he gave in his whole life , I should think ; but I am ready to answer for him , that once over he did not try to swim a stroke , the same as he would have had pluck enough to keep up all day long on the bare chance had he fallen overboard accidentally . Yes , sir . He was second to none -- if he said so himself , as I heard him once . He had written two letters in the middle watch , one to the Company and the other to me . He gave me a lot of instructions as to the passage -- I had been in the trade before he was out of his time -- and no end of hints as to my conduct with our people in Shanghai , so that I should keep the command of the Ossa . He wrote like a father would to a favourite son , Captain Marlow , and I was five-and-twenty years his senior and had tasted salt water before he was fairly breeched . In his letter to the owners -- it was left open for me to see -- he said that he had always done his duty by them -- up to that moment -- and even now he was not betraying their confidence , since he was leaving the ship to as competent a seaman as could be found -- meaning me , sir , meaning me ! He told them that if the last act of his life didn ’ t take away all his credit with them , they would give weight to my faithful service and to his warm recommendation , when about to fill the vacancy made by his death . And much more like this , sir . I couldn ’ t believe my eyes . It made me feel queer all over , ” went on the old chap , in great perturbation , and squashing something in the corner of his eye with the end of a thumb as broad as a spatula . “ You would think , sir , he had jumped overboard only to give an unlucky man a last show to get on . What with the shock of him going in this awful rash way , and thinking myself a made man by that chance , I was nearly off my chump for a week . But no fear . The captain of the Pelion was shifted into the Ossa -- came aboard in Shanghai -- a little popinjay , sir , in a grey check suit , with his hair parted in the middle . ‘ Aw -- I am -- aw -- your new captain , Mister -- Mister -- aw -- Jones. ’ He was drowned in scent -- fairly stunk with it , Captain Marlow . I dare say it was the look I gave him that made him stammer . He mumbled something about my natural disappointment -- I had better know at once that his chief officer got the promotion to the Pelion -- he had nothing to do with it , of course -- supposed the office knew best -- sorry . . . . Says I , ‘ Don ’ t you mind old Jones , sir ; dam ’ his soul , he ’ s used to it. ’ I could see directly I had shocked his delicate ear , and while we sat at our first tiffin together he began to find fault in a nasty manner with this and that in the ship . I never heard such a voice out of a Punch and Judy show . I set my teeth hard , and glued my eyes to my plate , and held my peace as long as I could ; but at last I had to say something . Up he jumps tiptoeing , ruffling all his pretty plumes , like a little fighting-cock . ‘ You ’ ll find you have a different person to deal with than the late Captain Brierly. ’ ‘ I ’ ve found it , ’ says I , very glum , but pretending to be mighty busy with my steak . ‘ You are an old ruffian , Mister -- aw -- Jones ; and what ’ s more , you are known for an old ruffian in the employ , ’ he squeaks at me . The damned bottle-washers stood about listening with their mouths stretched from ear to ear . ‘ I may be a hard case , ’ answers I , ‘ but I ain ’ t so far gone as to put up with the sight of you sitting in Captain Brierly ’ s chair. ’ With that I lay down my knife and fork . ‘ You would like to sit in it yourself -- that ’ s where the shoe pinches , ’ he sneers . I left the saloon , got my rags together , and was on the quay with all my dunnage about my feet before the stevedores had turned to again . Yes . Adrift -- on shore -- after ten years ’ service -- and with a poor woman and four children six thousand miles off depending on my half-pay for every mouthful they ate . Yes , sir ! I chucked it rather than hear Captain Brierly abused . He left me his night-glasses -- here they are ; and he wished me to take care of the dog -- here he is . Hallo , Rover , poor boy . Where ’ s the captain , Rover ? ” The dog looked up at us with mournful yellow eyes , gave one desolate bark , and crept under the table . ‘ All this was taking place , more than two years afterwards , on board that nautical ruin the Fire-Queen this Jones had got charge of -- quite by a funny accident , too -- from Matherson -- mad Matherson they generally called him -- the same who used to hang out in Hai-phong , you know , before the occupation days . The old chap snuffled on -- ‘ “ Ay , sir , Captain Brierly will be remembered here , if there ’ s no other place on earth . I wrote fully to his father and did not get a word in reply -- neither Thank you , nor Go to the devil ! -- nothing ! Perhaps they did not want to know. ” ‘ The sight of that watery-eyed old Jones mopping his bald head with a red cotton handkerchief , the sorrowing yelp of the dog , the squalor of that fly-blown cuddy which was the only shrine of his memory , threw a veil of inexpressibly mean pathos over Brierly ’ s remembered figure , the posthumous revenge of fate for that belief in his own splendour which had almost cheated his life of its legitimate terrors . Almost ! Perhaps wholly . Who can tell what flattering view he had induced himself to take of his own suicide ? ‘ “ Why did he commit the rash act , Captain Marlow -- can you think ? ” asked Jones , pressing his palms together . “ Why ? It beats me ! Why ? ” He slapped his low and wrinkled forehead . “ If he had been poor and old and in debt -- and never a show -- or else mad . But he wasn ’ t of the kind that goes mad , not he . You trust me . What a mate don ’ t know about his skipper isn ’ t worth knowing . Young , healthy , well off , no cares . . . . I sit here sometimes thinking , thinking , till my head fairly begins to buzz . There was some reason. ” ‘ “ You may depend on it , Captain Jones , ” said I , “ it wasn ’ t anything that would have disturbed much either of us two , ” I said ; and then , as if a light had been flashed into the muddle of his brain , poor old Jones found a last word of amazing profundity . He blew his nose , nodding at me dolefully : “ Ay , ay ! neither you nor I , sir , had ever thought so much of ourselves. ” ‘ Of course the recollection of my last conversation with Brierly is tinged with the knowledge of his end that followed so close upon it . I spoke with him for the last time during the progress of the inquiry . It was after the first adjournment , and he came up with me in the street . He was in a state of irritation , which I noticed with surprise , his usual behaviour when he condescended to converse being perfectly cool , with a trace of amused tolerance , as if the existence of his interlocutor had been a rather good joke . “ They caught me for that inquiry , you see , ” he began , and for a while enlarged complainingly upon the inconveniences of daily attendance in court . “ And goodness knows how long it will last . Three days , I suppose. ” I heard him out in silence ; in my then opinion it was a way as good as another of putting on side . “ What ’ s the use of it ? It is the stupidest set-out you can imagine , ” he pursued hotly . I remarked that there was no option . He interrupted me with a sort of pent-up violence . “ I feel like a fool all the time. ” I looked up at him . This was going very far -- for Brierly -- when talking of Brierly . He stopped short , and seizing the lapel of my coat , gave it a slight tug . “ Why are we tormenting that young chap ? ” he asked . This question chimed in so well to the tolling of a certain thought of mine that , with the image of the absconding renegade in my eye , I answered at once , “ Hanged if I know , unless it be that he lets you. ” I was astonished to see him fall into line , so to speak , with that utterance , which ought to have been tolerably cryptic . He said angrily , “ Why , yes . Can ’ t he see that wretched skipper of his has cleared out ? What does he expect to happen ? Nothing can save him . He ’ s done for. ” We walked on in silence a few steps . “ Why eat all that dirt ? ” he exclaimed , with an oriental energy of expression -- about the only sort of energy you can find a trace of east of the fiftieth meridian . I wondered greatly at the direction of his thoughts , but now I strongly suspect it was strictly in character : at bottom poor Brierly must have been thinking of himself . I pointed out to him that the skipper of the Patna was known to have feathered his nest pretty well , and could procure almost anywhere the means of getting away . With Jim it was otherwise : the Government was keeping him in the Sailors ’ Home for the time being , and probably he hadn ’ t a penny in his pocket to bless himself with . It costs some money to run away . “ Does it ? Not always , ” he said , with a bitter laugh , and to some further remark of mine -- “ Well , then , let him creep twenty feet underground and stay there ! By heavens ! _I_ would. ” I don ’ t know why his tone provoked me , and I said , “ There is a kind of courage in facing it out as he does , knowing very well that if he went away nobody would trouble to run after him. ” “ Courage be hanged ! ” growled Brierly . “ That sort of courage is of no use to keep a man straight , and I don ’ t care a snap for such courage . If you were to say it was a kind of cowardice now -- of softness . I tell you what , I will put up two hundred rupees if you put up another hundred and undertake to make the beggar clear out early to-morrow morning . The fellow ’ s a gentleman if he ain ’ t fit to be touched -- he will understand . He must ! This infernal publicity is too shocking : there he sits while all these confounded natives , serangs , lascars , quartermasters , are giving evidence that ’ s enough to burn a man to ashes with shame . This is abominable . Why , Marlow , don ’ t you think , don ’ t you feel , that this is abominable ; don ’ t you now -- come -- as a seaman ? If he went away all this would stop at once. ” Brierly said these words with a most unusual animation , and made as if to reach after his pocket-book . I restrained him , and declared coldly that the cowardice of these four men did not seem to me a matter of such great importance . “ And you call yourself a seaman , I suppose , ” he pronounced angrily . I said that ’ s what I called myself , and I hoped I was too . He heard me out , and made a gesture with his big arm that seemed to deprive me of my individuality , to push me away into the crowd . “ The worst of it , ” he said , “ is that all you fellows have no sense of dignity ; you don ’ t think enough of what you are supposed to be. ” ‘ We had been walking slowly meantime , and now stopped opposite the harbour office , in sight of the very spot from which the immense captain of the Patna had vanished as utterly as a tiny feather blown away in a hurricane . I smiled . Brierly went on : “ This is a disgrace . We ’ ve got all kinds amongst us -- some anointed scoundrels in the lot ; but , hang it , we must preserve professional decency or we become no better than so many tinkers going about loose . We are trusted . Do you understand ? -- trusted ! Frankly , I don ’ t care a snap for all the pilgrims that ever came out of Asia , but a decent man would not have behaved like this to a full cargo of old rags in bales . We aren ’ t an organised body of men , and the only thing that holds us together is just the name for that kind of decency . Such an affair destroys one ’ s confidence . A man may go pretty near through his whole sea-life without any call to show a stiff upper lip . But when the call comes . . . Aha ! . . . If I . . . ” ‘ He broke off , and in a changed tone , “ I ’ ll give you two hundred rupees now , Marlow , and you just talk to that chap . Confound him ! I wish he had never come out here . Fact is , I rather think some of my people know his . The old man ’ s a parson , and I remember now I met him once when staying with my cousin in Essex last year . If I am not mistaken , the old chap seemed rather to fancy his sailor son . Horrible . I can ’ t do it myself -- but you . . . ” ‘ Thus , apropos of Jim , I had a glimpse of the real Brierly a few days before he committed his reality and his sham together to the keeping of the sea . Of course I declined to meddle . The tone of this last “ but you ” ( poor Brierly couldn ’ t help it ) , that seemed to imply I was no more noticeable than an insect , caused me to look at the proposal with indignation , and on account of that provocation , or for some other reason , I became positive in my mind that the inquiry was a severe punishment to that Jim , and that his facing it -- practically of his own free will -- was a redeeming feature in his abominable case . I hadn ’ t been so sure of it before . Brierly went off in a huff . At the time his state of mind was more of a mystery to me than it is now . ‘ Next day , coming into court late , I sat by myself . Of course I could not forget the conversation I had with Brierly , and now I had them both under my eyes . The demeanour of one suggested gloomy impudence and of the other a contemptuous boredom ; yet one attitude might not have been truer than the other , and I was aware that one was not true . Brierly was not bored -- he was exasperated ; and if so , then Jim might not have been impudent . According to my theory he was not . I imagined he was hopeless . Then it was that our glances met . They met , and the look he gave me was discouraging of any intention I might have had to speak to him . Upon either hypothesis -- insolence or despair -- I felt I could be of no use to him . This was the second day of the proceedings . Very soon after that exchange of glances the inquiry was adjourned again to the next day . The white men began to troop out at once . Jim had been told to stand down some time before , and was able to leave amongst the first . I saw his broad shoulders and his head outlined in the light of the door , and while I made my way slowly out talking with some one -- some stranger who had addressed me casually -- I could see him from within the court-room resting both elbows on the balustrade of the verandah and turning his back on the small stream of people trickling down the few steps . There was a murmur of voices and a shuffle of boots . ‘ The next case was that of assault and battery committed upon a money-lender , I believe ; and the defendant -- a venerable villager with a straight white beard -- sat on a mat just outside the door with his sons , daughters , sons-in-law , their wives , and , I should think , half the population of his village besides , squatting or standing around him . A slim dark woman , with part of her back and one black shoulder bared , and with a thin gold ring in her nose , suddenly began to talk in a high-pitched , shrewish tone . The man with me instinctively looked up at her . We were then just through the door , passing behind Jim ’ s burly back . ‘ Whether those villagers had brought the yellow dog with them , I don ’ t know . Anyhow , a dog was there , weaving himself in and out amongst people ’ s legs in that mute stealthy way native dogs have , and my companion stumbled over him . The dog leaped away without a sound ; the man , raising his voice a little , said with a slow laugh , “ Look at that wretched cur , ” and directly afterwards we became separated by a lot of people pushing in . I stood back for a moment against the wall while the stranger managed to get down the steps and disappeared . I saw Jim spin round . He made a step forward and barred my way . We were alone ; he glared at me with an air of stubborn resolution . I became aware I was being held up , so to speak , as if in a wood . The verandah was empty by then , the noise and movement in court had ceased : a great silence fell upon the building , in which , somewhere far within , an oriental voice began to whine abjectly . The dog , in the very act of trying to sneak in at the door , sat down hurriedly to hunt for fleas . ‘ “ Did you speak to me ? ” asked Jim very low , and bending forward , not so much towards me but at me , if you know what I mean . I said “ No ” at once . Something in the sound of that quiet tone of his warned me to be on my defence . I watched him . It was very much like a meeting in a wood , only more uncertain in its issue , since he could possibly want neither my money nor my life -- nothing that I could simply give up or defend with a clear conscience . “ You say you didn ’ t , ” he said , very sombre . “ But I heard. ” “ Some mistake , ” I protested , utterly at a loss , and never taking my eyes off him . To watch his face was like watching a darkening sky before a clap of thunder , shade upon shade imperceptibly coming on , the doom growing mysteriously intense in the calm of maturing violence . ‘ “ As far as I know , I haven ’ t opened my lips in your hearing , ” I affirmed with perfect truth . I was getting a little angry , too , at the absurdity of this encounter . It strikes me now I have never in my life been so near a beating -- I mean it literally ; a beating with fists . I suppose I had some hazy prescience of that eventuality being in the air . Not that he was actively threatening me . On the contrary , he was strangely passive -- don ’ t you know ? but he was lowering , and , though not exceptionally big , he looked generally fit to demolish a wall . The most reassuring symptom I noticed was a kind of slow and ponderous hesitation , which I took as a tribute to the evident sincerity of my manner and of my tone . We faced each other . In the court the assault case was proceeding . I caught the words : “ Well -- buffalo -- stick -- in the greatness of my fear . . . . ” ‘ “ What did you mean by staring at me all the morning ? ” said Jim at last . He looked up and looked down again . “ Did you expect us all to sit with downcast eyes out of regard for your susceptibilities ? ” I retorted sharply . I was not going to submit meekly to any of his nonsense . He raised his eyes again , and this time continued to look me straight in the face . “ No . That ’ s all right , ” he pronounced with an air of deliberating with himself upon the truth of this statement -- “ that ’ s all right . I am going through with that . Only ” -- and there he spoke a little faster -- “ I won ’ t let any man call me names outside this court . There was a fellow with you . You spoke to him -- oh yes -- I know ; ‘ tis all very fine . You spoke to him , but you meant me to hear . . . . ” ‘ I assured him he was under some extraordinary delusion . I had no conception how it came about . “ You thought I would be afraid to resent this , ” he said , with just a faint tinge of bitterness . I was interested enough to discern the slightest shades of expression , but I was not in the least enlightened ; yet I don ’ t know what in these words , or perhaps just the intonation of that phrase , induced me suddenly to make all possible allowances for him . I ceased to be annoyed at my unexpected predicament . It was some mistake on his part ; he was blundering , and I had an intuition that the blunder was of an odious , of an unfortunate nature . I was anxious to end this scene on grounds of decency , just as one is anxious to cut short some unprovoked and abominable confidence . The funniest part was , that in the midst of all these considerations of the higher order I was conscious of a certain trepidation as to the possibility -- nay , likelihood -- of this encounter ending in some disreputable brawl which could not possibly be explained , and would make me ridiculous . I did not hanker after a three days ’ celebrity as the man who got a black eye or something of the sort from the mate of the Patna . He , in all probability , did not care what he did , or at any rate would be fully justified in his own eyes . It took no magician to see he was amazingly angry about something , for all his quiet and even torpid demeanour . I don ’ t deny I was extremely desirous to pacify him at all costs , had I only known what to do . But I didn ’ t know , as you may well imagine . It was a blackness without a single gleam . We confronted each other in silence . He hung fire for about fifteen seconds , then made a step nearer , and I made ready to ward off a blow , though I don ’ t think I moved a muscle . “ If you were as big as two men and as strong as six , ” he said very softly , “ I would tell you what I think of you . You . . . ” “ Stop ! ” I exclaimed . This checked him for a second . “ Before you tell me what you think of me , ” I went on quickly , “ will you kindly tell me what it is I ’ ve said or done ? ” During the pause that ensued he surveyed me with indignation , while I made supernatural efforts of memory , in which I was hindered by the oriental voice within the court-room expostulating with impassioned volubility against a charge of falsehood . Then we spoke almost together . “ I will soon show you I am not , ” he said , in a tone suggestive of a crisis . “ I declare I don ’ t know , ” I protested earnestly at the same time . He tried to crush me by the scorn of his glance . “ Now that you see I am not afraid you try to crawl out of it , ” he said . “ Who ’ s a cur now -- hey ? ” Then , at last , I understood . ‘ He had been scanning my features as though looking for a place where he would plant his fist . “ I will allow no man , ” . . . he mumbled threateningly . It was , indeed , a hideous mistake ; he had given himself away utterly . I can ’ t give you an idea how shocked I was . I suppose he saw some reflection of my feelings in my face , because his expression changed just a little . “ Good God ! ” I stammered , “ you don ’ t think I . . . ” “ But I am sure I ’ ve heard , ” he persisted , raising his voice for the first time since the beginning of this deplorable scene . Then with a shade of disdain he added , “ It wasn ’ t you , then ? Very well ; I ’ ll find the other. ” “ Don ’ t be a fool , ” I cried in exasperation ; “ it wasn ’ t that at all. ” “ I ’ ve heard , ” he said again with an unshaken and sombre perseverance . ‘ There may be those who could have laughed at his pertinacity ; I didn ’ t . Oh , I didn ’ t ! There had never been a man so mercilessly shown up by his own natural impulse . A single word had stripped him of his discretion -- of that discretion which is more necessary to the decencies of our inner being than clothing is to the decorum of our body . “ Don ’ t be a fool , ” I repeated . “ But the other man said it , you don ’ t deny that ? ” he pronounced distinctly , and looking in my face without flinching . “ No , I don ’ t deny , ” said I , returning his gaze . At last his eyes followed downwards the direction of my pointing finger . He appeared at first uncomprehending , then confounded , and at last amazed and scared as though a dog had been a monster and he had never seen a dog before . “ Nobody dreamt of insulting you , ” I said . ‘ He contemplated the wretched animal , that moved no more than an effigy : it sat with ears pricked and its sharp muzzle pointed into the doorway , and suddenly snapped at a fly like a piece of mechanism . ‘ I looked at him . The red of his fair sunburnt complexion deepened suddenly under the down of his cheeks , invaded his forehead , spread to the roots of his curly hair . His ears became intensely crimson , and even the clear blue of his eyes was darkened many shades by the rush of blood to his head . His lips pouted a little , trembling as though he had been on the point of bursting into tears . I perceived he was incapable of pronouncing a word from the excess of his humiliation . From disappointment too -- who knows ? Perhaps he looked forward to that hammering he was going to give me for rehabilitation , for appeasement ? Who can tell what relief he expected from this chance of a row ? He was naive enough to expect anything ; but he had given himself away for nothing in this case . He had been frank with himself -- let alone with me -- in the wild hope of arriving in that way at some effective refutation , and the stars had been ironically unpropitious . He made an inarticulate noise in his throat like a man imperfectly stunned by a blow on the head . It was pitiful . ‘ I didn ’ t catch up again with him till well outside the gate . I had even to trot a bit at the last , but when , out of breath at his elbow , I taxed him with running away , he said , “ Never ! ” and at once turned at bay . I explained I never meant to say he was running away from _me_ . “ From no man -- from not a single man on earth , ” he affirmed with a stubborn mien . I forbore to point out the one obvious exception which would hold good for the bravest of us ; I thought he would find out by himself very soon . He looked at me patiently while I was thinking of something to say , but I could find nothing on the spur of the moment , and he began to walk on . I kept up , and anxious not to lose him , I said hurriedly that I couldn ’ t think of leaving him under a false impression of my -- of my -- I stammered . The stupidity of the phrase appalled me while I was trying to finish it , but the power of sentences has nothing to do with their sense or the logic of their construction . My idiotic mumble seemed to please him . He cut it short by saying , with courteous placidity that argued an immense power of self-control or else a wonderful elasticity of spirits -- “ Altogether my mistake. ” I marvelled greatly at this expression : he might have been alluding to some trifling occurrence . Hadn ’ t he understood its deplorable meaning ? “ You may well forgive me , ” he continued , and went on a little moodily , “ All these staring people in court seemed such fools that -- that it might have been as I supposed. ” ‘ This opened suddenly a new view of him to my wonder . I looked at him curiously and met his unabashed and impenetrable eyes . “ I can ’ t put up with this kind of thing , ” he said , very simply , “ and I don ’ t mean to . In court it ’ s different ; I ’ ve got to stand that -- and I can do it too. ” ‘ I don ’ t pretend I understood him . The views he let me have of himself were like those glimpses through the shifting rents in a thick fog -- bits of vivid and vanishing detail , giving no connected idea of the general aspect of a country . They fed one ’ s curiosity without satisfying it ; they were no good for purposes of orientation . Upon the whole he was misleading . That ’ s how I summed him up to myself after he left me late in the evening . I had been staying at the Malabar House for a few days , and on my pressing invitation he dined with me there. ’ CHAPTER 7 ‘ An outward-bound mail-boat had come in that afternoon , and the big dining-room of the hotel was more than half full of people with a-hundred-pounds-round-the-world tickets in their pockets . There were married couples looking domesticated and bored with each other in the midst of their travels ; there were small parties and large parties , and lone individuals dining solemnly or feasting boisterously , but all thinking , conversing , joking , or scowling as was their wont at home ; and just as intelligently receptive of new impressions as their trunks upstairs . Henceforth they would be labelled as having passed through this and that place , and so would be their luggage . They would cherish this distinction of their persons , and preserve the gummed tickets on their portmanteaus as documentary evidence , as the only permanent trace of their improving enterprise . The dark-faced servants tripped without noise over the vast and polished floor ; now and then a girl ’ s laugh would be heard , as innocent and empty as her mind , or , in a sudden hush of crockery , a few words in an affected drawl from some wit embroidering for the benefit of a grinning tableful the last funny story of shipboard scandal . Two nomadic old maids , dressed up to kill , worked acrimoniously through the bill of fare , whispering to each other with faded lips , wooden-faced and bizarre , like two sumptuous scarecrows . A little wine opened Jim ’ s heart and loosened his tongue . His appetite was good , too , I noticed . He seemed to have buried somewhere the opening episode of our acquaintance . It was like a thing of which there would be no more question in this world . And all the time I had before me these blue , boyish eyes looking straight into mine , this young face , these capable shoulders , the open bronzed forehead with a white line under the roots of clustering fair hair , this appearance appealing at sight to all my sympathies : this frank aspect , the artless smile , the youthful seriousness . He was of the right sort ; he was one of us . He talked soberly , with a sort of composed unreserve , and with a quiet bearing that might have been the outcome of manly self-control , of impudence , of callousness , of a colossal unconsciousness , of a gigantic deception . Who can tell ! From our tone we might have been discussing a third person , a football match , last year ’ s weather . My mind floated in a sea of conjectures till the turn of the conversation enabled me , without being offensive , to remark that , upon the whole , this inquiry must have been pretty trying to him . He darted his arm across the tablecloth , and clutching my hand by the side of my plate , glared fixedly . I was startled . “ It must be awfully hard , ” I stammered , confused by this display of speechless feeling . “ It is -- hell , ” he burst out in a muffled voice . ‘ This movement and these words caused two well-groomed male globe-trotters at a neighbouring table to look up in alarm from their iced pudding . I rose , and we passed into the front gallery for coffee and cigars . ‘ On little octagon tables candles burned in glass globes ; clumps of stiff-leaved plants separated sets of cosy wicker chairs ; and between the pairs of columns , whose reddish shafts caught in a long row the sheen from the tall windows , the night , glittering and sombre , seemed to hang like a splendid drapery . The riding lights of ships winked afar like setting stars , and the hills across the roadstead resembled rounded black masses of arrested thunder-clouds . ‘ “ I couldn ’ t clear out , ” Jim began . “ The skipper did -- that ’ s all very well for him . I couldn ’ t , and I wouldn ’ t . They all got out of it in one way or another , but it wouldn ’ t do for me. ” ‘ I listened with concentrated attention , not daring to stir in my chair ; I wanted to know -- and to this day I don ’ t know , I can only guess . He would be confident and depressed all in the same breath , as if some conviction of innate blamelessness had checked the truth writhing within him at every turn . He began by saying , in the tone in which a man would admit his inability to jump a twenty-foot wall , that he could never go home now ; and this declaration recalled to my mind what Brierly had said , “ that the old parson in Essex seemed to fancy his sailor son not a little. ” ‘ I can ’ t tell you whether Jim knew he was especially “ fancied , ” but the tone of his references to “ my Dad ” was calculated to give me a notion that the good old rural dean was about the finest man that ever had been worried by the cares of a large family since the beginning of the world . This , though never stated , was implied with an anxiety that there should be no mistake about it , which was really very true and charming , but added a poignant sense of lives far off to the other elements of the story . “ He has seen it all in the home papers by this time , ” said Jim . “ I can never face the poor old chap. ” I did not dare to lift my eyes at this till I heard him add , “ I could never explain . He wouldn ’ t understand. ” Then I looked up . He was smoking reflectively , and after a moment , rousing himself , began to talk again . He discovered at once a desire that I should not confound him with his partners in -- in crime , let us call it . He was not one of them ; he was altogether of another sort . I gave no sign of dissent . I had no intention , for the sake of barren truth , to rob him of the smallest particle of any saving grace that would come in his way . I didn ’ t know how much of it he believed himself . I didn ’ t know what he was playing up to -- if he was playing up to anything at all -- and I suspect he did not know either ; for it is my belief no man ever understands quite his own artful dodges to escape from the grim shadow of self-knowledge . I made no sound all the time he was wondering what he had better do after “ that stupid inquiry was over. ” ‘ Apparently he shared Brierly ’ s contemptuous opinion of these proceedings ordained by law . He would not know where to turn , he confessed , clearly thinking aloud rather than talking to me . Certificate gone , career broken , no money to get away , no work that he could obtain as far as he could see . At home he could perhaps get something ; but it meant going to his people for help , and that he would not do . He saw nothing for it but ship before the mast -- could get perhaps a quartermaster ’ s billet in some steamer . Would do for a quartermaster . . . . “ Do you think you would ? ” I asked pitilessly . He jumped up , and going to the stone balustrade looked out into the night . In a moment he was back , towering above my chair with his youthful face clouded yet by the pain of a conquered emotion . He had understood very well I did not doubt his ability to steer a ship . In a voice that quavered a bit he asked me why did I say that ? I had been “ no end kind ” to him . I had not even laughed at him when -- here he began to mumble -- “ that mistake , you know -- made a confounded ass of myself. ” I broke in by saying rather warmly that for me such a mistake was not a matter to laugh at . He sat down and drank deliberately some coffee , emptying the small cup to the last drop . “ That does not mean I admit for a moment the cap fitted , ” he declared distinctly . “ No ? ” I said . “ No , ” he affirmed with quiet decision . “ Do you know what _you_ would have done ? Do you ? And you don ’ t think yourself ” . . . he gulped something . . . “ you don ’ t think yourself a -- a -- cur ? ” ‘ And with this -- upon my honour ! -- he looked up at me inquisitively . It was a question it appears -- a bona fide question ! However , he didn ’ t wait for an answer . Before I could recover he went on , with his eyes straight before him , as if reading off something written on the body of the night . “ It is all in being ready . I wasn ’ t ; not -- not then . I don ’ t want to excuse myself ; but I would like to explain -- I would like somebody to understand -- somebody -- one person at least ! You ! Why not you ? ” ‘ It",Lord Jim

INDEX . GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON VOLCANIC ISLANDS . CRITICAL INTRODUCTION . The second volume of the series , entitled “ Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands , with Brief Notices on the Geology of Australia and the Cape of Good Hope , ” made its appearance in 1844 . He had been reading Humboldt ’ s “ Personal Narrative ” during his last year ’ s residence in Cambridge , and had copied out from it long passages about Teneriffe . He was actually making inquiries as to the best means of visiting that island , when the offer was made to him to accompany Captain Fitzroy in the “ Beagle . “ His friend Henslow too , on parting with him , had given him the advice to procure and read the recently published first volume of the “ Principles of Geology , ” though he warned him against accepting the views advocated by its author . We may therefore form an idea of his feelings when , on the ship reaching Santa Cruz , and the Peak of Teneriffe making its appearance among the clouds , they were suddenly informed that an outbreak of cholera would prevent any landing ! Ample compensation for this disappointment was found , however , when the ship reached Porta Praya in St. Jago , the largest of the Cape de Verde Islands . Here he spent three most delightful weeks , and really commenced his work as a geologist and naturalist . Writing to his father he says , “ Geologising in a volcanic country is most delightful ; besides the interest attached to itself , it leads you into most beautiful and retired spots . Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine the pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and coffee-plants , and an endless number of wild flowers . And this island , that has given me so much instruction and delight , is reckoned the most uninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage . It certainly is generally very barren , but the valleys are more exquisitely beautiful , from the very contrast . It is utterly useless to say anything about the scenery ; it would be as profitable to explain to a blind man colours , as to a person who has not been out of Europe , the total dissimilarity of a tropical view . Whenever I enjoy anything , I always look forward to writing it down , either in my log-book ( which increases in bulk ) , or in a letter ; so you must excuse raptures , and those raptures badly expressed . “ The geology of St. Jago is very striking , yet simple ; a stream of lava formerly flowed over the bed of the sea , formed of triturated recent shells and corals , which it has baked into a hard white rock . Since then the whole island has been upheaved . But the line of white rock revealed to me a new and important fact , namely that there had been afterwards subsidence round the craters which had since been in action , and had poured forth lava . It then first dawned on me that I might perhaps write a book on the geology of the various countries visited , and this made me thrill with delight . He accordingly , at the end of 1836 , took lodgings for three months in Fitzwilliam Street , Cambridge , so as to be near Henslow ; and in studying and determining his geological specimens received much valuable aid from the eminent crystallographer and mineralogist , Professor William Hallows Miller . Writing to his friend Mr. Fox , on March 28th , 1843 , he says , “ I am very slowly progressing with a volume , or rather pamphlet , on the volcanic islands which we visited : I manage only a couple of hours per day , and that not very regularly . He wrote to Lyell , “ You have pleased me much by saying that you intend looking through my ‘ Volcanic Islands ; ’ it cost me eighteen months ! ! ! and I have heard of very few who have read it . Now I shall feel , whatever little ( and little it is ) there is confirmatory of old work , or new , will work its effect and not be lost. ” To Sir Joseph Hooker he wrote , “ I have just finished a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited . Probably the scant satisfaction which its author seemed to find in it may be traced to the effect of a contrast which he felt between the memory of glowing delights he had experienced when , hammer in hand , he roamed over new and interesting scenes , and the slow , laborious , and less congenial task of re-writing and arranging his notes in book-form . I was much gratified when he gave way upon the point , and consented to their appearing just as originally issued . The merit of the work consisted in supplying interesting observations , which in some cases have proved of crucial value in exploding prevalent fallacies ; in calling attention to phenomena and considerations that had been quite overlooked by geologists , but have since exercised an important influence in moulding geological speculation ; and lastly in showing the importance which attaches to small and seemingly insignificant causes , some of which afford a key to the explanation of very curious geological problems . The views originally put forward by the old German geologist and traveller , and almost universally accepted by his countrymen , had met with much support from Elie de Beaumont and Dufrenoy , the leaders of geological thought in France . They were , however , stoutly opposed by Scrope and Lyell in this country , and by Constant Prevost and Virlet on the other side of the channel . Admitting the influence of the injection of lava into the structure of the volcanic cones , in increasing their bulk and elevation , he shows that , in the main , the volcanoes are built up by repeated ejections causing an accumulation of materials around the vent . The importance of this agency , to which too little attention has been directed by geologists , has recently been shown by Professor Dana , in his admirable work on Kilauea and the other great volcanoes of the Hawaiian Archipelago . Striking illustrations of the same principle have since been pointed out by M. Robert and others in Iceland , by Mr. Heaphy in New Zealand , and by myself in the Western Isles of Scotland . But he , at the same time , clearly saw that there was no evidence of the occurrence of great deluges of lava along such fissures ; he showed how the most remarkable plateaux , composed of successive lava sheets , might be built up by repeated and moderate ejections from numerous isolated vents ; and he expressly insists upon the rapidity with which the cinder-cones around the orifices of ejection and the evidences of successive outflows of lava would be obliterated by denudation . One of the most striking parts of the book is that in which he deals with the effects of denudation in producing “ basal wrecks ” or worn down stumps of volcanoes . He was enabled to examine a series of cases in which could be traced every gradation , from perfect volcanic cones down to the solidified plugs which had consolidated in the vents from which ejections had taken place . Like Lyell , he was firmly persuaded of the continuity of geological history , and ever delighted in finding indications , in the present order of nature , that the phenomena of the past could be accounted for by means of causes which are still in operation . It was indeed a fortunate circumstance , that after studying some excellent examples of recent volcanic rocks , he proceeded to examine in South America many fine illustrations of the older igneous rock-masses , and especially of the most highly crystalline types of the same , and then on his way home had opportunities of reviving the impression made upon him by the fresh and unaltered volcanic rocks . Some of the general considerations suggested by these observations were discussed in a paper read by him before the Geological Society , on March 7th , 1838 , under the title “ On the Connection of Certain Volcanic Phenomena , and On the Formation of Mountain-chains , and the Effect of Continental Elevations. ” The exact bearing of these two classes of facts upon one another are more fully discussed in his book on South American geology . In this way he was able to map out the oceanic areas in different zones , along which opposite kinds of movement were taking place . His conclusions on this subject were full of novelty and suggestiveness . In his “ Origin of Species ” he has elaborated the idea and suggested the theory of the permanence of ocean-basins , a suggestion which has been adopted and pushed farther by subsequent authors , than we think its originator would have approved . His caution and fairness of mind on this and similar speculative questions was well-known to all who were in the habit of discussing them with him . Some years before the voyage of the “ Beagle , ” Mr. Poulett Scrope had pointed out the remarkable analogies that exist between certain igneous rocks of banded structure , as seen in the Ponza Islands , and the foliated crystalline schists . Since his day , the method of study of rocks by thin sections under the microscope has been devised , and has become a most efficient aid in all petrographical inquiries .

A calcareous sedimentary deposit , with recent shells , altered by the contact of superincumbent lava , its horizontality and extent . Subsequent volcanic eruptions , associated with calcareous matter in an earthy and fibrous form , and often enclosed within the separate cells of the scoriae . Ancient and obliterated orifices of eruption of small size . Difficulty of tracing over a bare plain recent streams of lava . Inland hills of more ancient volcanic rock . Decomposed olivine in large masses . Feldspathic rocks beneath the upper crystalline basaltic strata . Uniform structure and form of the more ancient volcanic hills . Form of the valleys near the coast . Conglomerate now forming on the sea beach . ( FIGURE 1 : MAP 1 : PART OF ST. JAGO , ONE OF THE CAPE DE VERDE ISLANDS . ) The island of St. Jago extends in a N.N.W . and S.S.E . direction , thirty miles in length by about twelve in breadth . My observations , made during two visits , were confined to the southern portion within the distance of a few leagues from Porto Praya . The country , viewed from the sea , presents a varied outline : smooth conical hills of a reddish colour ( like Red Hill in Figure 1 ( Map 1 ) . ( The outline of the coast , the position of the villages , streamlets , and of most of the hills in this woodcut , are copied from the chart made on board H.M.S . “ Leven. ” The square-topped hills ( A , B , C , etc . ) are put in merely by eye , to illustrate my description . ) ) , and others less regular , flat-topped , and of a blackish colour ( like A , B , C , ) rise from successive , step-formed plains of lava . At a distance , a chain of mountains , many thousand feet in height , traverses the interior of the island . There is no active volcano in St. Jago , and only one in the group , namely at Fogo . The island since being inhabited has not suffered from destructive earthquakes . The lowest rocks exposed on the coast near Porto Praya , are highly crystalline and compact ; they appear to be of ancient , submarine , volcanic origin ; they are unconformably covered by a thin , irregular , calcareous deposit , abounding with shells of a late tertiary period ; and this again is capped by a wide sheet of basaltic lava , which has flowed in successive streams from the interior of the island , between the square-topped hills marked A , B , C , etc . Still more recent streams of lava have been erupted from the scattered cones , such as Red and Signal Post Hills . The upper strata of the square-topped hills are intimately related in mineralogical composition , and in other respects , with the lowest series of the coast- rocks , with which they seem to be continuous . MINERALOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ROCKS OF THE LOWEST SERIES . These rocks possess an extremely varying character ; they consist of black , brown , and grey , compact , basaltic bases , with numerous crystals of augite , hornblende , olivine , mica , and sometimes glassy feldspar . A common variety is almost entirely composed of crystals of augite with olivine . Mica , it is known , seldom occurs where augite abounds ; nor probably does the present case offer a real exception , for the mica ( at least in my best characterised specimen , in which one nodule of this mineral is nearly half an inch in length ) is as perfectly rounded as a pebble in a conglomerate , and evidently has not been crystallised in the base , in which it is now enclosed , but has proceeded from the fusion of some pre-existing rock . These compact lavas alternate with tuffs , amygdaloids , and wacke , and in some places with coarse conglomerate . Some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green colour , others , pale yellowish-green , and others nearly white ; I was surprised to find that some of the latter varieties , even where whitest , fused into a jet black enamel , whilst some of the green varieties afforded only a pale gray bead . Numerous dikes , consisting chiefly of highly compact augitic rocks , and of gray amygdaloidal varieties , intersect the strata , which have in several places been dislocated with considerable violence , and thrown into highly inclined positions . One line of disturbance crosses the northern end of Quail Island ( an islet in the Bay of Porto Praya ) , and can be followed to the mainland . These disturbances took place before the deposition of the recent sedimentary bed ; and the surface , also , had previously been denuded to a great extent , as is shown by many truncated dikes . DESCRIPTION OF THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT OVERLYING THE FOREGOING VOLCANIC ROCKS . This stratum is very conspicuous from its white colour , and from the extreme regularity with which it ranges in a horizontal line for some miles along the coast . Its average height above the sea , measured from the upper line of junction with the superincumbent basaltic lava , is about sixty feet ; and its thickness , although varying much from the inequalities of the underlying formation , may be estimated at about twenty feet . It consists of quite white calcareous matter , partly composed of organic debris , and partly of a substance which may be aptly compared in appearance with mortar . Fragments of rock and pebbles are scattered throughout this bed , often forming , especially in the lower part , a conglomerate . Many of the fragments of rock are whitewashed with a thin coating of calcareous matter . At Quail Island , the calcareous deposit is replaced in its lowest part by a soft , brown , earthy tuff , full of Turritellae ; this is covered by a bed of pebbles , passing into sandstone , and mixed with fragments of echini , claws of crabs , and shells ; the oyster-shells still adhering to the rock on which they grew . Numerous white balls appearing like pisolitic concretions , from the size of a walnut to that of an apple , are embedded in this deposit ; they usually have a small pebble in their centres . Although so like concretions , a close examination convinced me that they were Nulliporae , retaining their proper forms , but with their surfaces slightly abraded : these bodies ( plants as they are now generally considered to be ) exhibit under a microscope of ordinary power , no traces of organisation in their internal structure . Mr. George R. Sowerby has been so good as to examine the shells which I collected : there are fourteen species in a sufficiently perfect condition for their characters to be made out with some degree of certainty , and four which can be referred only to their genera . Of the fourteen shells , of which a list is given in the Appendix , eleven are recent species ; one , though undescribed , is perhaps identical with a species which I found living in the harbour of Porto Praya ; the two remaining species are unknown , and have been described by Mr. Sowerby . Until the shells of this Archipelago and of the neighbouring coasts are better known , it would be rash to assert that even these two latter shells are extinct . The number of species which certainly belong to existing kinds , although few in number , are sufficient to show that the deposit belongs to a late tertiary period . From its mineralogical character , from the number and size of the embedded fragments , and from the abundance of Patellae , and other littoral shells , it is evident that the whole was accumulated in a shallow sea , near an ancient coast-line . EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE FLOWING OF THE SUPERINCUMBENT BASALTIC LAVA OVER THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT . These effects are very curious . The calcareous matter is altered to the depth of about a foot beneath the line of junction ; and a most perfect gradation can be traced , from loosely aggregated , small , particles of shells , corallines , and Nulliporae , into a rock , in which not a trace of mechanical origin can be discovered , even with a microscope . Where the metamorphic change has been greatest , two varieties occur . The first is a hard , compact , white , fine-grained rock , striped with a few parallel lines of black volcanic particles , and resembling a sandstone , but which , upon close examination , is seen to be crystallised throughout , with the cleavages so perfect that they can be readily measured by the reflecting goniometer . In specimens , where the change has been less complete , when moistened and examined under a strong lens , the most interesting gradation can be traced , some of the rounded particles retaining their proper forms , and others insensibly melting into the granulo-crystalline paste . The weathered surface of this stone , as is so frequently the case with ordinary limestones , assumes a brick-red colour . The second metamorphosed variety is likewise a hard rock , but without any crystalline structure . It consists of a white , opaque , compact , calcareous stone , thickly mottled with rounded , though regular , spots of a soft , earthy , ochraceous substance . This earthy matter is of a pale yellowish- brown colour , and appears to be a mixture of carbonate of lime with iron ; it effervesces with acids , is infusible , but blackens under the blowpipe , and becomes magnetic . The rounded form of the minute patches of earthy substance , and the steps in the progress of their perfect formation , which can be followed in a suit of specimens , clearly show that they are due either to some power of aggregation in the earthy particles amongst themselves , or more probably to a strong attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of line , and consequently to the segregation of the earthy extraneous matter . I was much interested by this fact , because I have often seen quartz rocks ( for instance , in the Falkland Islands , and in the lower Silurian strata of the Stiper-stones in Shropshire ) , mottled in a precisely analogous manner , with little spots of a white , earthy substance ( earthy feldspar ? ) ; and these rocks , there was good reason to suppose , had undergone the action of heat , —a view which thus receives confirmation . This spotted structure may possibly afford some indication in distinguishing those formations of quartz , which owe their present structure to igneous action , from those produced by the agency of water alone ; a source of doubt , which I should think from my own experience , that most geologists , when examining arenaceo-quartzose districts must have experienced . The lowest and most scoriaceous part of the lava , in rolling over the sedimentary deposit at the bottom of the sea , has caught up large quantities of calcareous matter , which now forms a snow-white , highly crystalline basis to a breccia , including small pieces of black , glossy scoriae . A little above this , where the lime is less abundant , and the lava more compact , numerous little balls , composed of spicula of calcareous spar , radiating from common centres , occupy the interstices . In one part of Quail Island , the lime has thus been crystallised by the heat of the superincumbent lava , where it is only thirteen feet in thickness ; nor had the lava been originally thicker , and since reduced by degradation , as could be told from the degree of cellularity of its surface . I have already observed that the sea must have been shallow in which the calcareous deposit was accumulated . In this case , therefore , the carbonic acid gas has been retained under a pressure , insignificant compared with that ( a column of water , 1,708 feet in height ) originally supposed by Sir James Hall to be requisite for this end : but since his experiments , it has been discovered that pressure has less to do with the retention of carbonic acid gas , than the nature of the circumjacent atmosphere ; and hence , as is stated to be the case by Mr. Faraday , masses of limestone are sometimes fused and crystallised even in common limekilns . ( I am much indebted to Mr. E.W . Brayley in having given me the following references to papers on this subject : Faraday in the “ Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal ” volume 15 page 398 ; Gay-Lussac in “ Annales de Chem . et Phys. ” tome 63 page 219 translated in the “ London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine ” volume 10 page 496 . ) Carbonate of lime can be heated to almost any degree , according to Faraday , in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas , without being decomposed ; and Gay-Lussac found that fragments of limestone , placed in a tube and heated to a degree , not sufficient by itself to cause their decomposition , yet immediately evolved their carbonic acid , when a stream of common air or steam was passed over them : Gay-Lussac attributes this to the mechanical displacement of the nascent carbonic acid gas . The calcareous matter beneath the lava , and especially that forming the crystalline spicula between the interstices of the scoriae , although heated in an atmosphere probably composed chiefly of steam , could not have been subjected to the effects of a passing stream ; and hence it is , perhaps , that they have retained their carbonic acid , under a small amount of pressure . The fragments of scoriae , embedded in the crystalline calcareous basis , are of a jet black colour , with a glossy fracture like pitchstone . Their surfaces , however , are coated with a layer of a reddish-orange , translucent substance , which can easily be scratched with a knife ; hence they appear as if overlaid by a thin layer of rosin . Some of the smaller fragments are partially changed throughout into this substance : a change which appears quite different from ordinary decomposition . At the Galapagos Archipelago ( as will be described in a future chapter ) , great beds are formed of volcanic ashes and particles of scoriae , which have undergone a closely similar change . THE EXTENT AND HORIZONTALITY OF THE CALCAREOUS STRATUM . ( FIGURE 2 : SIGNAL POST HILL . ( Section with A low and C high . ) A.—Ancient volcanic rocks . B.—Calcareous stratum . C.—Upper basaltic lava . ) The upper line of surface of the calcareous stratum , which is so conspicuous from being quite white and so nearly horizontal , ranges for miles along the coast , at the height of about sixty feet above the sea . The sheet of basalt , by which it is capped , is on an average eighty feet in thickness . Westward of Porto Praya beyond Red Hill , the white stratum with the superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent streams . Northward of Signal Post Hill , I could follow it with my eye , trending away for several miles along the sea cliffs . The distance thus observed is about seven miles ; but I can not doubt from its regularity that it extends much farther . In some ravines at right angles to the coast , it is seen gently dipping towards the sea , probably with the same inclination as when deposited round the ancient shores of the island . I found only one inland section , namely , at the base of the hill marked A , where , at the height of some hundred feet , this bed was exposed ; it here rested on the usual compact augitic rock associated with wacke , and was covered by the widespread sheet of modern basaltic lava . Some exceptions occur to the horizontality of the white stratum : at Quail Island , its upper surface is only forty feet above the level of the sea ; here also the capping of lava is only between twelve and fifteen feet in thickness ; on the other hand , at the north-east side of Porto Praya harbour , the calcareous stratum , as well as the rock on which it rests , attain a height above the average level : the inequality of level in these two cases is not , as I believe , owing to unequal elevation , but to original irregularities at the bottom of the sea . Of this fact , at Quail Island , there was clear evidence in the calcareous deposit being in one part of much greater than the average thickness , and in another part being entirely absent ; in this latter case , the modern basaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin . Under Signal Post Hill , the white stratum dips into the sea in a remarkable manner . This hill is conical , 450 feet in height , and retains some traces of having had a crateriform structure ; it is composed chiefly of matter erupted posteriorly to the elevation of the great basaltic plain , but partly of lava of apparently submarine origin and of considerable antiquity . The surrounding plain , as well as the eastern flank of this hill , has been worn into steep precipices , overhanging the sea . In these precipices , the white calcareous stratum may be seen , at the height of about seventy feet above the beach , running for some miles both northward and southward of the hill , in a line appearing to be perfectly horizontal ; but for a space of a quarter of a mile directly under the hill , it dips into the sea and disappears . On the south side the dip is gradual , on the north side it is more abrupt , as is shown in Figure 2 . As neither the calcareous stratum , nor the superincumbent basaltic lava ( as far as the latter can be distinguished from the more modern ejections ) , appears to thicken as it dips , I infer that these strata were not originally accumulated in a trough , the centre of which afterwards became a point of eruption ; but that they have subsequently been disturbed and bent . We may suppose either that Signal Post Hill subsided after its elevation with the surrounding country , or that it never was uplifted to the same height with it . This latter seems to me the most probable alternative , for during the slow and equable elevation of this portion of the island , the subterranean motive power , from expending part of its force in repeatedly erupting volcanic matter from beneath this point , would , it is likely , have less force to uplift it . Something of the same kind seems to have occurred near Red Hill , for when tracing upwards the naked streams of lava from near Porto Praya towards the interior of the island , I was strongly induced to suspect , that since the lava had flowed , the slope of the land had been slightly modified , either by a small subsidence near Red Hill , or by that portion of the plain having been uplifted to a less height during the elevation of the whole area . THE BASALTIC LAVA , SUPERINCUMBENT ON THE CALCAREOUS DEPOSIT . This lava is of a pale grey colour , fusing into a black enamel ; its fracture is rather earthy and concretionary ; it contains olivine in small grains . The central parts of the mass are compact , or at most crenulated with a few minute cavities , and are often columnar . At Quail Island this structure was assumed in a striking manner ; the lava in one part being divided into horizontal laminae , which became in another part split by vertical fissures into five-sided plates ; and these again , being piled on each other , insensibly became soldered together , forming fine symmetrical columns . The lower surface of the lava is vesicular , but sometimes only to the thickness of a few inches ; the upper surface , which is likewise vesicular , is divided into balls , frequently as much as three feet in diameter , made up of concentric layers . The mass is composed of more than one stream ; its total thickness being , on an average , about eighty feet : the lower portion has certainly flowed beneath the sea , and probably likewise the upper portion . The chief part of this lava has flowed from the central districts , between the hills marked A , B , C , etc. , in the woodcut- map . The surface of the country , near the coast , is level and barren ; towards the interior , the land rises by successive terraces , of which four , when viewed from a distance , could be distinctly counted . VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ELEVATION OF THE COASTLAND ; THE EJECTED MATTER ASSOCIATED WITH EARTHY LIME . These recent lavas have proceeded from those scattered , conical , reddish- coloured hills , which rise abruptly from the plain-country near the coast . I ascended some of them , but will describe only one , namely , RED HILL , which may serve as a type of its class , and is remarkable in some especial respects . Its height is about six hundred feet ; it is composed of bright red , highly scoriaceous rock of a basaltic nature ; on one side of its summit there is a hollow , probably the last remnant of a crater . Several of the other hills of this class , judging from their external forms , are surmounted by much more perfect craters . When sailing along the coast , it was evident that a considerable body of lava had flowed from Red Hill , over a line of cliff about one hundred and twenty feet in height , into the sea : this line of cliff is continuous with that forming the coast , and bounding the plain on both sides of this hill ; these streams , therefore , were erupted , after the formation of the coast-cliffs , from Red Hill , when it must have stood , as it now does , above the level of the sea . This conclusion accords with the highly scoriaceous condition of all the rock on it , appearing to be of subaerial formation : and this is important , as there are some beds of calcareous matter near its summit , which might , at a hasty glance , have been mistaken for a submarine deposit . These beds consist of white , earthy , carbonate of lime , extremely friable so as to be crushed with the least pressure ; the most compact specimens not resisting the strength of the fingers . Some of the masses are as white as quicklime , and appear absolutely pure ; but on examining them with a lens , minute particles of scoriae can always be seen , and I could find none which , when dissolved in acids , did not leave a residue of this nature . It is , moreover , difficult to find a particle of the lime which does not change colour under the blowpipe , most of them even becoming glazed . The scoriaceous fragments and the calcareous matter are associated in the most irregular manner , sometimes in obscure beds , but more generally as a confused breccia , the lime in some parts and the scoriae in others being most abundant . Sir H. De la Beche has been so kind as to have some of the purest specimens analysed , with a view to discover , considering their volcanic origin , whether they contained much magnesia ; but only a small portion was found , such as is present in most limestones . Fragments of the scoriae embedded in the calcareous mass , when broken , exhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled with a white , delicate , excessively fragile , moss-like , or rather conferva-like , reticulation of carbonate of lime . These fibres , examined under a lens of one-tenth of an inch focal distance , appear cylindrical ; they are rather above one- thousandth of an inch in diameter ; they are either simply branched , or more commonly united into an irregular mass of network , with the meshes of very unequal sizes and of unequal numbers of sides . Some of the fibres are thickly covered with extremely minute spicula , occasionally aggregated into little tuffs ; and hence they have a hairy appearance . These spicula are of the same diameter throughout their length ; they are easily detached , so that the object-glass of the microscope soon becomes scattered over with them . Within the cells of many fragments of the scoria , the lime exhibits this fibrous structure , but generally in a less perfect degree . These cells do not appear to be connected with one another . There can be no doubt , as will presently be shown , that the lime was erupted , mingled with the lava in its fluid state , and therefore I have thought it worth while to describe minutely this curious fibrous structure , of which I know nothing analogous . From the earthy condition of the fibres , this structure does not appear to be related to crystallisation . Other fragments of the scoriaceous rock from this hill , when broken , are often seen marked with short and irregular white streaks , which are owing to a row of separate cells being partly , or quite , filled with white calcareous powder . This structure immediately reminded me of the appearance in badly kneaded dough , of balls and drawn-out streaks of flour , which have remained unmixed with the paste ; and I can not doubt that small masses of the lime , in the same manner remaining unmixed with the fluid lava , have been drawn out when the whole was in motion . I carefully examined , by trituration and solution in acids , pieces of the scoriae , taken from within half-an-inch of those cells which were filled with the calcareous powder , and they did not contain an atom of free lime . It is obvious that the lava and lime have on a large scale been very imperfectly mingled ; and where small portions of the lime have been entangled within a piece of the viscid lava , the cause of their now occupying , in the form of a powder or of a fibrous reticulation , the vesicular cavities , is , I think , evidently due to the confined gases having most readily expanded at the points where the incoherent lime rendered the lava less adhesive . A mile eastward of the town of Praya , there is a steep-sided gorge , about one hundred and fifty yards in width , cutting through the basaltic plain and underlying beds , but since filled up by a stream of more modern lava . This lava is dark grey , and in most parts compact and rudely columnar ; but at a little distance from the coast , it includes in an irregular manner a brecciated mass of red scoriae mingled with a considerable quantity of white , friable , and in some parts , nearly pure earthy lime , like that on the summit of Red Hill . This lava , with its entangled lime , has certainly flowed in the form of a regular stream ; and , judging from the shape of the gorge , towards which the drainage of the country ( feeble though it now be ) still is directed , and from the appearance of the bed of loose water-worn blocks with their interstices unfilled , like those in the bed of a torrent , on which the lava rests , we may conclude that the stream was of subaerial origin . I was unable to trace it to its source , but , from its direction , it seemed to have come from Signal Post Hill , distant one mile and a quarter , which , like Red Hill , has been a point of eruption subsequent to the elevation of the great basaltic plain . It accords with this view , that I found on Signal Post Hill , a mass of earthy , calcareous matter of the same nature , mingled with scoriae . I may here observe that part of the calcareous matter forming the horizontal sedimentary bed , especially the finer matter with which the embedded fragments of rock are whitewashed , has probably been derived from similar volcanic eruptions , as well as from triturated organic remains : the underlying , ancient , crystalline rocks , also , are associated with much carbonate of lime , filling amygdaloidal cavities , and forming irregular masses , the nature of which latter I was unable to understand . Considering the abundance of earthy lime near the summit of Red Hill , a volcanic cone six hundred feet in height , of subaerial growth , —considering the intimate manner in which minute particles and large masses of scoriae are embedded in the masses of nearly pure lime , and on the other hand , the manner in which small kernels and streaks of the calcareous powder are included in solid pieces of the scoriae , —considering , also , the similar occurrence of lime and scoriae within a stream of lava , also supposed , with good reason , to have been of modern subaerial origin , and to have flowed from a hill , where earthy lime also occurs : I think , considering these facts , there can be no doubt that the lime has been erupted , mingled with the molten lava . I am not aware that any similar case has been described : it appears to me an interesting one , inasmuch as most geologists must have speculated on the probable effects of a volcanic focus , bursting through deep-seated beds of different mineralogical composition . The great abundance of free silex in the trachytes of some countries ( as described by Beudant in Hungary , and by P. Scrope in the Panza Islands ) , perhaps solves the inquiry with respect to deep-seated beds of quartz ; and we probably here see it answered , where the volcanic action has invaded subjacent masses of limestone . One is naturally led to conjecture in what state the now earthy carbonate of lime existed , when ejected with the intensely heated lava : from the extreme cellularity of the scoriae on Red Hill , the pressure can not have been great , and as most volcanic eruptions are accompanied by the emission of large quantities of steam and other gases , we here have the most favourable conditions , according to the views at present entertained by chemists , for the expulsion of the carbonic acid . ( Whilst deep beneath the surface , the carbonate of lime was , I presume , in a fluid state . Hutton , it is known , thought that all amygdaloids were produced by drops of molten limestone floating in the trap , like oil in water : this no doubt is erroneous , but if the matter forming the summit of Red Hill had been cooled under the pressure of a moderately deep sea , or within the walls of a dike , we should , in all probability , have had a trap rock associated with large masses of compact , crystalline , calcareous spar , which , according to the views entertained by many geologists , would have been wrongly attributed to subsequent infiltration . ) Has the slow re- absorption of this gas , it may be asked , given to the lime in the cells of the lava , that peculiar fibrous structure , like that of an efflorescing salt ? Finally , I may remark on the great contrast in appearance between this earthy lime , which must have been heated in a free atmosphere of steam and other gases , while the white , crystalline , calcareous spar , produced by a single thin sheet of lava ( as at Quail Island ) rolling over similar earthy lime and the debris of organic remains , at the bottom of a shallow sea . SIGNAL POST HILL . This hill has already been several times mentioned , especially with reference to the remarkable manner in which the white calcareous stratum , in other parts so horizontal ( Figure 2 ) , dips under it into the sea . It has a broad summit , with obscure traces of a crateriform structure , and is composed of basaltic rocks ( Of these , one common variety is remarkable for being full of small fragments of a dark jasper-red earthy mineral , which , when examined carefully , shows an indistinct cleavage ; the little fragments are elongated in form , are soft , are magnetic before and after being heated , and fuse with difficulty into a dull enamel . This mineral is evidently closely related to the oxides of iron , but I can not ascertain what it exactly is . The rock containing this mineral is crenulated with small angular cavities , which are lined and filled with yellowish crystals of carbonate of lime . ) , some compact , others highly cellular with inclined beds of loose scoriae , of which some are associated with earthy lime . Like Red Hill , it has been the source of eruptions , subsequently to the elevation of the surrounding basaltic plain ; but unlike that hill , it has undergone considerable denudation , and has been the seat of volcanic action at a remote period , when beneath the sea . I judge of this latter circumstance from finding on its inland flank the last remains of three small points of eruption . These points are composed of glossy scoriae , cemented by crystalline calcareous spar , exactly like the great submarine calcareous deposit , where the heated lava has rolled over it : their demolished state can , I think , be explained only by the denuding action of the waves of the sea . I was guided to the first orifice by observing a sheet of lava , about two hundred yards square , with steepish sides , superimposed on the basaltic plain with no adjoining hillock , whence it could have been erupted ; and the only trace of a crater which I was able to discover , consisted of some inclined beds of scoriae at one of its corners . At the distance of fifty yards from a second level-topped patch of lava , but of much smaller size , I found an irregular circular group of masses of cemented , scoriaceous breccia , about six feet in height , which doubtless had once formed the point of eruption . The third orifice is now marked only by an irregular circle of cemented scoriae , about four yards in diameter , and rising in its highest point scarcely three feet above the level of the plain , the surface of which , close all round , exhibits its usual appearance : here we have a horizontal basal section of a volcanic spiracle , which , together with all its ejected matter , has been almost totally obliterated . The stream of lava , which fills the narrow gorge eastward of the town of Praya , judging from its course , seems , as before remarked , to have come from Signal Post Hill , and to have flowed over the plain , after its elevation ( The sides of this gorge , where the upper basaltic stratum is intersected , are almost perpendicular . The lava , which has since filled it up , is attached to these sides , almost as firmly as a dike is to its walls . In most cases , where a stream of lava has flowed down a valley , it is bounded on each side by loose scoriaceous masses . ) : the same observation applies to a stream ( possibly part of the same one ) capping the sea cliffs , a little eastward of the gorge . When I endeavoured to follow these streams over the stony level plain , which is almost destitute of soil and vegetation , I was much surprised to find , that although composed of hard basaltic matter , and not having been exposed to marine denudation , all distant traces of them soon became utterly lost . But I have since observed at the Galapagos Archipelago , that it is often impossible to follow even great deluges of quite recent lava across older streams , except by the size of the bushes growing on them , or by the comparative states of glossiness of their surfaces , —characters which a short lapse of time would be sufficient quite to obscure . I may remark , that in a level country , with a dry climate , and with the wind blowing always in one direction ( as at the Cape de Verde Archipelago ) , the effects of atmospheric degradation are probably much greater than would at first be expected ; for soil in this case accumulates only in a few protected hollows , and being blown in one direction , it is always travelling towards the sea in the form of the finest dust , leaving the surface of the rocks bare , and exposed to the full effects of renewed meteoric action . INLAND HILLS OF MORE ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS . These hills are laid down by eye , and marked as A , B , C , etc. , in Map 1 . They are related in mineralogical composition , and are probably directly continuous with the lowest rocks exposed on the coast . These hills , viewed from a distance , appear as if they had once formed part of an irregular tableland , and from their corresponding structure and composition this probably has been the case . They have flat , slightly inclined summits , and are , on an average , about six hundred feet in height ; they present their steepest slope towards the interior of the island , from which point they radiate outwards , and are separated from each other by broad and deep valleys , through which the great streams of lava , forming the coast-plains , have descended . Their inner and steeper escarpments are ranged in an irregular curve , which rudely follows the line of the shore , two or three miles inland from it . I ascended a few of these hills , and from others , which I was able to examine with a telescope , I obtained specimens , through the kindness of Mr. Kent , the assistant-surgeon of the “ Beagle ” ; although by these means I am acquainted with only a part of the range , five or six miles in length , yet I scarcely hesitate , from their uniform structure , to affirm that they are parts of one great formation , stretching round much of the circumference of the island . The upper and lower strata of these hills differ greatly in composition . The upper are basaltic , generally compact , but sometimes scoriaceous and amygdaloidal , with associated masses of wacke : where the basalt is compact , it is either fine-grained or very coarsely crystallised ; in the latter case it passes into an augitic rock , containing much olivine ; the olivine is either colourless , or of the usual yellow and dull reddish shades . On some of the hills , beds of calcareous matter , both in an earthy and in a crystalline form , including fragments of glossy scoriae , are associated with the basaltic strata . These strata differ from the streams of basaltic lava forming the coast-plains , only in being more compact , and in the crystals of augite , and in the grains of olivine being of much greater size ; —characters which , together with the appearance of the associated calcareous beds , induce me to believe that they are of submarine formation . Some considerable masses of wacke , which are associated with these basaltic strata , and which likewise occur in the basal series on the coast , especially at Quail Island , are curious . They consist of a pale yellowish- green argillaceous substance , of a crumbling texture when dry , but unctuous when moist : in its purest form , it is of a beautiful green tint , with translucent edges , and occasionally with obscure traces of an original cleavage . Under the blowpipe it fuses very readily into a dark grey , and sometimes even black bead , which is slightly magnetic . From these characters , I naturally thought that it was one of the pale species , decomposed , of the genus augite ; —a conclusion supported by the unaltered rock being full of large separate crystals of black augite , and of balls and irregular streaks of dark grey augitic rock . As the basalt ordinarily consists of augite , and of olivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour , I was led to examine the stages of decomposition of this latter mineral , and I found , to my surprise , that I could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered olivine to the green wacke . Part of the same grain under the blowpipe would in some instances behave like olivine , its colour being only slightly changed , and part would give a black magnetic bead . Hence I can have no doubt that the greenish wacke originally existed as olivine ; but great chemical changes must have been effected during the act of decomposition thus to have altered a very hard , transparent , infusible mineral , into a soft , unctuous , easily melted , argillaceous substance . ( D ’ Aubuisson “ Traite de Geognosie ” tome 2 page 569 mentions , on the authority of M. Marcel de Serres , masses of green earth near Montpellier , which are supposed to be due to the decomposition of olivine . I do not , however , find , that the action of this mineral under the blowpipe being entirely altered , as it becomes decomposed , has been noticed ; and the knowledge of this fact is important , as at first it appears highly improbable that a hard , transparent , refractory mineral should be changed into a soft , easily fused clay , like this of St. Jago . I shall hereafter describe a green substance , forming threads within the cells of some vesicular basaltic rocks in Van Diemen ’ s Land , which behave under the blowpipe like the green wacke of St. Jago ; but its occurrence in cylindrical threads , shows it can not have resulted from the decomposition of olivine , a mineral always existing in the form of grains or crystals . ) The basal strata of these hills , as well as some neighbouring , separate , bare , rounded hillocks , consist of compact , fine-grained , non-crystalline ( or so slightly as scarcely to be perceptible ) , ferruginous , feldspathic rocks , and generally in a state of semi-decomposition . Their fracture is exceedingly irregular , and splintery ; yet small fragments are often very tough . They contain much ferruginous matter , either in the form of minute grains with a metallic lustre , or of brown hair-like threads : the rock in this latter case assuming a pseudo-brecciated structure . These rocks sometimes contain mica and veins of agate . Their rusty brown or yellowish colour is partly due to the oxides of iron , but chiefly to innumerable , microscopically minute , black specks , which , when a fragment is heated , are easily fused , and evidently are either hornblende or augite . These rocks , therefore , although at first appearing like baked clay or some altered sedimentary deposit , contain all the essential ingredients of trachyte ; from which they differ only in not being harsh , and in not containing crystals of glassy feldspar . As is so often the case with trachytic formation , no stratification is here apparent . A person would not readily believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava ; yet at St. Helena there are well-characterised streams ( as will be described in an ensuing chapter ) of nearly similar composition . Amidst the hillocks composed of these rocks , I found in three places , smooth conical hills of phonolite , abounding with fine crystals of glassy feldspar , and with needles of hornblende . These cones of phonolite , I believe , bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic strata which some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock , in another part of the island , bear to the surrounding basalt , namely , that both have been injected . The rocks of a feldspathic nature being anterior in origin to the basaltic strata , which cap them , as well as to the basaltic streams of the coast-plains , accords with the usual order of succession of these two grand divisions of the volcanic series . The strata of most of these hills in the upper part , where alone the planes of division are distinguishable , are inclined at a small angle from the interior of the island towards the sea-coast . The inclination is not the same in each hill ; in that marked A it is less than in B , D , or E ; in C the strata are scarcely deflected from a horizontal plane , and in F ( as far as I could judge without ascending it ) they are slightly inclined in a reverse direction , that is , inwards and towards the centre of the island . Notwithstanding these differences of inclination , their correspondence in external form , and in the composition both of their upper and lower parts , - -their relative position in one curved line , with their steepest sides turned inwards , —all seem to show that they originally formed parts of one platform ; which platform , as before remarked , probably extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of the island . The upper strata certainly flowed as lava , and probably beneath the sea , as perhaps did the lower feldspathic masses : how then come these strata to hold their present position , and whence were they erupted ? In the centre of the island there are lofty mountains , but they are separated from the steep inland flanks of these hills by a wide space of lower country : the interior mountains , moreover , seem to have been the source of those great streams of basaltic lava which , contracting as they pass between the bases of the hills in question , expand into the coast- plains . ( I saw very little of the inland parts of the island . Near the village of St. Domingo , there are magnificent cliffs of rather coarsely crystallised basaltic lava . Following the little stream in this valley , about a mile above the village , the base of the great cliff was formed of a compact fine-grained basalt , conformably covered by a bed of pebbles . Near Fuentes , I met with pap-formed hills of the compact feldspathic series of rocks . ) Round the shores of St. Helena there is a rudely formed ring of basaltic rocks , and at Mauritius there are remnants of another such a ring round part , if not round the whole , of the island ; here again the same question immediately occurs , how came these masses to hold their present position , and whence were they erupted ? The same answer , whatever it may be , probably applies in these three cases ; and in a future chapter we shall recur to this subject . VALLEYS NEAR THE COAST . These are broad , very flat , and generally bounded by low cliff-formed sides . Portions of the basaltic plain are sometimes nearly or quite isolated by them ; of which fact , the space on which the town of Praya stands offers an instance . The great valley west of the town has its bottom filled up to a depth of more than twenty feet by well-rounded pebbles , which in some parts are firmly cemented together by white calcareous matter . There can be no doubt , from the form of these valleys , that they were scooped out by the waves of the sea , during that equable elevation of the land , of which the horizontal calcareous deposit , with its existing species of marine remains , gives evidence . Considering how well shells have been preserved in this stratum , it is singular that I could not find even a single small fragment of shell in the conglomerate at the bottom of the valleys . The bed of pebbles in the valley west of the town is intersected by a second valley joining it as a tributary , but even this valley appears much too wide and flat-bottomed to have been formed by the small quantity of water , which falls only during one short wet season ; for at other times of the year these valleys are absolutely dry . RECENT CONGLOMERATE . On the shores of Quail Island , I found fragments of brick , bolts of iron , pebbles , and large fragments of basalt , united by a scanty base of impure calcareous matter into a firm conglomerate . To show how exceedingly firm this recent conglomerate is , I may mention , that I endeavoured with a heavy geological hammer to knock out a thick bolt of iron , which was embedded a little above low-water mark , but was quite unable to succeed .

During our short visit at this and the four following islands , I observed very little worthy of description . Fernando Noronha is situated in the Atlantic Ocean , in latitude 3 degrees 50 minutes S. , and 230 miles distant from the coast of South America . It consists of several islets , together nine miles in length by three in breadth . The whole seems to be of volcanic origin ; although there is no appearance of any crater , or of any one central eminence . The most remarkable feature is a hill 1,000 feet high , of which the upper 400 feet consist of a precipitous , singularly shaped pinnacle , formed of columnar phonolite , containing numerous crystals of glassy feldspar , and a few needles of hornblende . From the highest accessible point of this hill , I could distinguish in different parts of the group several other conical hills , apparently of the same nature . At St. Helena there are similar , great , conical , protuberant masses of phonolite , nearly one thousand feet in height , which have been formed by the injection of fluid feldspathic lava into yielding strata . If this hill has had , as is probable , a similar origin , denudation has been here effected on an enormous scale . Near the base of this hill , I observed beds of white tuff , intersected by numerous dikes , some of amygdaloidal basalt and others of trachyte ; and beds of slaty phonolite with the planes of cleavage directed N.W . and S.E . Parts of this rock , where the crystals were scanty , closely resembled common clay-slate , altered by the contact of a trap-dike . The lamination of rocks , which undoubtedly have once been fluid , appears to me a subject well deserving attention . On the beach there were numerous fragments of compact basalt , of which rock a distant facade of columns seemed to be formed . TERCEIRA IN THE AZORES . The central parts of this island consist of irregularly rounded mountains of no great elevation , composed of trachyte , which closely resembles in general character the trachyte of Ascension , presently to be described . This formation is in many parts overlaid , in the usual order of superposition , by streams of basaltic lava , which near the coast compose nearly the whole surface . The course which these streams have followed from their craters , can often be followed by the eye . The town of Angra is overlooked by a crateriform hill ( Mount Brazil ) , entirely built of thin strata of fine-grained , harsh , brown-coloured tuff . The upper beds are seen to overlap the basaltic streams on which the town stands . This hill is almost identical in structure and composition with numerous crateriformed hills in the Galapagos Archipelago . EFFECTS OF STEAM ON THE TRACHYTIC ROCKS . In the central part of the island there is a spot , where steam is constantly issuing in jets from the bottom of a small ravine-like hollow , which has no exit , and which abuts against a range of trachytic mountains . The steam is emitted from several irregular fissures : it is scentless , soon blackens iron , and is of much too high temperature to be endured by the hand . The manner in which the solid trachyte is changed on the borders of these orifices is curious : first , the base becomes earthy , with red freckles evidently due to the oxidation of particles of iron ; then it becomes soft ; and lastly , even the crystals of glassy feldspar yield to the dissolving agent . After the mass is converted into clay , the oxide of iron seems to be entirely removed from some parts , which are left perfectly white , whilst in other neighbouring parts , which are of the brightest red colour , it seems to be deposited in greater quantity ; some other masses are marbled with two distinct colours . Portions of the white clay , now that they are dry , can not be distinguished by the eye from the finest prepared chalk ; and when placed between the teeth they feel equally soft-grained ; the inhabitants use this substance for white-washing their houses . The cause of the iron being dissolved in one part , and close by being again deposited , is obscure ; but the fact has been observed in several other places . ( Spallanzani , Dolomieu , and Hoffman have described similar cases in the Italian volcanic islands . Dolomieu says the iron at the Panza Islands is redeposited in the form of veins ( page 86 “ Memoire sur les Isles Ponces ” ) . These authors likewise believe that the steam deposits silica : it is now experimentally known that vapour of a high temperature is able to dissolve silica . ) In some half-decayed specimens , I found small , globular aggregations of yellow hyalite , resembling gum-arabic , which no doubt had been deposited by the steam . As there is no escape for the rain-water , which trickles down the sides of the ravine-like hollow , whence the steam issues , it must all percolate downwards through the fissures at its bottom . Some of the inhabitants informed me that it was on record that flames ( some luminous appearance ? ) had originally proceeded from these cracks , and that the flames had been succeeded by the steam ; but I was not able to ascertain how long this was ago , or anything certain on the subject . When viewing the spot , I imagined that the injection of a large mass of rock . like the cone of phonolite at Fernando Noronha , in a semi-fluid state , by arching the surface might have caused a wedge-shaped hollow with cracks at the bottom , and that the rain- water percolating to the neighbourhood of the heated mass , would during many succeeding years be driven back in the form of steam . TAHITI ( OTAHEITE ) . I visited only a part of the north-western side of this island , and this part is entirely composed of volcanic rocks . Near the coast there are several varieties of basalt , some abounding with large crystals of augite and tarnished olivine , others compact and earthy , —some slightly vesicular , and others occasionally amygdaloidal . These rocks are generally much decomposed , and to my surprise , I found in several sections that it was impossible to distinguish , even approximately , the line of separation between the decayed lava and the alternating beds of tuff . Since the specimens have become dry , it is rather more easy to distinguish the decomposed igneous rocks from the sedimentary tuffs . This gradation in character between rocks having such widely different origins , may I think be explained by the yielding under pressure of the softened sides of the vesicular cavities , which in many volcanic rocks occupy a large proportion of their bulk . As the vesicles generally increase in size and number in the upper parts of a stream of lava , so would the effects of their compression increase ; the yielding , moreover , of each lower vesicle must tend to disturb all the softened matter above it . Hence we might expect to trace a perfect gradation from an unaltered crystalline rock to one in which all the particles ( although originally forming part of the same solid mass ) had undergone mechanical displacement ; and such particles could hardly be distinguished from others of similar composition , which had been deposited as sediment . As lavas are sometimes laminated in their upper parts even horizontal lines , appearing like those of aqueous deposition , could not in all cases be relied on as a criterion of sedimentary origin . From these considerations it is not surprising that formerly many geologists believed in real transitions from aqueous deposits , through wacke , into igneous traps . In the valley of Tia-auru , the commonest rocks are basalts with much olivine , and in some cases almost composed of large crystals of augite . I picked up some specimens , with much glassy feldspar , approaching in character to trachyte . There were also many large blocks of vesicular basalt , with the cavities beautifully lined with chabasie ( ? ) , and radiating bundles of mesotype . Some of these specimens presented a curious appearance , owing to a number of the vesicles being half filled up with a white , soft , earthy mesotypic mineral , which intumesced under the blowpipe in a remarkable manner . As the upper surfaces in all the half-filled cells are exactly parallel , it is evident that this substance has sunk to the bottom of each cell from its weight . Sometimes , however , it entirely fills the cells . Other cells are either quite filled , or lined , with small crystals , apparently of chabasie ; these crystals , also , frequently line the upper half of the cells partly filled with the earthy mineral , as well as the upper surface of this substance itself , in which case the two minerals appear to blend into each other . I have never seen any other amygdaloid with the cells half filled in the manner here described ; and it is difficult to imagine the causes which determined the earthy mineral to sink from its gravity to the bottom of the cells , and the crystalline mineral to adhere in a coating of equal thickness round the sides of the cells . ( MacCulloch , however , has described and given a plate of ( “ Geolog . Trans. ” 1st series volume 4 page 225 ) a trap rock , with cavities filled up horizontally with quartz and chalcedony . The upper halves of these cavities are often filled by layers , which follow each irregularity of the surface , and by little depending stalactites of the same siliceous substances . ) The basic strata on the sides of the valley are gently inclined seaward , and I nowhere observed any sign of disturbance ; the strata are separated from each other by thick , compact beds of conglomerate , in which the fragments are large , some being rounded , but most angular . From the character of these beds , from the compact and crystalline condition of most of the lavas , and from the nature of the infiltrated minerals , I was led to conjecture that they had originally flowed beneath the sea . This conclusion agrees with the fact that the Rev . W. Ellis found marine remains at a considerable height , which he believes were interstratified with volcanic matter ; as is likewise described to be the case by Messrs. Tyerman and Bennett at Huaheine , an island in this same archipelago . Mr. Stutchbury also discovered near the summit of one of the loftiest mountains of Tahiti , at the height of several thousand feet , a stratum of semi-fossil coral . None of these remains have been specifically examined . On the coast , where masses of coral-rock would have afforded the clearest evidence , I looked in vain for any signs of recent elevation . For references to the above authorities , and for more detailed reasons for not believing that Tahiti has been recently elevated , I must refer to the “ Structure and Distribution of Coral-Reefs. ” MAURITIUS . Approaching this island on the northern or north-western side , a curved chain of bold mountains , surmounted by rugged pinnacles , is seen to rise from a smooth border of cultivated land , which gently slopes down to the coast . At the first glance , one is tempted to believe that the sea lately reached the base of these mountains , and upon examination , this view , at least with respect to the inferior parts of the border , is found to be perfectly correct . Several authors have described masses of upraised coral- rock round the greater part of the circumference of the island . ( Captain Carmichael , in Hooker ’ s “ Bot . Misc. ” volume 2 page 301 . Captain Lloyd has lately , in the “ Proceedings of the Geological Society ” ( volume 3 page 317 ) , described carefully some of these masses . In the “ Voyage a l ’ Isle de France , par un Officier du Roi , ” many interesting facts are given on this subject . Consult also “ Voyage aux Quatre Isles d ’ Afrique , par M. Bory St. Vincent. ” ) Between Tamarin Bay and the Great Black River I observed , in company with Captain Lloyd , two hillocks of coral-rock , formed in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone , and in their upper of great blocks , slightly aggregated , of Astraea and Madrepora , and of fragments of basalt ; they were divided into beds dipping seaward , in one case at an angle of 8 degrees , and in the other at 18 degrees ; they had a water-worn appearance , and they rose abruptly from a smooth surface , strewed with rolled debris of organic remains , to a height of about twenty feet . The Officier du Roi , in his most interesting tour in 1768 round the island , has described masses of upraised coral-rocks , still retaining that moat-like structure ( see my “ Coral Reefs ” ) which is characteristic of the living reefs . On the coast northward of Port Louis , I found the lava concealed for a considerable space inland by a conglomerate of corals and shells , like those on the beach , but in parts consolidated by red ferruginous matter . M. Bory St. Vincent has described similar calcareous beds over nearly the whole of the plain of Pamplemousses . Near Port Louis , when turning over some large stones , which lay in the bed of a stream at the head of a protected creek , and at the height of some yards above the level of spring tides , I found several shells of serpula still adhering to their under sides . The jagged mountains near Port Louis rise to a height of between two and three thousand feet ; they consist of strata of basalt , obscurely separated from each other by firmly aggregated beds of fragmentary matter ; and they are intersected by a few vertical dikes . The basalt in some parts abounds with large crystals of augite and olivine , and is generally compact . The interior of the island forms a plain , raised probably about a thousand feet above the level of the sea , and composed of streams of lava which have flowed round and between the rugged basaltic mountains . These more recent lavas are also basaltic , but less compact , and some of them abound with feldspar , so that they even fuse into a pale coloured glass . On the banks of the Great River , a section is exposed nearly five hundred feet deep , worn through numerous thin sheets of the lava of this series , which are separated from each other by beds of scoriae . They seem to have been of subaerial formation , and to have flowed from several points of eruption on the central platform , of which the Piton du Milieu is said to be the principal one . There are also several volcanic cones , apparently of this modern period , round the circumference of the island , especially at the northern end , where they form separate islets . The mountains composed of the more compact and crystalline basalt , form the main skeleton of the island . M. Bailly ( “ Voyage aux Terres Australes ” tome 1 page 54 . ) states that they all “ se developpent autour d ’ elle comme une ceinture d ’ immenses remparts , toutes affectant une pente plus ou moins enclinee vers le rivage de la mer ; tandis , au contraire , que vers le centre de l ’ ile elles presentent une coupe abrupte , et souvent taillee a pic . Toutes ces montagnes sont formees de couches paralleles inclinees du centre de l ’ ile vers la mer. ” These statements have been disputed , though not in detail , by M. Quoy , in the voyage of Freycinet . As far as my limited means of observation went , I found them perfectly correct . ( M. Lesson , in his account of this island , in the “ Voyage of the ‘ Coquille ’ , ” seems to follow M. Bailly ’ s views . ) The mountains on the N.W . side of the island , which I examined , namely , La Pouce , Peter Botts , Corps de Garde , Les Mamelles , and apparently another farther southward , have precisely the external shape and stratification described by M. Bailly . They form about a quarter of his girdle of ramparts . Although these mountains now stand quite detached , being separated from each other by breaches , even several miles in width , through which deluges of lava have flowed from the interior of the island ; nevertheless , seeing their close general similarity , one must feel convinced that they originally formed parts of one continuous mass . Judging from the beautiful map of the Mauritius , published by the Admiralty from a French MS. , there is a range of mountains ( M. Bamboo ) on the opposite side of the island , which correspond in height , relative position , and external form , with those just described . Whether the girdle was ever complete may well be doubted ; but from M. Bailly ’ s statements , and my own observations , it may be safely concluded that mountains with precipitous inland flanks , and composed of strata dipping outwards , once extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of the island . The ring appears to have been oval and of vast size ; its shorter axis , measured across from the inner sides of the mountains near Port Louis and those near Grand Port , being no less than thirteen geographical miles in length . M. Bailly boldly supposes that this enormous gulf , which has since been filled up to a great extent by streams of modern lava , was formed by the sinking in of the whole upper part of one great volcano . It is singular in how many respects those portions of St. Jago and of Mauritius which I visited agree in their geological history . At both islands , mountains of similar external form , stratification , and ( at least in their upper beds ) composition , follow in a curved chain the coast-line . These mountains in each case appear originally to have formed parts of one continuous mass . The basaltic strata of which they are composed , from their compact and crystalline structure , seem , when contrasted with the neighbouring basaltic streams of subaerial formation , to have flowed beneath the pressure of the sea , and to have been subsequently elevated . We may suppose that the wide breaches between the mountains were in both cases worn by the waves , during their gradual elevation—of which process , within recent times , there is abundant evidence on the coast-land of both islands . At both , vast streams of more recent basaltic lavas have flowed from the interior of the island , round and between the ancient basaltic hills ; at both , moreover , recent cones of eruption are scattered around the circumference of the island ; but at neither have eruptions taken place within the period of history . As remarked in the last chapter , it is probable that these ancient basaltic mountains , which resemble ( at least in many respects ) the basal and disturbed remnants of two gigantic volcanoes , owe their present form , structure , and position , to the action of similar causes . ST. PAUL ’ S ROCKS . This small island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean , nearly one degree north of the equator , and 540 miles distant from South America , in 29 degrees 15 minutes west longitude . Its highest point is scarcely fifty feet above the level of the sea ; its outline is irregular , and its entire circumference barely three-quarters of a mile . This little point of rock rises abruptly out of the ocean ; and , except on its western side , soundings were not obtained , even at the short distance of a quarter of a mile from its shore . It is not of volcanic origin ; and this circumstance , which is the most remarkable point in its history ( as will hereafter be referred to ) , properly ought to exclude it from the present volume . It is composed of rocks , unlike any which I have met with , and which I can not characterise by any name , and must therefore describe . The simplest , and one of the most abundant kinds , is a very compact , heavy , greenish-black rock , having an angular , irregular fracture , with some points just hard enough to scratch glass , and infusible . This variety passes into others of paler green tints , less hard , but with a more crystalline fracture , and translucent on their edges ; and these are fusible into a green enamel . Several other varieties are chiefly characterised by containing innumerable threads of dark-green serpentine , and by having calcareous matter in their interstices . These rocks have an obscure , concretionary structure , and are full of variously coloured angular pseudo fragments . These angular pseudo fragments consist of the first-described dark green rock , of a brown softer kind , of serpentine , and of a yellowish harsh stone , which , perhaps , is related to serpentine rock . There are other vesicular , calcareo-ferruginous , soft stones . There is no distinct stratification , but parts are imperfectly laminated ; and the whole abounds with innumerable veins , and vein-like masses , both small and large . Of these vein-like masses , some calcareous ones , which contain minute fragments of shells , are clearly of subsequent origin to the others . A GLOSSY INCRUSTATION . Extensive portions of these rocks are coated by a layer of a glossy polished substance , with a pearly lustre and of a greyish white colour ; it follows all the inequalities of the surface , to which it is firmly attached . When examined with a lens , it is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers , their aggregate thickness being about the tenth of an inch . It is considerably harder than calcareous spar , but can be scratched with a knife ; under the blowpipe it scales off , decrepitates , slightly blackens , emits a fetid odour , and becomes strongly alkaline : it does not effervesce in acids . ( In my “ Journal ” I have described this substance ; I then believed that it was an impure phosphate of lime . ) I presume this substance has been deposited by water draining from the birds ’ dung , with which the rocks are covered . At Ascension , near a cavity in the rocks which was filled with a laminated mass of infiltrated birds ’ dung , I found some irregularly formed , stalactitical masses of apparently the same nature . These masses , when broken , had an earthy texture ; but on their outsides , and especially at their extremities , they were formed of a pearly substance , generally in little globules , like the enamel of teeth , but more translucent , and so hard as just to scratch plate-glass . This substance slightly blackens under the blowpipe , emits a bad smell , then becomes quite white , swelling a little , and fuses into a dull white enamel ; it does not become alkaline ; nor does it effervesce in acids . The whole mass had a collapsed appearance , as if in the formation of the hard glossy crust the whole had shrunk much . At the Abrolhos Islands on the coast of Brazil , where also there is much birds ’ dung , I found a great quantity of a brown , arborescent substance adhering to some trap-rock . In its arborescent form , this substance singularly resembles some of the branched species of Nullipora . Under the blowpipe , it behaves like the specimens from Ascension ; but it is less hard and glossy , and the surface has not the shrunk appearance . CHAPTER III . ASCENSION . Basaltic lavas .

( MAP 2 : THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION . ) This island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean , in latitude 8 degrees S. , longitude 14 degrees W. It has the form of an irregular triangle ( see Map 2 ) , each side being about six miles in length . Its highest point is 2,870 feet ( “ Geographical Journal ” volume 5 page 243 . ) above the level of the sea . The whole is volcanic , and , from the absence of proofs to the contrary , I believe of subaerial origin . The fundamental rock is everywhere of a pale colour , generally compact , and of a feldspathic nature . In the S.E . portion of the island , where the highest land is situated , well characterised trachyte , and other congenerous rocks of that varying family , occur . Nearly the entire circumference is covered up by black and rugged streams of basaltic lava , with here and there a hill or single point of rock ( one of which near the sea-coast , north of the Fort , is only two or three yards across ) of the trachyte still remaining exposed . BASALTIC ROCKS . The overlying basaltic lava is in some parts extremely vesicular , in others little so ; it is of a black colour , but sometimes contains crystals of glassy feldspar , and seldom much olivine . These streams appear to have possessed singularly little fluidity ; their side walls and lower ends being very steep , and even as much as between twenty and thirty feet in height . Their surface is extraordinarily rugged , and from a short distance appears as if studded with small craters . These projections consist of broad , irregularly conical , hillocks , traversed by fissures , and composed of the same unequally scoriaceous basalt with the surrounding streams , but having an obscure tendency to a columnar structure ; they rise to a height between ten and thirty feet above the general surface , and have been formed , as I presume , by the heaping up of the viscid lava at points of greater resistance . At the base of several of these hillocks , and occasionally likewise on more level parts , solid ribs , composed of angulo-globular masses of basalt , resembling in size and outline arched sewers or gutters of brickwork , but not being hollow , project between two or three feet above the surface of the streams ; what their origin may have been , I do not know . Many of the superficial fragments from these basaltic streams present singularly convoluted forms ; and some specimens could hardly be distinguished from logs of dark-coloured wood without their bark . Many of the basaltic streams can be traced , either to points of eruption at the base of the great central mass of trachyte , or to separate , conical , red-coloured hills , which are scattered over the northern and western borders of the island . Standing on the central eminence , I counted between twenty and thirty of these cones of eruption . The greater number of them had their truncated summits cut off obliquely , and they all sloped towards the S.E. , whence the trade-wind blows . ( M. Lesson in the “ Zoology of the Voyage of the ‘ Coquille ’ ” page 490 has observed this fact . Mr. Hennah ( “ Geolog . Proceedings ” 1835 page 189 ) further remarks that the most extensive beds of ashes at Ascension invariably occur on the leeward side of the island . ) This structure no doubt has been caused by the ejected fragments and ashes being always blown , during eruptions , in greater quantity towards one side than towards the other . M. Moreau de Jonnes has made a similar observation with respect to the volcanic orifices in the West Indian Islands . VOLCANIC BOMBS . ( FIGURE 3 : FRAGMENT OF A SPHERICAL VOLCANIC BOMB , with the interior parts coarsely cellular , coated by a concentric layer of compact lava , and this again by a crust of finely cellular rock . FIGURE 4 : VOLCANIC BOMB OF OBSIDIAN FROM AUSTRALIA . The upper figure gives a front view ; the lower a side view of the same object . ) These occur in great numbers strewed on the ground , and some of them lie at considerable distances from any points of eruption . They vary in size from that of an apple to that of a man ’ s body ; they are either spherical or pear-shaped , or with the hinder part ( corresponding to the tail of a comet ) irregular , studded with projecting points , and even concave . Their surfaces are rough , and fissured with branching cracks ; their internal structure is either irregularly scoriaceous and compact , or it presents a symmetrical and very curious appearance . An irregular segment of a bomb of this latter kind , of which I found several , is accurately represented in Figure 3 . Its size was about that of a man ’ s head . The whole interior is coarsely cellular ; the cells averaging in diameter about the tenth of an inch ; but nearer the outside they gradually decrease in size . This part is succeeded by a well-defined shell of compact lava , having a nearly uniform thickness of about the third of an inch ; and the shell is overlaid by a somewhat thicker coating of finely cellular lava ( the cells varying from the fiftieth to the hundredth of an inch in diameter ) , which forms the external surface : the line separating the shell of compact lava from the outer scoriaceous crust is distinctly defined . This structure is very simply explained , if we suppose a mass of viscid , scoriaceous matter , to be projected with a rapid , rotatory motion through the air ; for whilst the external crust , from cooling , became solidified ( in the state we now see it ) , the centrifugal force , by relieving the pressure in the interior parts of the bomb , would allow the heated vapours to expand their cells ; but these being driven by the same force against the already-hardened crust , would become , the nearer they were to this part , smaller and smaller or less expanded , until they became packed into a solid , concentric shell . As we know that chips from a grindstone ( Nichol “ Architecture of the Heavens. ” ) can be flirted off , when made to revolve with sufficient velocity , we need not doubt that the centrifugal force would have power to modify the structure of a softened bomb , in the manner here supposed . Geologists have remarked , that the external form of a bomb at once bespeaks the history of its aerial course , and few now see that the internal structure can speak , with almost equal plainness , of its rotatory movement . M. Bory St. Vincent ( “ Voyage aux Quatre Isles d ’ Afrique ” tome 1 page 222 . ) has described some balls of lava from the Isle of Bourbon , which have a closely similar structure . His explanation , however ( if I understand it rightly ) , is very different from that which I have given ; for he supposes that they have rolled , like snowballs , down the sides of the crater . M. Beudant ( “ Voyage en Hongrie ” tome 2 page 214 . ) , also , has described some singular little balls of obsidian , never more than six or eight inches in diameter , which he found strewed on the surface of the ground : their form is always oval ; sometimes they are much swollen in the middle , and even spindle-shaped : their surface is regularly marked with concentric ridges and furrows , all of which on the same ball are at right angles to one axis : their interior is compact and glassy . M. Beudant supposes that masses of lava , when soft , were shot into the air , with a rotatory movement round the same axis , and that the form and superficial ridges of the bombs were thus produced . Sir Thomas Mitchell has given me what at first appears to be the half of a much flattened oval ball of obsidian ; it has a singular artificial-like appearance , which is well represented ( of the natural size ) in Figure 4 . It was found in its present state , on a great sandy plain between the rivers Darling and Murray , in Australia , and at the distance of several hundred miles from any known volcanic region . It seems to have been embedded in some reddish tufaceous matter ; and may have been transported either by the aborigines or by natural means . The external saucer consists of compact obsidian , of a bottle-green colour , and is filled with finely cellular black lava , much less transparent and glassy than the obsidian . The external surface is marked with four or five not quite perfect ridges , which are represented rather too distinctly in Figure 4 . Here , then , we have the external structure described by M. Beudant , and the internal cellular condition of the bombs from Ascension . The lip of the saucer is slightly concave , exactly like the margin of a soup-plate , and its inner edge overlaps a little the central cellular lava . This structure is so symmetrical round the entire circumference , that one is forced to suppose that the bomb burst during its rotatory course , before being quite solidified , and that the lip and edges were thus slightly modified and turned inwards . It may be remarked that the superficial ridges are in planes , at right angles to an axis , transverse to the longer axis of the flattened oval : to explain this circumstance , we may suppose that when the bomb burst , the axis of rotation changed . AERIFORM EXPLOSIONS . The flanks of Green Mountain and the surrounding country are covered by a great mass , some hundred feet in thickness , of loose fragments . The lower beds generally consist of fine-grained , slightly consolidated tuffs ( Some of this peperino , or tuff , is sufficiently hard not to be broken by the greatest force of the fingers . ) , and the upper beds of great loose fragments , with alternating finer beds . ( On the northern side of the Green Mountain a thin seam , about an inch in thickness , of compact oxide of iron , extends over a considerable area ; it lies conformably in the lower part of the stratified mass of ashes and fragments . This substance is of a reddish- brown colour , with an almost metallic lustre ; it is not magnetic , but becomes so after having been heated under the blowpipe , by which it is blackened and partly fused . This seam of compact stone , by intercepting the little rain-water which falls on the island , gives rise to a small dripping spring , first discovered by Dampier . It is the only fresh water on the island , so that the possibility of its being inhabited has entirely depended on the occurrence of this ferruginous layer . ) One white ribbon- like layer of decomposed , pumiceous breccia , was curiously bent into deep unbroken curves , beneath each of the large fragments in the superincumbent stratum . From the relative position of these beds , I presume that a narrow- mouthed crater , standing nearly in the position of Green Mountain , like a great air-gun , shot forth , before its final extinction , this vast accumulation of loose matter . Subsequently to this event , considerable dislocations have taken place , and an oval circus has been formed by subsidence . This sunken space lies at the north-eastern foot of Green Mountain , and is well represented in Map 2 . Its longer axis , which is connected with a N.E . and S.W . line of fissure , is three-fifths of a nautical mile in length ; its sides are nearly perpendicular , except in one spot , and about four hundred feet in height ; they consist , in the lower part , of a pale basalt with feldspar , and in the upper part , of the tuff and loose ejected fragments ; the bottom is smooth and level , and under almost any other climate a deep lake would have been formed here . From the thickness of the bed of loose fragments , with which the surrounding country is covered , the amount of aeriform matter necessary for their projection must have been enormous ; hence we may suppose it probable that after the explosions vast subterranean caverns were left , and that the falling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here described . At the Galapagos Archipelago , pits of a similar character , but of a much smaller size , frequently occur at the bases of small cones of eruption . EJECTED GRANITIC FRAGMENTS . In the neighbourhood of Green Mountain , fragments of extraneous rock are not unfrequently found embedded in the midst of masses of scoriae . Lieutenant Evans , to whose kindness I am indebted for much information , gave me several specimens , and I found others myself . They nearly all have a granitic structure , are brittle , harsh to the touch , and apparently of altered colours . FIRST , a white syenite , streaked and mottled with red ; it consists of well- crystallised feldspar , numerous grains of quartz , and brilliant , though small , crystals of hornblende . The feldspar and hornblende in this and the succeeding cases have been determined by the reflecting goniometer , and the quartz by its action under the blowpipe . The feldspar in these ejected fragments , like the glassy kind in the trachyte , is from its cleavage a potash-feldspar . SECONDLY , a brick-red mass of feldspar , quartz , and small dark patches of a decayed mineral ; one minute particle of which I was able to ascertain , by its cleavage , to be hornblende . THIRDLY , a mass of confusedly crystallised white feldspar , with little nests of a dark-coloured mineral , often carious , externally rounded , having a glossy fracture , but no distinct cleavage : from comparison with the second specimen , I have no doubt that it is fused hornblende . FOURTHLY , a rock , which at first appears a simple aggregation of distinct and large-sized crystals of dusty-coloured Labrador feldspar ( Professor Miller has been so kind as to examine this mineral . He obtained two good cleavages of 86 degrees 30 minutes and 86 degrees 50 minutes . The mean of several , which I made , was 86 degrees 30 minutes . Professor Miller states that these crystals , when reduced to a fine powder , are soluble in hydrochloric acid , leaving some undissolved silex behind ; the addition of oxalate of ammonia gives a copious precipitate of lime . He further remarks , that according to Von Kobell , anorthite ( a mineral occurring in the ejected fragments at Mount Somma ) is always white and transparent , so that if this be the case , these crystals from Ascension must be considered as Labrador feldspar . Professor Miller adds , that he has seen an account , in Erdmann ’ s “ Journal fur tecnische Chemie , ” of a mineral ejected from a volcano which had the external characters of Labrador feldspar , but differed in the analysis from that given by mineralogists of this mineral : the author attributed this difference to an error in the analysis of Labrador feldspar , which is very old . ) ; but in their interstices there is some white granular feldspar , abundant scales of mica , a little altered hornblende , and , as I believe , no quartz . I have described these fragments in detail , because it is rare to find granitic rocks ejected from volcanoes with their MINERALS UNCHANGED , as is the case with the first specimen , and partially with the second . ( Daubeny , in his work on Volcanoes page 386 , remarks that this is the case ; and Humboldt , in his “ Personal Narrative ” volume 1 page 236 , says “ In general , the masses of known primitive rocks , I mean those which perfectly resemble our granites , gneiss , and mica-slate , are very rare in lavas : the substances we generally denote by the name of granite , thrown out by Vesuvius , are mixtures of nepheline , mica , and pyroxene. ” ) One other large fragment , found in another spot , is deserving of notice ; it is a conglomerate , containing small fragments of granitic , cellular , and jaspery rocks , and of hornstone porphyries , embedded in a base of wacke , threaded by numerous thin layers of a concretionary pitchstone passing into obsidian . These layers are parallel , slightly tortuous , and short ; they thin out at their ends , and resemble in form the layers of quartz in gneiss . It is probable that these small embedded fragments were not separately ejected , but were entangled in a fluid volcanic rock , allied to obsidian ; and we shall presently see that several varieties of this latter series of rock assume a laminated structure . TRACHYTIC SERIES OF ROCKS . Those occupy the more elevated and central , and likewise the south-eastern , parts of the island . The trachyte is generally of a pale brown colour , stained with small darker patches ; it contains broken and bent crystals of glassy feldspar , grains of specular iron , and black microscopical points , which latter , from being easily fused , and then becoming magnetic , I presume are hornblende . The greater number of the hills , however , are composed of a quite white , friable stone , appearing like a trachytic tuff . Obsidian , hornstone , and several kinds of laminated feldspathic rocks , are associated with the trachyte . There is no distinct stratification ; nor could I distinguish a crateriform structure in any of the hills of this series . Considerable dislocations have taken place ; and many fissures in these rocks are yet left open , or are only partially filled with loose fragments . Within the space ( This space is nearly included by a line sweeping round Green Mountain , and joining the hills , called the Weather Port Signal , Holyhead , and that denominated ( improperly in a geological sense ) “ the Crater of an old volcano. ” ) , mainly formed of trachyte , some basaltic streams have burst forth ; and not far from the summit of Green Mountain , there is one stream of quite black , vesicular basalt , containing minute crystals of glassy feldspar , which have a rounded appearance . The soft white stone above mentioned is remarkable from its singular resemblance , when viewed in mass , to a sedimentary tuff : it was long before I could persuade myself that such was not its origin ; and other geologists have been perplexed by closely similar formations in trachytic regions . In two cases , this white earthy stone formed isolated hills ; in a third , it was associated with columnar and laminated trachyte ; but I was unable to trace an actual junction . It contains numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and black microscopical specks , and is marked with small darker patches , exactly as in the surrounding trachyte . Its basis , however , when viewed under the microscope , is generally quite earthy ; but sometimes it exhibits a decidedly crystalline structure . On the hill marked “ Crater of an old volcano , ” it passes into a pale greenish-grey variety , differing only in its colour , and in not being so earthy ; the passage was in one case effected insensibly ; in another , it was formed by numerous , rounded and angular , masses of the greenish variety , being embedded in the white variety ; —in this latter case , the appearance was very much like that of a sedimentary deposit , torn up and abraded during the deposition of a subsequent stratum . Both these varieties are traversed by innumerable tortuous veins ( presently to be described ) , which are totally unlike injected dikes , or indeed any other veins which I have ever seen . Both varieties include a few scattered fragments , large and small , of dark- coloured scoriaceous rocks , the cells of some of which are partially filled with the white earthy stone ; they likewise include some huge blocks of a cellular porphyry . ( The porphyry is dark coloured ; it contains numerous , often fractured , crystals of white opaque feldspar , also decomposing crystals of oxide of iron ; its vesicles include masses of delicate , hair- like , crystals , apparently of analcime . ) These fragments project from the weathered surface , and perfectly resemble fragments embedded in a true sedimentary tuff . But as it is known that extraneous fragments of cellular rock are sometimes included in columnar trachyte , in phonolite ( D ’ Aubuisson “ Traite de Geognosie ” tome 2 page 548 . ) , and in other compact lavas , this circumstance is not any real argument for the sedimentary origin of the white earthy stone . ( Dr. Daubeny on Volcanoes , page 180 seems to have been led to believe that certain trachytic formations of Ischia and of the Puy de Dome , which closely resemble these of Ascension , were of sedimentary origin , chiefly from the frequent presence in them “ of scoriform portions , different in colour from the matrix. ” Dr. Daubeny adds , that on the other hand , Brocchi , and other eminent geologists , have considered these beds as earthy varieties of trachyte ; he considers the subject deserving of further attention . ) The insensible passage of the greenish variety into the white one , and likewise the more abrupt passage by fragments of the former being embedded in the latter , might result from slight differences in the composition of the same mass of molten stone , and from the abrading action of one such part still fluid on another part already solidified . The curiously formed veins have , I believe , been formed by siliceous matter being subsequently segregated . But my chief reason for believing that these soft earthy stones , with their extraneous fragments , are not of sedimentary origin , is the extreme improbability of crystals of feldspar , black microscopical specks , and small stains of a darker colour occurring in the same proportional numbers in an aqueous deposit , and in masses of solid trachyte . Moreover , as I have remarked , the microscope occasionally reveals a crystalline structure in the apparently earthy basis . On the other hand , the partial decomposition of such great masses of trachyte , forming whole mountains , is undoubtedly a circumstance of not easy explanation . VEINS IN THE EARTHY TRACHYTIC MASSES . These veins are extraordinarily numerous , intersecting in the most complicated manner both coloured varieties of the earthy trachyte : they are best seen on the flanks of the “ Crater of the old volcano. ” They contain crystals of glassy feldspar , black microscopical specks and little dark stains , precisely as in the surrounding rock ; but the basis is very different , being exceedingly hard , compact , somewhat brittle , and of rather less easy fusibility . The veins vary much , and suddenly , from the tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness ; they often thin out , not only on their edges , but in their central parts , thus leaving round , irregular apertures ; their surfaces are rugged . They are inclined at every possible angle with the horizon , or are horizontal ; they are generally curvilinear , and often interbranch one with another . From their hardness they withstand weathering , and projecting two or three feet above the ground , they occasionally extend some yards in length ; these plate-like veins , when struck , emit a sound , almost like that of a drum , and they may be distinctly seen to vibrate ; their fragments , which are strewed on the ground , clatter like pieces of iron when knocked against each other . They often assume the most singular forms ; I saw a pedestal of the earthy trachyte , covered by a hemispherical portion of a vein , like a great umbrella , sufficiently large to shelter two persons . I have never met with , or seen described , any veins like these ; but in form they resemble the ferruginous seams , due to some process of segregation , occurring not uncommonly in sandstones , —for instance , in the New Red sandstone of England . Numerous veins of jasper and of siliceous sinter , occurring on the summit of this same hill , show that there has been some abundant source of silica , and as these plate-like veins differ from the trachyte only in their greater hardness , brittleness , and less easy fusibility , it appears probable that their origin is due to the segregation or infiltration of siliceous matter , in the same manner as happens with the oxides of iron in many sedimentary rocks . SILICEOUS SINTER AND JASPER . The siliceous sinter is either quite white , of little specific gravity , and with a somewhat pearly fracture , passing into pinkish pearl quartz ; or it is yellowish white , with a harsh fracture , and it then contains an earthy powder in small cavities . Both varieties occur , either in large irregular masses in the altered trachyte , or in seams included in broad , vertical , tortuous , irregular veins of a compact , harsh stone of a dull red colour , appearing like a sandstone . This stone , however , is only altered trachyte ; and a nearly similar variety , but often honeycombed , sometimes adheres to the projecting plate-like veins , described in the last paragraph . The jasper is of an ochre yellow or red colour ; it occurs in large irregular masses , and sometimes in veins , both in the altered trachyte and in an associated mass of scoriaceous basalt . The cells of the scoriaceous basalt are lined or filled with fine , concentric layers of chalcedony , coated and studded with bright-red oxide of iron . In this rock , especially in the rather more compact parts , irregular angular patches of the red jasper are included , the edges of which insensibly blend into the surrounding mass ; other patches occur having an intermediate character between perfect jasper and the ferruginous , decomposed , basaltic base . In these patches , and likewise in the large vein-like masses of jasper , there occur little rounded cavities , of exactly the same size and form with the air-cells , which in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined with layers of chalcedony . Small fragments of the jasper , examined under the microscope , seem to resemble the chalcedony with its colouring matter not separated into layers , but mingled in the siliceous paste , together with some impurities . I can understand these facts , —namely , the blending of the jasper into the semi-decomposed basalt , —its occurrence in angular patches , which clearly do not occupy pre-existing hollows in the rock , —and its containing little vesicles filled with chalcedony , like those in the scoriaceous lava , —only on the supposition that a fluid , probably the same fluid which deposited the chalcedony in the air-cells , removed in those parts where there were no cavities , the ingredients of the basaltic rock , and left in their place silica and iron , and thus produced the jasper . In some specimens of silicified wood , I have observed , that in the same manner as in the basalt , the solid parts were converted into a dark-coloured homogeneous stone , whereas the cavities formed by the larger sap-vessels ( which may be compared with the air-vesicles in the basaltic lava ) and other irregular hollows , apparently produced by decay , were filled with concentric layers of chalcedony ; in this case , there can be little doubt that the same fluid deposited the homogeneous base and the chalcedonic layers . After these considerations , I can not doubt but that the jasper of Ascension may be viewed as a volcanic rock silicified , in precisely the same sense as this term is applied to wood , when silicified ; we are equally ignorant of the means by which every atom of wood , whilst in a perfect state , is removed and replaced by atoms of silica , as we are of the means by which the constituent parts of a volcanic rock could be thus acted on . ( Beudant “ Voyage en Hongrie ” tome 3 pages 502 , 504 describes kidney-shaped masses of jasper-opal , which either blend into the surrounding trachytic conglomerate , or are embedded in it like chalk-flints ; and he compares them with the fragments of opalised wood , which are abundant in this same formation . Beudant , however , appears to have viewed the process of their formation rather as one of simple infiltration than of molecular exchange ; but the presence of a concretion , wholly different from the surrounding matter , if not formed in a pre-existing hollow , clearly seems to me to require , either a molecular or mechanical displacement of the atoms , which occupied the space afterwards filled by it . The jasper-opal of Hungary passes into chalcedony , and therefore in this case , as in that of Ascension , jasper seems to be intimately related in origin with chalcedony . ) I was led to the careful examination of these rocks , and to the conclusion here given , from having heard the Rev . Professor Henslow express a similar opinion , regarding the origin in trap-rocks of many chalcedonies and agates . Siliceous deposits seem to be very general , if not of universal occurrence , in partially decomposed trachytic tuffs ( Beudant “ Voyage Min. ” tome 3 page 507 enumerates cases in Hungary , Germany , Central France , Italy , Greece , and Mexico . ) ; and as these hills , according to the view above given , consist of trachyte softened and altered in situ , the presence of free silica in this case may be added as one more instance to the list . CONCRETIONS IN PUMICEOUS TUFF . The hill , marked in Map 2 “ Crater of an old volcano , ” has no claims to this appellation , which I could discover , except in being surmounted by a circular , very shallow , saucer-like summit , nearly half a mile in diameter . This hollow has been nearly filled up with many successive sheets of ashes and scoriae , of different colours , and slightly consolidated . Each successive saucer-shaped layer crops out all round the margin , forming so many rings of various colours , and giving to the hill a fantastic appearance . The outer ring is broad , and of a white colour ; hence it resembles a course round which horses have been exercised , and has received the name of the Devil ’ s Riding School , by which it is most generally known . These successive layers of ashes must have fallen over the whole surrounding country , but they have all been blown away except in this one hollow , in which probably moisture accumulated , either during an extraordinary year when rain fell , or during the storms often accompanying volcanic eruptions . One of the layers of a pinkish colour , and chiefly derived from small , decomposed fragments of pumice , is remarkable , from containing numerous concretions . These are generally spherical , from half an inch to three inches in diameter ; but they are occasionally cylindrical , like those of iron-pyrites in the chalk of Europe . They consist of a very tough , compact , pale-brown stone , with a smooth and even fracture . They are divided into concentric layers by thin white partitions , resembling the external superficies ; six or eight of such layers are distinctly defined near the outside ; but those towards the inside generally become indistinct , and blend into a homogeneous mass . I presume that these concentric layers were formed by the shrinking of the concretion , as it became compact . The interior part is generally fissured by minute cracks or septaria , which are lined , both by black , metallic , and by other white and crystalline specks , the nature of which I was unable to ascertain . Some of the larger concretions consist of a mere spherical shell , filled with slightly consolidated ashes . The concretions contain a small proportion of carbonate of lime : a fragment placed under the blowpipe decrepitates , then whitens and fuses into a blebby enamel , but does not become caustic . The surrounding ashes do not contain any carbonate of lime ; hence the concretions have probably been formed , as is so often the case , by the aggregation of this substance . I have not met with any account of similar concretions ; and considering their great toughness and compactness , their occurrence in a bed , which probably has been subjected only to atmospheric moisture , is remarkable . FORMATION OF CALCAREOUS ROCKS ON THE SEA-COAST . On several of the sea-beaches , there are immense accumulations of small , well-rounded particles of shells and corals , of white , yellowish , and pink colours , interspersed with a few volcanic particles . At the depth of a few feet , these are found cemented together into stone , of which the softer varieties are used for building ; there are other varieties , both coarse and fine-grained , too hard for this purpose : and I saw one mass divided into even layers half an inch in thickness , which were so compact that when struck with a hammer they rang like flint . It is believed by the inhabitants , that the particles become united in the course of a single year . The union is effected by calcareous matter ; and in the most compact varieties , each rounded particle of shell and volcanic rock can be distinctly seen to be enveloped in a husk of pellucid carbonate of lime . Extremely few perfect shells are embedded in these agglutinated masses ; and I have examined even a large fragment under a microscope , without being able to discover the least vestige of striae or other marks of external form : this shows how long each particle must have been rolled about , before its turn came to be embedded and cemented . ( The eggs of the turtle being buried by the parent , sometimes become enclosed in the solid rock . Mr. Lyell has given a figure ( “ Principles of Geology ” book 3 chapter 17 ) of some eggs , containing the bones of young turtles , found thus entombed . ) One of the most compact varieties , when placed in acid , was entirely dissolved , with the exception of some flocculent animal matter ; its specific gravity was 2.63 . The specific gravity of ordinary limestone varies from 2.6 to 2.75 ; pure Carrara marble was found by Sir H. De la Beche to be 2.7 . ( “ Researches in Theoretical Geology ” page 12 . ) It is remarkable that these rocks of Ascension , formed close to the surface , should be nearly as compact as marble , which has undergone the action of heat and pressure in the plutonic regions . The great accumulation of loose calcareous particles , lying on the beach near the Settlement , commences in the month of October , moving towards the S.W. , which , as I was informed by Lieutenant Evans , is caused by a change in the prevailing direction of the currents . At this period the tidal rocks , at the S.W . end of the beach , where the calcareous sand is accumulating , and round which the currents sweep , become gradually coated with a calcareous incrustation , half an inch in thickness . It is quite white , compact , with some parts slightly spathose , and is firmly attached to the rock . After a short time it gradually disappears , being either redissolved , when the water is less charged with lime , or more probably is mechanically abraded . Lieutenant Evans has observed these facts , during the six years he has resided at Ascension . The incrustation varies in thickness in different years : in 1831 it was unusually thick . When I was there in July , there was no remnant of the incrustation ; but on a point of basalt , from which the quarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous freestone , the incrustation was perfectly preserved . Considering the position of the tidal-rocks , and the period at which they become coated , there can be no doubt that the movement and disturbance of the vast accumulation of calcareous particles , many of them being partially agglutinated together , cause the waves of the sea to be so highly charged with carbonate of lime , that they deposit it on the first objects against which they impinge . I have been informed by Lieutenant Holland , R.N. , that this incrustation is formed on many parts of the coast , on most of which , I believe , there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells . A FRONDESCENT CALCAREOUS INCRUSTATION . ( FIGURE 5 . AN INCRUSTATION OF CALCAREOUS AND ANIMAL MATTER , coating the tidal-rocks at Ascension . ) In many respects this is a singular deposit ; it coats throughout the year the tidal volcanic rocks , that project from the beaches composed of broken shells . Its general appearance is well represented in Figure 5 ; but the fronds or discs , of which it is composed , are generally so closely crowded together as to touch . These fronds have their sinuous edges finely crenulated , and they project over their pedestals or supports ; their upper surfaces are either slightly concave , or slightly convex ; they are highly polished , and of a dark grey or jet black colour ; their form is irregular , generally circular , and from the tenth of an inch to one inch and a half in diameter ; their thickness , or amount of their projection from the rock on which they stand , varies much , about a quarter of an inch being perhaps most usual . The fronds occasionally become more and more convex , until they pass into botryoidal masses with their summits fissured ; when in this state , they are glossy and of an intense black , so as to resemble some fused metallic substance . I have shown the incrustation , both in this latter and in its ordinary state to several geologists , but not one could conjecture its origin , except that perhaps it was of volcanic nature ! The substance forming the fronds has a very compact and often almost crystalline fracture ; the edges being translucent , and hard enough easily to scratch calcareous spar . Under the blowpipe it immediately becomes white , and emits a strong animal odour , like that from fresh shells . It is chiefly composed of carbonate of lime ; when placed in muriatic acid it froths much , leaving a residue of sulphate of lime , and of an oxide of iron , together with a black powder , which is not soluble in heated acids . This latter substance seems to be carbonaceous , and is evidently the colouring matter . The sulphate of lime is extraneous , and occurs in distinct , excessively minute , lamellar plates , studded on the surface of the fronds , and embedded between the fine layers of which they are composed ; when a fragment is heated in the blowpipe , these lamellae are immediately rendered visible . The original outline of the fronds may often be traced , either to a minute particle of shell fixed in a crevice of the rock , or to several cemented together ; these first become deeply corroded , by the dissolving power of the waves , into sharp ridges , and then are coated with successive layers of the glossy , grey , calcareous incrustation . The inequalities of the primary support affect the outline of every successive layer , in the same manner as may often be seen in bezoar-stones , when an object like a nail forms the centre of aggregation . The crenulated edges , however , of the frond appear to be due to the corroding power of the surf on its own deposit , alternating with fresh depositions . On some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of St. Jago , I found an exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter , which under a lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and polished fronds of Ascension ; in this case a basis was not afforded by any projecting extraneous particles . Although the incrustation at Ascension is persistent throughout the year ; yet from the abraded appearance of some parts , and from the fresh appearance of other parts , the whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation , due probably to changes in the form of the shifting beach , and consequently in the action of the breakers : hence probably it is , that the incrustation never acquires a great thickness . Considering the position of the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous beach , together with its composition , I think there can be no doubt that its origin is due to the dissolution and subsequent deposition of the matter composing the rounded particles of shells and corals . ( The selenite , as I have remarked is extraneous , and must have been derived from the sea-water . It is an interesting circumstance thus to find the waves of the ocean , sufficiently charged with sulphate of lime , to deposit it on the rocks , against which they dash every tide . Dr. Webster has described ( “ Voyage of the ‘ Chanticleer ’ ” volume 2 page 319 ) beds of gypsum and salt , as much as two feet in thickness , left by the evaporation of the spray on the rocks on the windward coast . Beautiful stalactites of selenite , resembling in form those of carbonate of lime , are formed near these beds . Amorphous masses of gypsum , also , occur in caverns in the interior of the island ; and at Cross Hill ( an old crater ) I saw a considerable quantity of salt oozing from a pile of scoriae . In these latter cases , the salt and gypsum appear to be volcanic products . ) From this source it derives its animal matter , which is evidently the colouring principle . The nature of the deposit , in its incipient stage , can often be well seen upon a fragment of white shell , when jammed between two of the fronds ; it then appears exactly like the thinnest wash of a pale grey varnish . Its darkness varies a little , but the jet blackness of some of the fronds and of the botryoidal masses seems due to the translucency of the successive grey layers . There is , however , this singular circumstance , that when deposited on the under side of ledges of rock or in fissures , it appears always to be of a pale , pearly grey colour , even when of considerable thickness : hence one is led to suppose , that an abundance of light is necessary to the development of the dark colour , in the same manner as seems to be the case with the upper and exposed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca , which are always dark , compared with their under surfaces and with the parts habitually covered by the mantle of the animal . In this circumstance , —in the immediate loss of colour and in the odour emitted under the blowpipe , —in the degree of hardness and translucency of the edges , —and in the beautiful polish of the surface ( From the fact described in my “ Journal of Researches ” of a coating of oxide of iron , deposited by a streamlet on the rocks in its bed ( like a nearly similar coating at the great cataracts of the Orinoco and Nile ) , becoming finely polished where the surf acts , I presume that the surf in this instance , also , is the polishing agent . ) , rivalling when in a fresh state that of the finest Oliva , there is a striking analogy between this inorganic incrustation and the shells of living molluscous animals . ( In the section descriptive of St. Paul ’ s Rocks , I have described a glossy , pearly substance , which coats the rocks , and an allied stalactitical incrustation from Ascension , the crust of which resembles the enamel of teeth , but is hard enough to scratch plate-glass . Both these substances contain animal matter , and seem to have been derived from water in filtering through birds ’ dung . ) This appears to me to be an interesting physiological fact . ( Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described “ Philosophical Transactions ” 1836 page 65 a singular “ artificial substance , resembling shell. ” It is deposited in fine , transparent , highly polished , brown- coloured laminae , possessing peculiar optical properties , on the inside of a vessel , in which cloth , first prepared with glue and then with lime , is made to revolve rapidly in water . It is much softer , more transparent , and contains more animal matter , than the natural incrustation at Ascension ; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell . ) SINGULAR LAMINATED BEDS ALTERNATING WITH AND PASSING INTO OBSIDIAN . These beds occur within the trachytic district , at the western base of Green Mountain , under which they dip at a high inclination . They are only partially exposed , being covered up by modern ejections ; from this cause , I was unable to trace their junction with the trachyte , or to discover whether they had flowed as a stream of lava , or had been injected amidst the overlying strata . There are three principal beds of obsidian , of which the thickest forms the base of the section . The alternating stony layers appear to me eminently curious , and shall be first described , and afterwards their passage into the obsidian . They have an extremely diversified appearance ; five principal varieties may be noticed , but these insensibly blend into each other by endless gradations . FIRST . A pale grey , irregularly and coarsely laminated ( This term is open to some misinterpretation , as it may be applied both to rocks divided into laminae of exactly the same composition , and to layers firmly attached to each other , with no fissile tendency , but composed of different minerals , or of different shades of colour . The term “ laminated , ” in this chapter , is applied in these latter senses ; where a homogeneous rock splits , as in the former sense , in a given direction , like clay-slate , I have used the term “ fissile. ” ) , harsh-feeling rock , resembling clay-slate which has been in contact with a trap-dike , and with a fracture of about the same degree of crystalline structure . This rock , as well as the following varieties , easily fuses into a pale glass . The greater part is honeycombed with irregular , angular , cavities , so that the whole has a curious appearance , and some fragments resemble in a remarkable manner silicified logs of decayed wood . This variety , especially where more compact , is often marked with thin whitish streaks , which are either straight or wrap round , one behind the other , the elongated carious hollows . SECONDLY . A bluish grey or pale brown , compact , heavy , homogeneous stone , with an angular , uneven , earthy fracture ; viewed , however , under a lens of high power , the fracture is seen to be distinctly crystalline , and even separate minerals can be distinguished . THIRDLY . A stone of the same kind with the last , but streaked with numerous , parallel , slightly tortuous , white lines of the thickness of hairs . These white lines are more crystalline than the parts between them ; and the stone splits along them : they frequently expand into exceedingly thin cavities , which are often only just perceptible with a lens . The matter forming the white lines becomes better crystallised in these cavities , and Professor Miller was fortunate enough , after several trials , to ascertain that the white crystals , which are the largest , were of quartz ( Professor Miller informs me that the crystals which he measured had the faces P , z , m of the figure ( 147 ) given by Haidinger in his Translation of Mohs ; and he adds , that it is remarkable , that none of them had the slightest trace of faces r of the regular six-sided prism . ) , and that the minute green transparent needles were augite , or , as they would more generally be called , diopside : besides these crystals , there are some minute , dark specks without a trace of crystalline , and some fine , white , granular , crystalline matter which is probably feldspar . Minute fragments of this rock are easily fusible . FOURTHLY . A compact crystalline rock , banded in straight lines with innumerable layers of white and grey shades of colour , varying in width from the thirtieth to the two-hundredth of an inch ; these layers seem to be composed chiefly of feldspar , and they contain numerous perfect crystals of glassy feldspar , which are placed lengthways ; they are also thickly studded with microscopically minute , amorphous , black specks , which are placed in rows , either standing separately , or more frequently united , two or three or several together , into black lines , thinner than a hair . When a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe , the black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads , which become magnetic , —characters that apply to no common mineral except hornblende or augite . With the black specks there are mingled some others of a red colour , which are magnetic before being heated , and no doubt are oxide of iron . Round two little cavities , in a specimen of this variety , I found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals , appearing like those of augite or hornblende , but too dull and small to be measured by the goniometer ; in the specimen , also , I could distinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar , grains , which had the aspect of quartz . By trying with a parallel ruler , I found that the thin grey layers and the black hair-like lines were absolutely straight and parallel to each other . It is impossible to trace the gradation from the homogeneous grey rocks to these striped varieties , or indeed the character of the different layers in the same specimen , without feeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the crystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect aggregation of diffused matter , into the black and red specks of hornblende and oxide of iron .

A compact heavy rock , not laminated , with an irregular , angular , highly crystalline , fracture ; it abounds with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar , and the crystalline feldspathic base is mottled with a black mineral , which on the weathered surface is seen to be aggregated into small crystals , some perfect , but the greater number imperfect . I showed this specimen to an experienced geologist , and asked him what it was ; he answered , as I think every one else would have done , that it was a primitive greenstone . The weathered surface , also , of the banded variety in Figure 4 , strikingly resembles a worn fragment of finely laminated gneiss . These five varieties , with many intermediate ones , pass and repass into each other . As the compact varieties are quite subordinate to the others , the whole may be considered as laminated or striped . The laminae , to sum up their characteristics , are either quite straight , or slightly tortuous , or convoluted ; they are all parallel to each other , and to the intercalating strata of obsidian ; they are generally of extreme thinness ; they consist either of an apparently homogeneous , compact rock , striped with different shades of grey and brown colours , or of crystalline feldspathic layers in a more or less perfect state of purity , and of different thicknesses , with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar placed lengthways , or of very thin layers chiefly composed of minute crystals of quartz and augite , or composed of black and red specks of an augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron , either not crystallised or imperfectly so . After having fully described the obsidian , I shall return to the subject of the lamination of rocks of the trachytic series . The passage of the foregoing beds into the strata of glassy obsidian is effected in several ways : first , angulo-modular masses of obsidian , both large and small , abruptly appear disseminated in a slaty , or in an amorphous , pale-coloured , feldspathic rock , with a somewhat pearly fracture . Secondly , small irregular nodules of the obsidian , either standing separately , or united into thin layers , seldom more than the tenth of an inch in thickness , alternate repeatedly with very thin layers of a feldspathic rock , which is striped with the finest parallel zones of colour , like an agate , and which sometimes passes into the nature of pitchstone ; the interstices between the nodules of obsidian are generally filled by soft white matter , resembling pumiceous ashes . Thirdly , the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into an angulo-concretionary mass of obsidian . Such masses ( as well as the small nodules ) of obsidian are of a pale green colour , and are generally streaked with different shades of colour , parallel to the laminae of the surrounding rock ; they likewise generally contain minute white sphaerulites , of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of one shade of colour , and half in a zone of another shade . The obsidian assumes its jet black colour and perfectly conchoidal fracture , only when in large masses ; but even in these , on careful examination and on holding the specimens in different lights , I could generally distinguish parallel streaks of different shades of darkness . ( FIGURE 6 . OPAQUE BROWN SPHAERULITES , drawn on an enlarged scale . The upper ones are externally marked with parallel ridges . The internal radiating structure of the lower ones , is much too plainly represented . FIGURE 7 . A LAYER FORMED BY THE UNION OF MINUTE BROWN SPHAERULITES , INTERSECTING TWO OTHER SIMILAR LAYERS : the whole represented of nearly the natural size . ) One of the commonest transitional rocks deserves in several respects a further description . It is of a very complicated nature , and consists of numerous thin , slightly tortuous layers of a pale-coloured feldspathic stone , often passing into an imperfect pitchstone , alternating with layers formed of numberless little globules of two varieties of obsidian , and of two kinds of sphaerulites , embedded in a soft or in a hard pearly base . The sphaerulites are either white and translucent , or dark brown and opaque ; the former are quite spherical , of small size , and distinctly radiated from their centre . The dark brown sphaerulites are less perfectly round , and vary in diameter from the twentieth to the thirtieth of an inch ; when broken they exhibit towards their centres , which are whitish , an obscure radiating structure ; two of them when united sometimes have only one central point of radiation ; there is occasionally a trace of or a hollow crevice in their centres . They stand either separately , or are united two or three or many together into irregular groups , or more commonly into layers , parallel to the stratification of the mass . This union in many cases is so perfect , that the two sides of the layer thus formed , are quite even ; and these layers , as they become less brown and opaque , can not be distinguished from the alternating layers of the pale-coloured feldspathic stone . The sphaerulites , when not united , are generally compressed in the plane of the lamination of the mass ; and in this same plane , they are often marked internally , by zones of different shades of colour , and externally by small ridges and furrows . In the upper part of Figure 6 , the sphaerulites with the parallel ridges and furrows are represented on an enlarged scale , but they are not well executed ; and in the lower part , their usual manner of grouping is shown . In another specimen , a thin layer formed of the brown sphaerulites closely united together , intersects , as represented in Figure 7 , a layer of similar composition ; and after running for a short space in a slightly curved line , again intersects it , and likewise a second layer lying a little way beneath that first intersected . The small nodules also of obsidian are sometimes externally marked with ridges and furrows , parallel to the lamination of the mass , but always less plainly than the sphaerulites . These obsidian nodules are generally angular , with their edges blunted : they are often impressed with the form of the adjoining sphaerulites , than which they are always larger ; the separate nodules seldom appear to have drawn each other out by exerting a mutually attractive force . Had I not found in some cases , a distinct centre of attraction in these nodules of obsidian , I should have been led to have considered them as residuary matter , left during the formation of the pearlstone , in which they are embedded , and of the sphaerulitic globules . The sphaerulites and the little nodules of obsidian in these rocks so closely resemble , in general form and structure , concretions in sedimentary deposits , that one is at once tempted to attribute to them an analogous origin . They resemble ordinary concretions in the following respects : in their external form , —in the union of two or three , or of several , into an irregular mass , or into an even-sided layer , —in the occasional intersection of one such layer by another , as in the case of chalk-flints , - -in the presence of two or three kinds of nodules , often close together , in the same basis , —in their fibrous , radiating structure , with occasional hollows in their centres , —in the co-existence of a laminary , concretionary , and radiating structure , as is so well developed in the concretions of magnesian limestone , described by Professor Sedgwick . ( “ Geological Transactions ” volume 3 part 1 page 37 . ) Concretions in sedimentary deposits , it is known , are due to the separation from the surrounding mass of the whole or part of some mineral substance , and its aggregation round certain points of attraction . Guided by this fact , I have endeavoured to discover whether obsidian and the sphaerulites ( to which may be added marekanite and pearlstone , both of them occurring in nodular concretions in the trachytic series ) differ in their constituent parts , from the minerals generally composing trachytic rocks . It appears from three analyses , that obsidian contains on an average 76 per cent of silica ; from one analysis , that sphaerulites contain 79.12 ; from two , that marekanite contains 79.25 ; and from two other analyses , that pearlstone contains 75.62 of silica . ( The foregoing analyses are taken from Beudant “ Traite de Mineralogie ” tome 2 page 113 ; and one analysis of obsidian from Phillips “ Mineralogy. ” ) Now , the constituent parts of trachyte , as far as they can be distinguished consist of feldspar , containing 65.21 of silica ; or of albite , containing 69.09 ; of hornblende , containing 55.27 ( These analyses are taken from Von Kobell “ Grundzuge der Mineralogie ” 1838 . ) , and of oxide of iron : so that the foregoing glassy concretionary substances all contain a larger proportion of silica than that occurring in ordinary feldspathic or trachytic rocks . D ’ Aubuisson ( “ Traite de Geogn. ” tome 2 page 535 . ) , also , has remarked on the large proportion of silica compared with alumina , in six analyses of obsidian and pearlstone given in Brongniart ’ s “ Mineralogy. ” Hence I conclude , that the foregoing concretions have been formed by a process of aggregation , strictly analogous to that which takes place in aqueous deposits , acting chiefly on the silica , but likewise on some of the other elements of the surrounding mass , and thus producing the different concretionary varieties . From the well-known effects of rapid cooling ( This is seen in the manufacture of common glass , and in Gregory Watts ’ s experiments on molten trap ; also on the natural surfaces of lava- streams , and on the side-walls of dikes . ) in giving glassiness of texture , it is probably necessary that the entire mass , in cases like that of Ascension , should have cooled at a certain rate ; but considering the repeated and complicated alterations of nodules and thin layers of a glassy texture with other layers quite stony or crystalline , all within the space of a few feet or even inches , it is hardly possible that they could have cooled at different rates , and thus have acquired their different textures . The natural sphaerulites in these rocks very closely resemble those produced in glass , when slowly cooled . ( I do not know whether it is generally known , that bodies having exactly the same appearance as sphaerulites , sometimes occur in agates . Mr. Robert Brown showed me in an agate , formed within a cavity in a piece of silicified wood , some little specks , which were only just visible to the naked eye : these specks , when placed by him under a lens of high power , presented a beautiful appearance : they were perfectly circular , and consisted of the finest fibres of a brown colour , radiating with great exactness from a common centre . These little radiating stars are occasionally intersected , and portions are quite cut off by the fine , ribbon-like zones of colour in the agate . In the obsidian of Ascension , the halves of a sphaerulite often lie in different zones of colour , but they are not cut off by them , as in the agate . ) In some fine specimens of partially devitrified glass , in the possession of Mr. Stokes , the sphaerulites are united into straight layers with even sides , parallel to each other , and to one of the outer surfaces , exactly as in the obsidian . These layers sometimes interbranch and form loops ; but I did not see any case of actual intersection . They form the passage from the perfectly glassy portions , to those nearly homogeneous and stony , with only an obscure concretionary structure . In the same specimen , also , sphaerulites differing slightly in colour and in structure , occur embedded close together . Considering these facts , it is some confirmation of the view above given of the concretionary origin of the obsidian and natural sphaerulites , to find that M. Dartigues ( “ Journal de Physique ” tome 59 1804 pages 10 , 12 . ) , in his curious paper on this subject , attributes the production of sphaerulites in glass , to the different ingredients obeying their own laws of attraction and becoming aggregated . He is led to believe that this takes place , from the difficulty in remelting sphaerulitic glass , without the whole be first thoroughly pounded and mixed together ; and likewise from the fact , that the change takes place most readily in glass composed of many ingredients . In confirmation of M. Dartigues ’ view , I may remark , that M. Fleuriau de Bellevue ( Idem tome 60 1805 page 418 . ) found that the sphaerulitic portions of devitrified glass were acted on both by nitric acid and under the blowpipe , in a different manner from the compact paste in which they were embedded . COMPARISON OF THE OBSIDIAN BEDS AND ALTERNATING STRATA OF ASCENSION , WITH THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES . I have been struck with much surprise , how closely the excellent description of the obsidian rocks of Hungary , given by Beudant ( “ Voyage en Hongrie ” tome 1 page 330 ; tome 2 pages 221 and 315 ; tome 3 pages 369 , 371 , 377 , 381 . ) , and that by Humboldt , of the same formation in Mexico and Peru ( “ Essai Geognostique ” pages 176 , 326 , 328 . ) , and likewise the descriptions given by several authors ( P. Scrope “ Geological Transactions ” volume 2 second series page 195 . Consult also Dolomieu “ Voyage aux Isles Lipari ” and D ’ Aubuisson “ Traite de Geogn. ” tome 2 page 534 . ) of the trachytic regions in the Italian islands , agree with my observations at Ascension . Many passages might have been transferred without alteration from the works of the above authors , and would have been applicable to this island . They all agree in the laminated and stratified character of the whole series ; and Humboldt speaks of some of the beds of obsidian being ribboned like jasper . ( In Mr. Stokes ’ fine collection of obsidians from Mexico , I observe that the sphaerulites are generally much larger than those of Ascension ; they are generally white , opaque , and are united into distinct layers : there are many singular varieties , different from any at Ascension . The obsidians are finely zoned , in quite straight or curved lines , with exceedingly slight differences of tint , of cellularity , and of more or less perfect degrees of glassiness . Tracing some of the less perfectly glassy zones , they are seen to become studded with minute white sphaerulites , which become more and more numerous , until at last they unite and form a distinct layer : on the other hand , at Ascension , only the brown sphaerulites unite and form layers ; the white ones always being irregularly disseminated . Some specimens at the Geological Society , said to belong to an obsidian formation from Mexico , have an earthy fracture , and are divided in the finest parallel laminae , by specks of a black mineral , like the augitic or hornblendic specks in the rocks at Ascension . ) They all agree in the nodular or concretionary character of the obsidian , and of the passage of these nodules into layers . They all refer to the repeated alterations , often in undulatory planes , of glassy , pearly , stony , and crystalline layers : the crystalline layers , however , seem to be much more perfectly developed at Ascension , than in the above-named countries . Humboldt compares some of the stony beds , when viewed from a distance , to strata of a schistose sandstone . Sphaerulites are described as occurring abundantly in all cases ; and they everywhere seem to mark the passage , from the perfectly glassy to the stony and crystalline beds . Beudant ’ s account ( Beudant “ Voyage ” tome 3 page 373 . ) of his “ perlite lithoide globulaire ” in every , even the most trifling particular , might have been written for the little brown sphaerulitic globules of the rocks of Ascension . From the close similarity in so many respects , between the obsidian formations of Hungary , Mexico , Peru , and of some of the Italian islands , with that of Ascension , I can hardly doubt that in all these cases , the obsidian and the sphaerulites owe their origin to a concretionary aggregation of the silica , and of some of the other constituent elements , taking place whilst the liquified mass cooled at a certain required rate . It is , however , well-known , that in several places , obsidian has flowed in streams like lava ; for instance , at Teneriffe , at the Lipari Islands , and at Iceland . ( For Teneriffe see von Buch “ Descript . des Isles Canaries ” pages 184 and 190 ; for the Lipari Islands see Dolomieu “ Voyage ” page 34 ; for Iceland see Mackenzie “ Travels ” page 369 . ) In these cases , the superficial parts are the most perfectly glassy , the obsidian passing at the depth of a few feet into an opaque stone . In an analysis by Vauquelin of a specimen of obsidian from Hecla , which probably flowed as lava , the proportion of silica is nearly the same as in the nodular or concretionary obsidian from Mexico . It would be interesting to ascertain , whether the opaque interior portions and the superficial glassy coating contained the same proportional constituent parts : we know from M. Dufrenoy ( “ Memoires pour servir a une Descript . Geolog . de la France ” tome 4 page 371 . ) that the exterior and interior parts of the same stream of lava sometimes differ considerably in their composition . Even should the whole body of the stream of obsidian turn out to be similarly composed with nodular obsidian , it would only be necessary , in accordance with the foregoing facts , to suppose that lava in these instances had been erupted with its ingredients mixed in the same proportion , as in the concretionary obsidian . LAMINATION OF VOLCANIC ROCKS OF THE TRACHYTIC SERIES . We have seen that , in several and widely distant countries , the strata alternating with beds of obsidian , are highly laminated . The nodules , also , both large and small , of the obsidian , are zoned with different shades of colour ; and I have seen a specimen from Mexico in Mr. Stokes ’ collection , with its external surface weathered ( MacCulloch states “ Classification of Rocks ” page 531 that the exposed surfaces of the pitchstone dikes in Arran are furrowed “ with undulating lines , resembling certain varieties of marbled paper , and which evidently result from some corresponding difference of laminar structure. ” ) into ridges and furrows , corresponding with the zones of different degrees of glassiness : Humboldt ( “ Personal Narrative ” volume 1 page 222 . ) , moreover , found on the Peak of Teneriffe , a stream of obsidian divided by very thin , alternating , layers of pumice . Many other lavas of the feldspathic series are laminated ; thus , masses of common trachyte at Ascension are divided by fine earthy lines , along which the rock splits , separating thin layers of slightly different shades of colour ; the greater number , also , of the embedded crystals of glassy feldspar are placed lengthways in the same direction . Mr. P. Scrope ( “ Geological Transactions ” volume 2 second series page 195 . ) has described a remarkable columnar trachyte in the Panza Islands , which seems to have been injected into an overlying mass of trachytic conglomerate : it is striped with zones , often of extreme tenuity , of different textures and colours ; the harder and darker zones appearing to contain a larger proportion of silica . In another part of the island , there are layers of pearlstone and pitchstone , which in many respects resemble those of Ascension . The zones in the columnar trachyte are generally contorted ; they extend uninterruptedly for a great length in a vertical direction , and apparently parallel to the walls of the dike-like mass . Von Buch ( “ Description des Iles Canaries ” page 184 . ) has described at Teneriffe , a stream of lava containing innumerable thin , plate-like crystals of feldspar , which are arranged like white threads , one behind the other , and which mostly follow the same direction . Dolomieu ( “ Voyage aux Isles de Lipari ” pages 35 and 85 . ) also states , that the grey lavas of the modern cone of Vulcano , which have a vitreous texture , are streaked with parallel white lines : he further describes a solid pumice-stone which possesses a fissile structure , like that of certain micaceous schists . Phonolite , which I may observe is often , if not always , an injected rock , also , often has a fissile structure ; this is generally due to the parallel position of the embedded crystals of feldspar , but sometimes , as at Fernando Noronha , seems to be nearly independent of their presence . ( In this case , and in that of the fissile pumice-stone , the structure is very different from that in the foregoing cases , where the laminae consist of alternate layers of different composition or texture . In some sedimentary formations , however , which apparently are homogeneous and fissile , as in glossy clay-slate , there is reason to believe , according to D ’ Aubuisson , that the laminae are really due to excessively thin , alternating , layers of mica . ) From these facts we see , that various rocks of the feldspathic series have either a laminated or fissile structure , and that it occurs both in masses which have injected into overlying strata , and in others which have flowed as streams of lava . The laminae of the beds , alternating with the obsidian at Ascension , dip at a high angle under the mountain , at the base of which they are situated ; and they do not appear as if they had been inclined by violence . A high inclination is common to these beds in Mexico , Peru , and in some of the Italian islands ( See Phillips “ Mineralogy ” for the Italian Islands page 136 . For Mexico and Peru see Humboldt “ Essai Geognostique. ” Mr. Edwards also describes the high inclination of the obsidian rocks of the Cerro del Navaja in Mexico in the “ Proc . of the Geolog . Soc. ” June 1838 . ) : on the other hand , in Hungary , the layers are horizontal ; the laminae , also , of some of the lava-streams above referred to , as far as I can understand the descriptions given of them , appear to be highly inclined or vertical . I doubt whether in any of these cases , the laminae have been tilted into their present position ; and in some instances , as in that of the trachyte described by Mr. Scrope , it is almost certain that they have been originally formed with a high inclination . In many of these cases , there is evidence that the mass of liquified rock has moved in the direction of the laminae . At Ascension , many of the air-cells have a drawn out appearance , and are crossed by coarse semi-glassy fibres , in the direction of the laminae ; and some of the layers , separating the sphaerulitic globules , have a scored appearance , as if produced by the grating of the globules . I have seen a specimen of zoned obsidian from Mexico , in Mr. Stokes ’ collection , with the surfaces of the best-defined layers streaked or furrowed with parallel lines ; and these lines or streaks precisely resembled those , produced on the surface of a mass of artificial glass by its having been poured out of a vessel . Humboldt , also , has described little cavities , which he compares to the tails of comets , behind sphaerulites in laminated obsidian rocks from Mexico , and Mr. Scrope has described other cavities behind fragments embedded in his laminated trachyte , and which he supposes to have been produced during the movement of the mass . ( “ Geological Transactions ” volume 2 second series page 200 etc . These embedded fragments , in some instances , consist of the laminated trachyte broken off and “ enveloped in those parts , which still remained liquid. ” Beudant , also , frequently refers in his great work on “ Hungary ” tome 3 page 386 , to trachytic rocks , irregularly spotted with fragments of the same varieties , which in other parts form the parallel ribbons . In these cases , we must suppose , that after part of the molten mass had assumed a laminated structure , a fresh irruption of lava broke up the mass , and involved fragments , and that subsequently the whole became relaminated . ) From such facts , most authors have attributed the lamination of these volcanic rocks to their movement whilst liquified . Although it is easy to perceive , why each separate air-cell , or each fibre in pumice-stone ( Dolomieu “ Voyage ” page 64 . ) , should be drawn out in the direction of the moving mass ; it is by no means at first obvious why such air-cells and fibres should be arranged by the movement , in the same planes , in laminae absolutely straight and parallel to each other , and often of extreme tenuity ; and still less obvious is it , why such layers should come to be of slightly different composition and of different textures . In endeavouring to make out the cause of the lamination of these igneous feldspathic rocks , let us return to the facts so minutely described at Ascension . We there see , that some of the thinnest layers are chiefly formed by numerous , exceedingly minute , though perfect , crystals of different minerals ; that other layers are formed by the union of different kinds of concretionary globules , and that the layers thus formed , often can not be distinguished from the ordinary feldspathic and pitchstone layers , composing a large portion of the entire mass . The fibrous radiating structure of the sphaerulites seems , judging from many analogous cases , to connect the concretionary and crystalline forces : the separate crystals , also , of feldspar all lie in the same parallel planes . ( The formation , indeed , of a large crystal of any mineral in a rock of mixed composition implies an aggregation of the requisite atoms , allied to concretionary action . The cause of the crystals of feldspar in these rocks of Ascension , being all placed lengthways , is probably the same with that which elongates and flattens all the brown sphaerulitic globules ( which behave like feldspar under the blowpipe ) in this same direction . ) These allied forces , therefore , have played an important part in the lamination of the mass , but they can not be considered the primary force ; for the several kinds of nodules , both the smallest and largest , are internally zoned with excessively fine shades of colour , parallel to the lamination of the whole ; and many of them are , also , externally marked in the same direction with parallel ridges and furrows , which have not been produced by weathering . Some of the finest streaks of colour in the stony layers , alternating with the obsidian , can be distinctly seen to be due to an incipient crystallisation of the constituent minerals . The extent to which the minerals have crystallised can , also , be distinctly seen to be connected with the greater or less size , and with the number , of the minute , flattened , crenulated air-cavities or fissures . Numerous facts , as in the case of geodes , and of cavities in silicified wood , in primary rocks , and in veins , show that crystallisation is much favoured by space . Hence , I conclude , that , if in a mass of cooling volcanic rock , any cause produced in parallel planes a number of minute fissures or zones of less tension ( which from the pent-up vapours would often be expanded into crenulated air-cavities ) , the crystallisation of the constituent parts , and probably the formation of concretions , would be superinduced or much favoured in such planes ; and thus , a laminated structure of the kind we are here considering would be generated . That some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in volcanic rocks , during their consolidation , we must admit in the case of the thin alternate layers of obsidian and pumice described by Humboldt , and of the small , flattened , crenulated air-cells in the laminated rocks of Ascension ; for on no other principle can we conceive why the confined vapours should through their expansion form air-cells or fibres in separate , parallel planes , instead of irregularly throughout the mass . In Mr. Stokes ’ collection , I have seen a beautiful example of this structure , in a specimen of obsidian from Mexico , which is shaded and zoned , like the finest agate , with numerous , straight , parallel layers , more or less opaque and white , or almost perfectly glassy ; the degree of opacity and glassiness depending on the number of microscopically minute , flattened air-cells ; in this case , it is scarcely possible to doubt but that the mass , to which the fragment belonged , must have been subjected to some , probably prolonged , action , causing the tension slightly to vary in the successive planes . Several causes appear capable of producing zones of different tension , in masses semi-liquified by heat . In a fragment of devitrified glass , I have observed layers of sphaerulites which appeared , from the manner in which they were abruptly bent , to have been produced by the simple contraction of the mass in the vessel , in which it cooled . In certain dikes on Mount Etna , described by M. Elie de Beaumont ( “ Mem . pour servir ” etc . tome 4 page 131 . ) , as bordered by alternating bands of scoriaceous and compact rock , one is led to suppose that the stretching movement of the surrounding strata , which originally produced the fissures , continued whilst the injected rock remained fluid . Guided , however , by Professor Forbes ’ ( “ Edinburgh New Phil . Journal ” 1842 page 350 . ) clear description of the zoned structure of glacier-ice , far the most probable explanation of the laminated structure of these feldspathic rocks appears to be , that they have been stretched whilst slowly flowing onwards in a pasty condition ( I presume that this is nearly the same explanation which Mr. Scrope had in his mind , when he speaks ( “ Geolog . Transact. ” volume 2 second series page 228 ) of the ribboned structure of his trachytic rocks , having arisen , from “ a linear extension of the mass , while in a state of imperfect liquidity , coupled with a",Volcanic Islands

A Foggy Night and Morning—Conclusion Notes PREFACE In reprinting this story for a new edition I am reminded that it was in the chapters of “ Far from the Madding Crowd , ” as they appeared month by month in a popular magazine , that I first ventured to adopt the word “ Wessex ” from the pages of early English history , and give it a fictitious significance as the existing name of the district once included in that extinct kingdom . The series of novels I projected being mainly of the kind called local , they seemed to require a territorial definition of some sort to lend unity to their scene . Finding that the area of a single county did not afford a canvas large enough for this purpose , and that there were objections to an invented name , I disinterred the old one . The press and the public were kind enough to welcome the fanciful plan , and willingly joined me in the anachronism of imagining a Wessex population living under Queen Victoria ; —a modern Wessex of railways , the penny post , mowing and reaping machines , union workhouses , lucifer matches , labourers who could read and write , and National school children . But I believe I am correct in stating that , until the existence of this contemporaneous Wessex was announced in the present story , in 1874 , it had never been heard of , and that the expression , “ a Wessex peasant , ” or “ a Wessex custom , ” would theretofore have been taken to refer to nothing later in date than the Norman Conquest . I did not anticipate that this application of the word to a modern use would extend outside the chapters of my own chronicles . But the name was soon taken up elsewhere as a local designation . The first to do so was the now defunct _Examiner_ , which , in the impression bearing date July 15 , 1876 , entitled one of its articles “ The Wessex Labourer , ” the article turning out to be no dissertation on farming during the Heptarchy , but on the modern peasant of the south-west counties , and his presentation in these stories . Since then the appellation which I had thought to reserve to the horizons and landscapes of a merely realistic dream-country , has become more and more popular as a practical definition ; and the dream-country has , by degrees , solidified into a utilitarian region which people can go to , take a house in , and write to the papers from . But I ask all good and gentle readers to be so kind as to forget this , and to refuse steadfastly to believe that there are any inhabitants of a Victorian Wessex outside the pages of this and the companion volumes in which they were first discovered . Moreover , the village called Weatherbury , wherein the scenes of the present story of the series are for the most part laid , would perhaps be hardly discernible by the explorer , without help , in any existing place nowadays ; though at the time , comparatively recent , at which the tale was written , a sufficient reality to meet the descriptions , both of backgrounds and personages , might have been traced easily enough . The church remains , by great good fortune , unrestored and intact , and a few of the old houses ; but the ancient malt-house , which was formerly so characteristic of the parish , has been pulled down these twenty years ; also most of the thatched and dormered cottages that were once lifeholds . The game of prisoner ’ s base , which not so long ago seemed to enjoy a perennial vitality in front of the worn-out stocks , may , so far as I can say , be entirely unknown to the rising generation of schoolboys there . The practice of divination by Bible and key , the regarding of valentines as things of serious import , the shearing-supper , and the harvest-home , have , too , nearly disappeared in the wake of the old houses ; and with them have gone , it is said , much of that love of fuddling to which the village at one time was notoriously prone . The change at the root of this has been the recent supplanting of the class of stationary cottagers , who carried on the local traditions and humours , by a population of more or less migratory labourers , which has led to a break of continuity in local history , more fatal than any other thing to the preservation of legend , folk-lore , close inter-social relations , and eccentric individualities . For these the indispensable conditions of existence are attachment to the soil of one particular spot by generation after generation . T. H. February 1895 CHAPTER I Description of Farmer Oak—An Incident When Farmer Oak smiled , the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears , his eyes were reduced to chinks , and diverging wrinkles appeared round them , extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun . His Christian name was Gabriel , and on working days he was a young man of sound judgment , easy motions , proper dress , and general good character . On Sundays he was a man of misty views , rather given to postponing , and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella : upon the whole , one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the parish and the drunken section , —that is , he went to church , but yawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene creed , and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening to the sermon . Or , to state his character as it stood in the scale of public opinion , when his friends and critics were in tantrums , he was considered rather a bad man ; when they were pleased , he was rather a good man ; when they were neither , he was a man whose moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture . Since he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays , Oak ’ s appearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own—the mental picture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in that way . He wore a low-crowned felt hat , spread out at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds , and a coat like Dr. Johnson ’ s ; his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large , affording to each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day long and know nothing of damp—their maker being a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity . Mr. Oak carried about him , by way of watch , what may be called a small silver clock ; in other words , it was a watch as to shape and intention , and a small clock as to size . This instrument being several years older than Oak ’ s grandfather , had the peculiarity of going either too fast or not at all . The smaller of its hands , too , occasionally slipped round on the pivot , and thus , though the minutes were told with precision , nobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to . The stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes , and he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars , and by pressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours ’ windows , till he could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within . It may be mentioned that Oak ’ s fob being difficult of access , by reason of its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers ( which also lay at a remote height under his waistcoat ) , the watch was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side , compressing the mouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion required , and drawing up the watch by its chain , like a bucket from a well . But some thoughtful persons , who had seen him walking across one of his fields on a certain December morning—sunny and exceedingly mild—might have regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these . In his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on to manhood : there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy . His height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his presence imposing , had they been exhibited with due consideration . But there is a way some men have , rural and urban alike , for which the mind is more responsible than flesh and sinew : it is a way of curtailing their dimensions by their manner of showing them . And from a quiet modesty that would have become a vestal , which seemed continually to impress upon him that he had no great claim on the world ’ s room , Oak walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend , yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders . This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well , which Oak did not . He had just reached the time of life at which “ young ” is ceasing to be the prefix of “ man ” in speaking of one . He was at the brightest period of masculine growth , for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated : he had passed the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse , and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again , in the character of prejudice , by the influence of a wife and family . In short , he was twenty-eight , and a bachelor . The field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe Hill . Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk-Newton . Casually glancing over the hedge , Oak saw coming down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon , painted yellow and gaily marked , drawn by two horses , a waggoner walking alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly . The waggon was laden with household goods and window plants , and on the apex of the whole sat a woman , young and attractive . Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a minute , when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his eyes . “ The tailboard of the waggon is gone , Miss , ” said the waggoner . “ Then I heard it fall , ” said the girl , in a soft , though not particularly low voice . “ I heard a noise I could not account for when we were coming up the hill. ” “ I ’ ll run back. ” “ Do , ” she answered . The sensible horses stood—perfectly still , and the waggoner ’ s steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance . The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless , surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards , backed by an oak settle , and ornamented in front by pots of geraniums , myrtles , and cactuses , together with a caged canary—all probably from the windows of the house just vacated . There was also a cat in a willow basket , from the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes , and affectionately surveyed the small birds around . The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place , and the only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up and down the perches of its prison . Then she looked attentively downwards . It was not at the bird , nor at the cat ; it was at an oblong package tied in paper , and lying between them . She turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming . He was not yet in sight ; and her eyes crept back to the package , her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it . At length she drew the article into her lap , and untied the paper covering ; a small swing looking-glass was disclosed , in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively . She parted her lips and smiled . It was a fine morning , and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore , and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair . The myrtles , geraniums , and cactuses packed around her were fresh and green , and at such a leafless season they invested the whole concern of horses , waggon , furniture , and girl with a peculiar vernal charm . What possessed her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the sparrows , blackbirds , and unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators , —whether the smile began as a factitious one , to test her capacity in that art , —nobody knows ; it ended certainly in a real smile . She blushed at herself , and seeing her reflection blush , blushed the more . The change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an act—from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors—lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess . The picture was a delicate one . Woman ’ s prescriptive infirmity had stalked into the sunlight , which had clothed it in the freshness of an originality . A cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene , generous though he fain would have been . There was no necessity whatever for her looking in the glass . She did not adjust her hat , or pat her hair , or press a dimple into shape , or do one thing to signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the glass . She simply observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind , her thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which men would play a part—vistas of probable triumphs—the smiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won . Still , this was but conjecture , and the whole series of actions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any part in them at all . The waggoner ’ s steps were heard returning . She put the glass in the paper , and the whole again into its place . When the waggon had passed on , Gabriel withdrew from his point of espial , and descending into the road , followed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill , where the object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll . About twenty steps still remained between him and the gate , when he heard a dispute . It was a difference concerning twopence between the persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar . “ Mis ’ ess ’ s niece is upon the top of the things , and she says that ’ s enough that I ’ ve offered ye , you great miser , and she won ’ t pay any more. ” These were the waggoner ’ s words . “ Very well ; then mis ’ ess ’ s niece can ’ t pass , ” said the turnpike-keeper , closing the gate . Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants , and fell into a reverie . There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably insignificant . Threepence had a definite value as money—it was an appreciable infringement on a day ’ s wages , and , as such , a higgling matter ; but twopence— “ Here , ” he said , stepping forward and handing twopence to the gatekeeper ; “ let the young woman pass. ” He looked up at her then ; she heard his words , and looked down . Gabriel ’ s features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot , as represented in a window of the church he attended , that not a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of distinction or notoriety . The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden seemed to think so too , for she carelessly glanced over him , and told her man to drive on . She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute scale , but she did not speak them ; more probably she felt none , for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point , and we know how women take a favour of that kind . The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle . “ That ’ s a handsome maid , ” he said to Oak . “ But she has her faults , ” said Gabriel . “ True , farmer. ” “ And the greatest of them is—well , what it is always. ” “ Beating people down ? A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of a few days earlier . Norcombe Hill—not far from lonely Toller-Down—was one of the spots which suggest to a passer-by that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth . It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil—an ordinary specimen of those smoothly-outlined protuberances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on some great day of confusion , when far grander heights and dizzy granite precipices topple down . The hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying plantation of beeches , whose upper verge formed a line over the crest , fringing its arched curve against the sky , like a mane . To-night these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest blasts , which smote the wood and floundered through it with a sound as of grumbling , or gushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened moan . The dry leaves in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes , a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few , and sending them spinning across the grass . A group or two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude had remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks with smart taps . Between this half-wooded half-naked hill , and the vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly commanded , was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade—the sounds from which suggested that what it concealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here . The thin grasses , more or less coating the hill , were touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers , and almost of differing natures—one rubbing the blades heavily , another raking them piercingly , another brushing them like a soft broom . The instinctive act of humankind was to stand and listen , and learn how the trees on the right and the trees on the left wailed or chaunted to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral choir ; how hedges and other shapes to leeward then caught the note , lowering it to the tenderest sob ; and how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south , to be heard no more . The sky was clear—remarkably clear—and the twinkling of all the stars seemed to be but throbs of one body , timed by a common pulse . The North Star was directly in the wind ’ s eye , and since evening the Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east , till he was now at a right angle with the meridian . A difference of colour in the stars—oftener read of than seen in England—was really perceptible here . The sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely glitter , the star called Capella was yellow , Aldebaran and Betelgueux shone with a fiery red . To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as this , the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement . The sensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly objects , which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness , or by the better outlook upon space that a hill affords , or by the wind , or by the solitude ; but whatever be its origin , the impression of riding along is vivid and abiding . The poetry of motion is a phrase much in use , and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night , and , having first expanded with a sense of difference from the mass of civilised mankind , who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at this time , long and quietly watch your stately progress through the stars . After such a nocturnal reconnoitre it is hard to get back to earth , and to believe that the consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from a tiny human frame . Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to be heard in this place up against the sky . They had a clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind , and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in nature . They were the notes of Farmer Oak ’ s flute . The tune was not floating unhindered into the open air : it seemed muffled in some way , and was altogether too curtailed in power to spread high or wide . It came from the direction of a small dark object under the plantation hedge—a shepherd ’ s hut—now presenting an outline to which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled to attach either meaning or use . The image as a whole was that of a small Noah ’ s Ark on a small Ararat , allowing the traditionary outlines and general form of the Ark which are followed by toy-makers—and by these means are established in men ’ s imaginations among their firmest , because earliest impressions—to pass as an approximate pattern . The hut stood on little wheels , which raised its floor about a foot from the ground . Such shepherds ’ huts are dragged into the fields when the lambing season comes on , to shelter the shepherd in his enforced nightly attendance . It was only latterly that people had begun to call Gabriel “ Farmer ” Oak . During the twelvemonth preceding this time he had been enabled by sustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the small sheep-farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion , and stock it with two hundred sheep . Previously he had been a bailiff for a short time , and earlier still a shepherd only , having from his childhood assisted his father in tending the flocks of large proprietors , till old Gabriel sank to rest . This venture , unaided and alone , into the paths of farming as master and not as man , with an advance of sheep not yet paid for , was a critical juncture with Gabriel Oak , and he recognised his position clearly . The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of his ewes , and sheep having been his speciality from his youth , he wisely refrained from deputing the task of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice . The wind continued to beat about the corners of the hut , but the flute-playing ceased . A rectangular space of light appeared in the side of the hut , and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak ’ s figure . He carried a lantern in his hand , and closing the door behind him , came forward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly twenty minutes , the lantern light appearing and disappearing here and there , and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or behind it . Oak ’ s motions , though they had a quiet energy , were slow , and their deliberateness accorded well with his occupation . Fitness being the basis of beauty , nobody could have denied that his steady swings and turns in and about the flock had elements of grace . Yet , although if occasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a dash as can the men of towns who are more to the manner born , his special power , morally , physically , and mentally , was static , owing little or nothing to momentum as a rule . A close examination of the ground hereabout , even by the wan starlight only , revealed how a portion of what would have been casually called a wild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose this winter . Detached hurdles thatched with straw were stuck into the ground at various scattered points , amid and under which the whitish forms of his meek ewes moved and rustled . The ring of the sheep-bell , which had been silent during his absence , recommenced , in tones that had more mellowness than clearness , owing to an increasing growth of surrounding wool . This continued till Oak withdrew again from the flock . He returned to the hut , bringing in his arms a new-born lamb , consisting of four legs large enough for a full-grown sheep , united by a seemingly inconsiderable membrane about half the substance of the legs collectively , which constituted the animal ’ s entire body just at present . The little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small stove , where a can of milk was simmering . Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it and then pinching the snuff , the cot being lighted by a candle suspended by a twisted wire . A rather hard couch , formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly down , covered half the floor of this little habitation , and here the young man stretched himself along , loosened his woollen cravat , and closed his eyes . In about the time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have decided upon which side to lie , Farmer Oak was asleep . The inside of the hut , as it now presented itself , was cosy and alluring , and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle , reflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach , flung associations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools . In the corner stood the sheep-crook , and along a shelf at one side were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to ovine surgery and physic ; spirits of wine , turpentine , tar , magnesia , ginger , and castor-oil being the chief . On a triangular shelf across the corner stood bread , bacon , cheese , and a cup for ale or cider , which was supplied from a flagon beneath . Beside the provisions lay the flute , whose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious hour . The house was ventilated by two round holes , like the lights of a ship ’ s cabin , with wood slides . The lamb , revived by the warmth , began to bleat , and the sound entered Gabriel ’ s ears and brain with an instant meaning , as expected sounds will . Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse operation , he looked at his watch , found that the hour-hand had shifted again , put on his hat , took the lamb in his arms , and carried it into the darkness . After placing the little creature with its mother , he stood and carefully examined the sky , to ascertain the time of night from the altitudes of the stars . The Dog-star and Aldebaran , pointing to the restless Pleiades , were half-way up the Southern sky , and between them hung Orion , which gorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now , as it soared forth above the rim of the landscape . Castor and Pollux with their quiet shine were almost on the meridian : the barren and gloomy Square of Pegasus was creeping round to the north-west ; far away through the plantation Vega sparkled like a lamp suspended amid the leafless trees , and Cassiopeia ’ s chair stood daintily poised on the uppermost boughs . “ One o ’ clock , ” said Gabriel . Being a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some charm in this life he led , he stood still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument , and regarded it in an appreciative spirit , as a work of art superlatively beautiful . For a moment he seemed impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene , or rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man . Human shapes , interferences , troubles , and joys were all as if they were not , and there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself ; he could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side . Occupied thus , with eyes stretched afar , Oak gradually perceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing . It was an artificial light , almost close at hand . To find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable and expected makes some people fearful ; but a case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when intuition , sensation , memory , analogy , testimony , probability , induction—every kind of evidence in the logician ’ s list—have united to persuade consciousness that it is quite in isolation . Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower boughs to the windy side . A dim mass under the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here , the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill , so that at its back part the roof was almost level with the ground . In front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with tar as a preservative . Through crevices in the roof and side spread streaks and dots of light , a combination of which made the radiance that had attracted him . Oak stepped up behind , where , leaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole , he could see into the interior clearly . The place contained two women and two cows . By the side of the latter a steaming bran-mash stood in a bucket . One of the women was past middle age . Her companion was apparently young and graceful ; he could form no decided opinion upon her looks , her position being almost beneath his eye , so that he saw her in a bird ’ s-eye view , as Milton ’ s Satan first saw Paradise . She wore no bonnet or hat , but had enveloped herself in a large cloak , which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering . “ There , now we ’ ll go home , ” said the elder of the two , resting her knuckles upon her hips , and looking at their goings-on as a whole . “ I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now . I have never been more frightened in my life , but I don ’ t mind breaking my rest if she recovers. ” The young woman , whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall together on the smallest provocation of silence , yawned without parting her lips to any inconvenient extent , whereupon Gabriel caught the infection and slightly yawned in sympathy . “ I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things , ” she said . “ As we are not , we must do them ourselves , ” said the other ; “ for you must help me if you stay. ” “ Well , my hat is gone , however , ” continued the younger . “ It went over the hedge , I think . The idea of such a slight wind catching it. ” The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed , and was encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red , as absolutely uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour , her long back being mathematically level . The other was spotted , grey and white . Beside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old , looking idiotically at the two women , which showed that it had not long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight , and often turning to the lantern , which it apparently mistook for the moon , inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience . Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe Hill lately . “ I think we had better send for some oatmeal , ” said the elder woman ; “ there ’ s no more bran. ” “ Yes , aunt ; and I ’ ll ride over for it as soon as it is light. ” “ But there ’ s no side-saddle. ” “ I can ride on the other : trust me. ” Oak , upon hearing these remarks , became more curious to observe her features , but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak , and by his aërial position , he felt himself drawing upon his fancy for their details . In making even horizontal and clear inspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us whatever our eyes bring in . Had Gabriel been able from the first to get a distinct view of her countenance , his estimate of it as very handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one . Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him , his position moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy , he painted her a beauty . By one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature , like a busy mother , seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn and make her children smile , the girl now dropped the cloak , and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket . Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon , myrtles , and looking-glass : prosily , as the woman who owed him twopence . They placed the calf beside its mother again , took up the lantern , and went out , the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula . Gabriel Oak returned to his flock . CHAPTER III A GIRL ON HORSEBACK—CONVERSATION The sluggish day began to break . Even its position terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest , and for no particular reason save that the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again into the plantation . Lingering and musing here , he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill , and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on its back , ascending by the path leading past the cattle-shed . She was the young woman of the night before . Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind ; possibly she had come to look for it . He hastily scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among the leaves . Gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut . Here he ensconced himself , and peeped through the loophole in the direction of the rider ’ s approach . She came up and looked around—then on the other side of the hedge . Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an unexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for the present . The path , after passing the cowshed , bisected the plantation . It was not a bridle-path—merely a pedestrian ’ s track , and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground , which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them . The girl , who wore no riding-habit , looked around for a moment , as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view , then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony ’ s back , her head over its tail , her feet against its shoulders , and her eyes to the sky . The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher—its noiselessness that of a hawk . Gabriel ’ s eyes had scarcely been able to follow her . The tall lank pony seemed used to such doings , and ambled along unconcerned . Thus she passed under the level boughs . The performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse ’ s head and its tail , and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the passage of the plantation , she began to adopt another , even more obviously convenient than the first . She had no side-saddle , and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways . Springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling , and satisfying herself that nobody was in sight , she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle , though hardly expected of the woman , and trotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill . Oak was amused , perhaps a little astonished , and hanging up the hat in his hut , went again among his ewes . An hour passed , the girl returned , properly seated now , with a bag of bran in front of her . On nearing the cattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking-pail , who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off . The boy led away the horse , leaving the pail with the young woman . Soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular succession from within the shed , the obvious sounds of a person milking a cow . Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand , and waited beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill . She came , the pail in one hand , hanging against her knee . The left arm was extended as a balance , enough of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event had happened in the summer , when the whole would have been revealed . There was a bright air and manner about her now , by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could not be questioned ; and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive because a beholder felt it to be , upon the whole , true . Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius , that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power . It was with some surprise that she saw Gabriel ’ s face rising like the moon behind the hedge . The adjustment of the farmer ’ s hazy conceptions of her charms to the portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution than a difference . The starting-point selected by the judgment was her height . She seemed tall , but the pail was a small one , and the hedge diminutive ; hence , making allowance for error by comparison with these , she could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best . All features of consequence were severe and regular . It may have been observed by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty , that in Englishwoman a classically-formed face is seldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern , the highly-finished features being generally too large for the remainder of the frame ; that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves . Without throwing a Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid , let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out of place , and looked at her proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure . From the contours of her figure in its upper part , she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders ; but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them . Had she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush . Yet she was not a shy girl by any means ; it was merely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do it in towns . That the girl ’ s thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she caught Oak ’ s eyes conning the same page was natural , and almost certain . The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little more pronounced , dignity if a little less . Rays of male vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts ; she brushed hers with her hand , as if Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual touch , and the free air of her previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself . Yet it was the man who blushed , the maid not at all . “ I found a hat , ” said Oak . “ It is mine , ” said she , and , from a sense of proportion , kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh distinctly : “ it flew away last night. ” “ One o ’ clock this morning ? ” “ Well—it was. ” She was surprised . “ How did you know ? ” she said . “ I was here. ” “ You are Farmer Oak , are you not ? ” “ That or thereabouts . I ’ m lately come to this place. ” “ A large farm ? ” she inquired , casting her eyes round , and swinging back her hair , which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass ; but it being now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves with a colour of their own . “ No ; not large . About a hundred. ” ( In speaking of farms the word “ acres ” is omitted by the natives , by analogy to such old expressions as “ a stag of ten. ” ) “ I wanted my hat this morning , ” she went on . “ I had to ride to Tewnell Mill. ” “ Yes you had. ” “ How do you know ? ” “ I saw you. ” “ Where ? ” she inquired , a misgiving bringing every muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill . “ Here—going through the plantation , and all down the hill , ” said Farmer Oak , with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in his mind , as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named , and then turned back to meet his colloquist ’ s eyes . A perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a theft . Recollection of the strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was succeeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation , and that by a hot face . It was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule ; not a point in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose-colour . From the Maiden ’ s Blush , through all varieties of the Provence down to the Crimson Tuscany , the countenance of Oak ’ s acquaintance quickly graduated ; whereupon he , in considerateness , turned away his head . The sympathetic man still looked the other way , and wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again . He heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze , and looked . She had gone away . With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to his work . Five mornings and evenings passed . The young woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one , but never allowed her vision to stray in the direction of Oak ’ s person . His want of tact had deeply offended her—not by seeing what he could not help , but by letting her know that he had seen it . For , as without law there is no sin , without eyes there is no indecorum ; and she appeared to feel that Gabriel ’ s espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own connivance . It was food for great regret with him ; it was also a _contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction . The acquaintanceship might , however , have ended in a slow forgetting , but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week . One afternoon it began to freeze , and the frost increased with evening , which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds . It was a time when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets ; when round the drawing-room fire of a thick-walled mansion the sitters ’ backs are cold , even whilst their faces are all aglow . Many a small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs . As the milking-hour drew near , Oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed . At last he felt cold , and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove . The wind came in at the bottom of the door , and to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south . Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole—of which there was one on each side of the hut . Gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept open—that chosen being always on the side away from the wind . Closing the slide to windward , he turned to open the other ; on second thoughts the farmer considered that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two , till the temperature of the hut was a little raised . He sat down . His head began to ache in an unwonted manner , and , fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights , Oak decided to get up , open the slide , and then allow himself to fall asleep . He fell asleep , however , without having performed the necessary preliminary . How long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew . During the first stages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment . His dog was howling , his head was aching fearfully—somebody was pulling him about , hands were loosening his neckerchief . On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness . The young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him . More than this—astonishingly more—his head was upon her lap , his face and neck were disagreeably wet , and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar . “ Whatever is the matter ? ” said Oak , vacantly . She seemed to experience mirth , but of too insignificant a kind to start enjoyment . “ Nothing now , ” she answered , “ since you are not dead . It is a wonder you were not suffocated in this hut of yours. ” “ Ah , the hut ! ” murmured Gabriel . “ I gave ten pounds for that hut . But I ’ ll sell it , and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times , and curl up to sleep in a lock of straw ! It played me nearly the same trick the other day ! ” Gabriel , by way of emphasis , brought down his fist upon the floor . “ It was not exactly the fault of the hut , ” she observed in a tone which showed her to be that novelty among women—one who finished a thought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it . “ You should , I think , have considered , and not have been so foolish as to leave the slides closed. ” “ Yes I suppose I should , ” said Oak , absently . He was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her , his head upon her dress , before the event passed on into the heap of bygone things . He wished she knew his impressions ; but he would as soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language . So he remained silent . She made him sit up , and then Oak began wiping his face and shaking himself like a Samson . “ How can I thank ’ ee ? ” he said at last , gratefully , some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face . “ Oh , never mind that , ” said the girl , smiling , and allowing her smile to hold good for Gabriel ’ s next remark , whatever that might prove to be . “ How did you find me ? ” “ I heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when I came to the milking ( it was so lucky , Daisy ’ s milking is almost over for the season , and I shall not come here after this week or the next ) . The dog saw me , and jumped over to me , and laid hold of my skirt . I came across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the slides were closed . My uncle has a hut like this one , and I have heard him tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open . I opened the door , and there you were like dead . I threw the milk over you , as there was no water , forgetting it was warm , and no use. ” “ I wonder if I should have died ? ” Gabriel said , in a low voice , which was rather meant to travel back to himself than to her . “ Oh no ! ” the girl replied . She seemed to prefer a less tragic probability ; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of such a deed—and she shunned it . “ I believe you saved my life , Miss—I don ’ t know your name . I know your aunt ’ s , but not yours. ” “ I would just as soon not tell it—rather not . There is no reason either why I should , as you probably will never have much to do with me. ” “ Still , I should like to know. ” “ You can inquire at my aunt ’ s—she will tell you. ” “ My name is Gabriel Oak. ” “ And mine isn ’ t . You seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively , Gabriel Oak. ” “ You see , it is the only one I shall ever have , and I must make the most of it. ” “ I always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable. ” “ I should think you might soon get a new one. ” “ Mercy ! —how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people , Gabriel Oak. ” “ Well , Miss—excuse the words—I thought you would like them . But I can ’ t match you , I know , in mapping out my mind upon my tongue . I never was very clever in my inside . But I thank you . Come , give me your hand. ” She hesitated , somewhat disconcerted at Oak ’ s old-fashioned earnest conclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on . “ Very well , ” she said , and gave him her hand , compressing her lips to a demure impassivity . He held it but an instant , and in his fear of being too demonstrative , swerved to the opposite extreme , touching her fingers with the lightness of a small-hearted person . “ I am sorry , ” he said the instant after . “ What for ? ” “ Letting your hand go so quick. ” “ You may have it again if you like ; there it is. ” She gave him her hand again . Oak held it longer this time—indeed , curiously long . “ How soft it is—being winter time , too—not chapped or rough or anything ! ” he said . “ There—that ’ s long enough , ” said she , though without pulling it away . “ But I suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it ? You may if you want to. ” “ I wasn ’ t thinking of any such thing , ” said Gabriel , simply ; “ but I will— ” “ That you won ’ t ! ” She snatched back her hand . Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact . “ Now find out my name , ” she said , teasingly ; and withdrew . CHAPTER IV GABRIEL ’ S RESOLVE—THE VISIT—THE MISTAKE The only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is , as a rule , that of the unconscious kind ; but a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the subordinated man . This well-favoured and comely girl soon made appreciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young Farmer Oak . Love , being an extremely exacting usurer ( a sense of exorbitant profit , spiritually , by an exchange of hearts , being at the bottom of pure passions , as that of exorbitant profit , bodily or materially , is at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere ) , every morning Oak ’ s feelings were as sensitive as the money-market in calculations upon his chances . His dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which Oak waited for the girl ’ s presence , that the farmer was quite struck with the resemblance , felt it lowering , and would not look at the dog . However , he continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming , and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself . Oak had nothing finished and ready to say as yet , and not being able to frame love phrases which end where they begin ; passionate tales— —Full of sound and fury , —Signifying nothing— he said no word at all . By making inquiries he found that the girl ’ s name was Bathsheba Everdene , and that the cow would go dry in about seven days . He dreaded the eighth day . At last the eighth day came . The cow had ceased to give milk for that year , and Bathsheba Everdene came up the hill no more . Gabriel had reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short time before . He liked saying “ Bathsheba ” as a private enjoyment instead of whistling ; turned over his taste to black hair , though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy , isolated himself till the space he filled in the public eye was contemptibly small . Love is a possible strength in an actual weakness . Marriage transforms a distraction into a support , the power of which should be , and happily often is , in direct proportion to the degree of imbecility it supplants . Oak began now to see light in this direction , and said to himself , “ I ’ ll make her my wife , or upon my soul I shall be good for nothing ! ” All this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba ’ s aunt . He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe , mother of a living lamb . On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution—a fine January morning , when there was just enough blue sky visible to make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more , and an occasional gleam of silvery sunshine , Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday basket , and stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst , the aunt—George , the dog walking behind , with a countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking . Gabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with strange meditation . At evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin—seen the hearth and Bathsheba beside it—beside it in her out-door dress ; for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection ; they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bathsheba Everdene . He had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind—of a nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly ornate—of a degree between fine-market-day and wet-Sunday selection . He thoroughly cleaned his silver watch-chain with whiting , put new lacing straps to his boots , looked to the brass eyelet-holes , went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick , and trimmed it vigorously on his way back ; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box , put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either , and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry , sandy , and inextricably curly hair , till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour , between that of guano and Roman cement , making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg , or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb . Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves ; one might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of those under them . It seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one , for , as the rather untoward commencement of Oak ’ s overtures , just as he arrived by the garden gate , he saw a cat inside , going into various arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George . The dog took no notice , for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath—in fact , he never barked even at the sheep except to order , when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance , as a sort of Commination-service , which , though offensive , had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good . A voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into which the cat had run : “ Poor dear ! Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it ; —did he , poor dear ! ” “ I beg your pardon , ” said Oak to the voice , “ but George was walking on behind me with a temper as mild as milk. ” Almost before he had ceased speaking , Oak was seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer . Nobody appeared , and he heard the person retreat among the bushes . Gabriel meditated , and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of reverie . Where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better , any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure . Oak went up to the door a little abashed : his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening . Bathsheba ’ s aunt was indoors . “ Will you tell Miss Everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to her ? ” said Mr. Oak . ( Calling one ’ s self merely Somebody , without giving a name , is not to be taken as an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world : it springs from a refined modesty , of which townspeople , with their cards and announcements , have no notion whatever . ) Bathsheba was out . The voice had evidently been hers . “ Will you come in , Mr. Oak ? ” “ Oh , thank ’ ee , ” said Gabriel , following her to the fireplace . “ I ’ ve brought a lamb for Miss Everdene . I thought she might like one to rear ; girls do. ” “ She might , ” said Mrs. Hurst , musingly ; “ though she ’ s only a visitor here . If you will wait a minute , Bathsheba will be in. ” “ Yes , I will wait , ” said Gabriel , sitting down . “ The lamb isn ’ t really the business I came about , Mrs. Hurst . In short , I was going to ask her if she ’ d like to be married. ” “ And were you indeed ? ” “ Yes . Because if she would , I should be very glad to marry her . D ’ ye know if she ’ s got any other young man hanging about her at all ? ” “ Let me think , ” said Mrs. Hurst , poking the fire superfluously .... “ Yes—bless you , ever so many young men . You see , Farmer Oak , she ’ s so good-looking , and an excellent scholar besides—she was going to be a governess once , you know , only she was too wild . Not that her young men ever come here—but , Lord , in the nature of women , she must have a dozen ! ” “ That ’ s unfortunate , ” said Farmer Oak , contemplating a crack in the stone floor with sorrow . “ I ’ m only an every-day sort of man , and my only chance was in being the first comer .... Well , there ’ s no use in my waiting , for that was all I came about : so I ’ ll take myself off home-along , Mrs. Hurst. ” When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down , he heard a “ hoi-hoi ! ” uttered behind him , in a piping note of more treble quality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when shouted across a field . He looked round , and saw a girl racing after him , waving a white handkerchief . Oak stood still—and the runner drew nearer . It was Bathsheba Everdene . Gabriel ’ s colour deepened : hers was already deep , not , as it appeared , from emotion , but from running . “ Farmer Oak—I— ” she said , pausing for want of breath pulling up in front of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side . “ I have just called to see you , ” said Gabriel , pending her further speech . “ Yes—I know that , ” she said panting like a robin , her face red and moist from her exertions , like a peony petal before the sun dries off the dew . “ I didn ’ t know you had come to ask to have me , or I should have come in from the garden instantly . I ran after you to say—that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me— ” Gabriel expanded . “ I ’ m sorry to have made you run so fast , my dear , ” he said , with a grateful sense of favours to come . “ Wait a bit till you ’ ve found your breath. ” “ —It was quite a mistake—aunt ’ s telling you I had a young man already , ” Bathsheba went on . “ I haven ’ t a sweetheart at all—and I never had one , and I thought that , as times go with women , it was _such_ a pity to send you away thinking that I had several. ” “ Really and truly I am glad to hear that ! ” said Farmer Oak , smiling one of his long special smiles , and blushing with gladness . He held out his hand to take hers , which , when she had eased her side by pressing it there , was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud-beating heart . Directly he seized it she put it behind her , so that it slipped through his fingers like an eel . “ I have a nice snug little farm , ” said Gabriel , with half a degree less assurance than when he had seized her hand . “ Yes ; you have. ” “ A man has advanced me money to begin with , but still , it will soon be paid off , and though I am only an every-day sort of man , I have got on a little since I was a boy. ” Gabriel uttered “ a little ” in a tone to show her that it was the complacent form of “ a great deal. ” He continued : “ When we be married , I am quite sure I can work twice as hard as I do now. ” He went forward and stretched out his arm again . Bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush , now laden with red berries . Seeing his advance take the form of an attitude threatening a possible enclosure , if not compression , of her person , she edged off round the bush . “ Why , Farmer Oak , ” she said , over the top , looking at him with rounded eyes , “ I never said I was going to marry you. ” “ Well—that _is_ a tale ! ” said Oak , with dismay . “ To run after anybody like this , and then say you don ’ t want him ! ” “ What I meant to tell you was only this , ” she said eagerly , and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for herself— “ that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart , instead of my having a dozen , as my aunt said ; I _hate_ to be thought men ’ s property in that way , though possibly I shall be had some day . Why , if I ’ d wanted you I shouldn ’ t have run after you like this ; ’ twould have been the _forwardest_ thing ! But there was no harm in hurrying to correct a piece of false news that had been told you. ” “ Oh , no—no harm at all. ” But there is such a thing as being too generous in expressing a judgment impulsively , and Oak added with a more appreciative sense of all the circumstances— “ Well , I am not quite certain it was no harm. ” “ Indeed , I hadn ’ t time to think before starting whether I wanted to marry or not , for you ’ d have been gone over the hill. ” “ Come , ” said Gabriel , freshening again ; “ think a minute or two . I ’ ll wait a while , Miss Everdene . Will you marry me ? Do , Bathsheba . I love you far more than common ! ” “ I ’ ll try to think , ” she observed , rather more timorously ; “ if I can think out of doors ; my mind spreads away so. ” “ But you can give a guess. ” “ Then give me time. ” Bathsheba looked thoughtfully into the distance , away from the direction in which Gabriel stood . “ I can make you happy , ” said he to the back of her head , across the bush . “ You shall have a piano in a year or two—farmers ’ wives are getting to have pianos now—and I ’ ll practise up the flute right well to play with you in the evenings. ” “ Yes ; I should like that. ” “ And have one of those little ten-pound gigs for market—and nice flowers , and birds—cocks and hens I mean , because they be useful , ” continued Gabriel , feeling balanced between poetry and practicality . “ I should like it very much. ” “ And a frame for cucumbers—like a gentleman and lady. ” “ Yes. ” “ And when the wedding was over , we ’ d have it put in the newspaper list of marriages. ” “ Dearly I should like that ! ” “ And the babies in the births—every man jack of ’ em ! And at home by the fire , whenever you look up , there I shall be—and whenever I look up there will be you. ” “ Wait , wait , and don ’ t be improper ! ” Her countenance fell , and she was silent awhile . He regarded the red berries between them over and over again , to such an extent , that holly seemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of marriage . Bathsheba decisively turned to him . “ No ; ’ tis no use , ” she said . “ I don ’ t want to marry you. ” “ Try. ” “ I have tried hard all the time I ’ ve been thinking ; for a marriage would be very nice in one sense . People would talk about me , and think I had won my battle , and I should feel triumphant , and all that . But a husband— ” “ Well ! ” “ Why , he ’ d always be there , as you say ; whenever I looked up , there he ’ d be. ” “ Of course he would—I , that is. ” “ Well , what I mean is that I shouldn ’ t mind being a bride at a wedding , if I could be one without having a husband . But since a woman can ’ t show off in that way by herself , I shan ’ t marry—at least yet. ” “ That ’ s a terrible wooden story ! ” At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away from him . “ Upon my heart and soul , I don ’ t know what a maid can say stupider than that , ” said Oak . “ But dearest , ” he continued in a palliative voice , “ don ’ t be like it ! ” Oak sighed a deep honest sigh—none the less so in that , being like the sigh of a pine plantation , it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmosphere . “ Why won ’ t you have me ? ” he appealed , creeping round the holly to reach her side . “ I can not , ” she said , retreating . “ But why ? ” he persisted , standing still at last in despair of ever reaching her , and facing over the bush . “ Because I don ’ t love you. ” “ Yes , but— ” She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness , so that it was hardly ill-mannered at all . “ I don ’ t love you , ” she said . “ But I love you—and , as for myself , I am content to be liked. ” “ Oh Mr. Oak—that ’ s very fine ! You ’ d get to despise me. ” “ Never , ” said Mr Oak , so earnestly that he seemed to be coming , by the force of his words , straight through the bush and into her arms . “ I shall do one thing in this life—one thing certain—that is , love you , and long for you , and _keep wanting you_ till I die. ” His voice had a genuine pathos now , and his large brown hands perceptibly trembled . “ It seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much ! ” she said with a little distress , and looking hopelessly around for some means of escape from her moral dilemma . “ How I wish I hadn ’ t run after you ! ” However she seemed to have a short cut for getting back to cheerfulness , and set her face to signify archness . “ It wouldn ’ t do , Mr. Oak . I want somebody to tame me ; I am too independent ; and you would never be able to , I know. ” Oak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying that it was useless to attempt argument . “ Mr . Oak , ” she said , with luminous distinctness and common sense , “ you are better off than I. I have hardly a penny in the world—I am staying with my aunt for my bare sustenance . I am better educated than you—and I don ’ t love you a bit : that ’ s my side of the case . Now yours : you are a farmer just beginning ; and you ought in common prudence , if you marry at all ( which you should certainly not think of doing at present ) , to marry a woman with money , who would stock a larger farm for you than you have now. ” Gabriel looked at her with a little surprise and much admiration . “ That ’ s the very thing I had been thinking myself ! ” he naïvely said . Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian characteristics too many to succeed with Bathsheba : his humility , and a superfluous moiety of honesty . Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted . “ Well , then , why did you come and disturb me ? ” she said , almost angrily , if not quite , an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek . “ I can ’ t do what I think would be—would be— ” “ Right ? ” “ No : wise. ” “ You have made an admission _now_ , Mr. Oak , ” she exclaimed , with even more hauteur , and rocking her head disdainfully . “ After that , do you think I could marry you ? Not if I know it. ” He broke in passionately . “ But don ’ t mistake me like that ! Because I am open enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought of , you make your colours come up your face , and get crabbed with me . That about your not being good enough for me is nonsense . You speak like a lady—all the parish notice it , and your uncle at Weatherbury is , I have heerd , a large farmer—much larger than ever I shall be . May I call in the evening , or will you walk along with me o ’ Sundays ? I don ’ t want you to make-up your mind at once , if you ’ d rather not. ” “ No—no—I can not . Don ’ t press me any more—don ’ t . I don ’ t love you—so ’ twould be ridiculous , ” she said , with a laugh . No man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry-go-round of skittishness . “ Very well , ” said Oak , firmly , with the bearing of one who was going to give his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever . “ Then I ’ ll ask you no more. ” CHAPTER V DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA—A PASTORAL TRAGEDY The news which one day reached Gabriel , that Bathsheba Everdene had left the neighbourhood , had an influence upon him which might have surprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the renunciation the less absolute its character . It may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting out of love as there is for getting in . Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way , but it has been known to fail . Separation , which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba ’ s disappearance , though effectual with people of certain humours , is apt to idealize the removed object with others—notably those whose affection , placid and regular as it may be , flows deep and long . Oak belonged to the even-tempered order of humanity , and felt the secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now that she was gone—that was all . His incipient friendship with her aunt had been nipped by the failure of his suit , and all that Oak learnt of Bathsheba ’ s movements was done indirectly . It appeared that she had gone to a place called Weatherbury , more than twenty miles off , but in what capacity—whether as a visitor , or permanently , he could not discover . Gabriel had two dogs . George , the elder , exhibited an ebony-tipped nose , surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh , and a coat marked in random splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty grey ; but the grey , after years of sun and rain , had been scorched and washed out of the more prominent locks , leaving them of a reddish-brown , as if the blue component of the grey had faded , like the indigo from the same kind of colour in Turner ’ s pictures . In substance it had originally been hair , but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning it by degrees into wool of a poor quality and staple . This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals and dreadful temper , and the result was that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood . Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the difference between such exclamations as “ Come in ! ” and “ D–––– ye , come in ! ” that he knew to a hair ’ s breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes ’ tails that each call involved , if a staggerer with the sheep crook was to be escaped . Though old , he was clever and trustworthy still . The young dog , George ’ s son , might possibly have been the image of his mother , for there was not much resemblance between him and George . He was learning the sheep-keeping business , so as to follow on at the flock when the other should die , but had got no further than the rudiments as yet—still finding an insuperable difficulty in distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well . So earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog ( he had no name in particular , and answered with perfect readiness to any pleasant interjection ) , that if sent behind the flock to help them on , he did it so thoroughly that he would have chased them across the whole county with the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when to stop by the example of old George . Thus much for the dogs . On the further side of Norcombe Hill was a chalk-pit , from which chalk had been drawn for generations , and spread over adjacent farms . Two hedges converged upon it in the form of a V , but without quite meeting . The narrow opening left , which was immediately over the brow of the pit , was protected by a rough railing . One night , when Farmer Oak had returned to his house , believing there would be no further necessity for his attendance on the down , he called as usual to the dogs , previously to shutting them up in the outhouse till next morning . Only one responded—old George ; the other could not be found , either in the house , lane , or garden . Gabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb ( a kind of meat he usually kept from them , except when other food ran short ) , and concluding that the young one had not finished his meal , he went indoors to the luxury of a bed , which latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays . It was a still , moist night . Just before dawn he was assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music . To the shepherd , the note of the sheep-bell , like the ticking of the clock to other people , is a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing or altering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle twinkle which signifies to the accustomed ear , however distant , that all is well in the fold . In the solemn calm of the awakening morn that note was heard by Gabriel , beating with unusual violence and rapidity . This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways—by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell , as when the flock breaks into new pasture , which gives it an intermittent rapidity , or by the sheep starting off in a run , when the sound has a regular palpitation . The experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity . He jumped out of bed , dressed , tore down the lane through a foggy dawn , and ascended the hill . The forward ewes were kept apart from those among which the fall of lambs would be later , there being two hundred of the latter class in Gabriel ’ s flock . These two hundred seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill . There were the fifty with their lambs , enclosed at the other end as he had left them , but the rest , forming the bulk of the flock , were nowhere . Gabriel called at the top of his voice the shepherd ’ s call : “ Ovey , ovey , ovey ! ” Not a single bleat . He went to the hedge ; a gap had been broken through it , and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep . Rather surprised to find them break fence at this season , yet putting it down instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter-time , of which a great deal grew in the plantation , he followed through the hedge . They were not in the plantation . He called again : the valleys and farthest hills resounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian shore ; but no sheep . He passed through the trees and along the ridge of the hill . On the extreme summit , where the ends of the two converging hedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow of the chalk-pit , he saw the younger dog standing against the sky—dark and motionless as Napoleon at St. Helena . A horrible conviction darted through Oak . With a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced : at one point the rails were broken through , and there he saw the footprints of his ewes . The dog came up , licked his hand , and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for signal services rendered . Oak looked over the precipice . The ewes lay dead and dying at its foot—a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses , representing in their condition just now at least two hundred more . Oak was an intensely humane man : indeed , his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy , and carried him on as by gravitation . A shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton—that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep . His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs . It was a second to remember another phase of the matter . The sheep were not insured . All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow ; his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low—possibly for ever . Gabriel ’ s energies , patience , and industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and eight-and-twenty , to reach his present stage of progress that no more seemed to be left in him . He leant down upon a rail , and covered his face with his hands . Stupors , however , do not last for ever , and Farmer Oak recovered from his . It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in thankfulness : — “ Thank God I am not married : what would _she_ have done in the poverty now coming upon me ! ” Oak raised his head , and wondering what he could do , listlessly surveyed the scene . By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond , and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon which had only a few days to last—the morning star dogging her on the left hand . The pool glittered like a dead man ’ s eye , and as the world awoke a breeze blew , shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon without breaking it , and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric streak upon the water . All this Oak saw and remembered . As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog , still under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep , the more he ran after them the better , had at the end of his meal off the dead lamb , which may have given him additional energy and spirits , collected all the ewes into a corner , driven the timid creatures through the hedge , across the upper field , and by main force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the rotten railing , and so hurled them over the edge . George ’ s son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too good a workman to live , and was , in fact , taken and tragically shot at twelve o ’ clock that same day—another instance of the untoward fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion , and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise . Gabriel ’ s farm had been stocked by a dealer—on the strength of Oak ’ s promising look and character—who was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off . Oak found that the value of stock , plant , and implements which were really his own would be about sufficient to pay his debts , leaving himself a free man with the clothes he stood up in , and nothing more . CHAPTER VI THE FAIR—THE JOURNEY—THE FIRE Two months passed away . We are brought on to a day in February , on which was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county-town of Casterbridge . At one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance—all men of the stamp to whom labour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation , and pleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same . Among these , carters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece of whip-cord twisted round their hats ; thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw ; shepherds held their sheep-crooks in their hands ; and thus the situation required was known to the hirers at a glance . In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of somewhat superior appearance to the rest—in fact , his superiority was marked enough to lead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly , as to a farmer , and to use “ Sir ” as a finishing word . His answer always was , — “ I am looking for a place myself—a bailiff ’ s . Do ye know of anybody who wants one ? ” Gabriel was paler now . His eyes were more meditative , and his expression was more sad . He had passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away . He had sunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very slime-pits of Siddim ; but there was left to him a dignified calm he had never before known , and that indifference to fate which , though it often makes a villain of a man , is the basis of his sublimity when it does not . And thus the abasement had been exaltation , and the loss gain . In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town , and a sergeant and his party had been beating up for recruits through the four streets . As the end of the day drew on , and he found himself not hired , Gabriel almost wished that he had joined them , and gone off to serve his country . Weary of standing in the market-place , and not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to , he decided to offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff . All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds . Sheep-tending was Gabriel ’ s speciality . Turning down an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane , he went up to a smith ’ s shop . “ How long would it take you to make a shepherd ’ s crook ? ” “ Twenty minutes. ” “ How much ? ” “ Two shillings. ” He sat on a bench and the crook was made , a stem being given him into the bargain . He then went to a ready-made clothes ’ shop , the owner of which had a large rural connection . As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel ’ s money , he attempted , and carried out , an exchange of his overcoat for a shepherd ’ s regulation smock-frock . This transaction having been completed , he again hurried off to the centre of the town , and stood on the kerb of the pavement , as a shepherd , crook in hand . Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd , it seemed that bailiffs were most in demand . However , two or three farmers noticed him and drew near . Dialogues followed , more or less in the subjoined form : — “ Where do you come from ? ” “ Norcombe. ” “ That ’ s a long way . “ Fifteen miles. ” “ Who ’ s farm were you upon last ? ” “ My own. ” This reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera . The inquiring farmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously . Gabriel , like his dog , was too good to be trustworthy , and he never made advance beyond this point . It is safer to accept any chance that offers itself , and extemporize a procedure to fit it , than to get a good plan matured , and wait for a chance of using it . Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his colours as a shepherd , but had laid himself out for anything in the whole cycle of labour that was required in the fair . It grew dusk . Some merry men were whistling and singing by the corn-exchange . Gabriel ’ s hand , which had lain for some time idle in his smock-frock pocket , touched his flute which he carried there . Here was an opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom into practice . He drew out his flute and began to play “ Jockey to the Fair ” in the style of a man who had never known a moment ’ s sorrow . Oak could pipe with Arcadian sweetness , and the sound of the well-known notes cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers . He played on with spirit , and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute man . By making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at Shottsford the next day . “ How far is Shottsford ? ” “ Ten miles t ’ other side of Weatherbury. ” Weatherbury ! It was where Bathsheba had gone two months before . This information was like coming from night into noon . “ How far is it to Weatherbury ? ” “ Five or six miles. ” Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before this time , but the place had enough interest attaching to it to lead Oak to choose Shottsford fair as his next field of inquiry , because it lay in the Weatherbury quarter . Moreover , the Weatherbury folk were by no means uninteresting intrinsically . Oak resolved to sleep at Weatherbury that night on his way to Shottsford , and struck out at once into the high road which had been recommended as the direct route to the village in question . The road stretched through water-meadows traversed by little brooks , whose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres , and folded into creases at the sides ; or , where the flow was more rapid , the stream was pied with spots of white froth , which rode on in undisturbed serenity . On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along helter-skelter upon the shoulders of the wind , and little birds in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking themselves in comfortably for the night , retaining their places if Oak kept moving , but flying away if he stopped to look at them . He passed by Yalbury Wood where the game-birds were rising to their roosts , and heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants “ cu-uck , cuck , ” and the wheezy whistle of the hens . By the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in the landscape had assumed a uniform hue of blackness . He descended Yalbury Hill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon , drawn up under a great over-hanging tree by the roadside . On coming close , he found there were no horses attached to it , the spot being apparently quite deserted . The waggon , from its position , seemed to have been left there for the night , for beyond about half a truss of hay which was heaped in the bottom , it was quite empty . Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his position . He calculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of the journey ; and having been on foot since daybreak , he felt tempted to lie down upon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the village of Weatherbury , and having to pay for a lodging . Eating his last slices of bread and ham , and drinking from the bottle of cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him , he got into the lonely waggon . Here he spread half of the hay as a bed , and , as well as he could in the darkness , pulled the other half over him by way of bed-clothes , covering himself entirely , and feeling , physically , as comfortable as ever he had been in his life . Inward melancholy it was impossible for a man like Oak , introspective far beyond his neighbours , to banish quite , whilst conning the present untoward page of his history . So , thinking of his misfortunes , amorous and pastoral , he fell asleep , shepherds enjoying , in common with sailors , the privilege of being able to summon the god instead of having to wait for him . On somewhat suddenly awaking , after a sleep of whose length he had no idea , Oak found that the waggon was in motion . He was being carried along the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without springs , and under circumstances of physical uneasiness , his head being dandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a kettledrum-stick . He then distinguished voices in conversation , coming from the forpart of the waggon . His concern at this dilemma ( which would have been alarm , had he been a thriving man ; but misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror ) led him to peer cautiously from the hay , and the first sight he beheld was the stars above him . Charles ’ s Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole star , and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine o ’ clock—in other words , that he had slept two hours . This small astronomical calculation was made without any positive effort , and whilst he was stealthily turning to discover , if possible , into whose hands he had fallen . Two figures were dimly visible in front , sitting with their legs outside the waggon , one of whom was driving . Gabriel soon found that this was the waggoner , and it appeared they had come from Casterbridge fair , like himself . A conversation was in progress , which continued thus : — “ Be as ’ twill , she ’ s a fine handsome body as far ’ s looks be concerned . But that ’ s only the skin of the woman , and these dandy cattle be as proud as a lucifer in their insides. ” “ Ay—so ’ a do seem , Billy Smallbury—so ’ a do seem. ” This utterance was very shaky by nature , and more so by circumstance , the jolting of the waggon not being without its effect upon the speaker ’ s larynx . It came from the man who held the reins . “ She ’ s a very vain feymell—so ’ tis said here and there. ” “ Ah , now . If so be ’ tis like that , I can ’ t look her in the face . Lord , no : not I—heh-heh-heh ! Such a shy man as I be ! ” “ Yes—she ’ s very vain . ’ Tis said that every night at going to bed she looks in the glass to put on her night-cap properly. ” “ And not a married woman . Oh , the world ! ” “ And ’ a can play the peanner , so ’ tis said . Can play so clever that ’ a can make a psalm tune sound as well as the merriest loose song a man can wish for. ” “ D ’ ye tell o ’ t ! A happy time for us , and I feel quite a new man ! And how do she pay ? ” “ That I don ’ t know , Master Poorgrass. ” On hearing these and other similar remarks , a wild thought flashed into Gabriel ’ s mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba . There were , however , no grounds for retaining such a supposition , for the waggon , though going in the direction of Weatherbury , might be going beyond it , and the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some estate . They were now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the speakers unnecessarily , Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen . He turned to an opening in the hedge , which he found to be a gate , and mounting thereon , he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in the village , or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under some hay or corn-stack . The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon his ear . He was about to walk on , when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light—appearing about half a mile distant . Oak watched it , and the glow increased . Something was on fire . Gabriel again mounted the gate , and , leaping down on the other side upon what he found to be ploughed soil , made across the field in the exact direction of the fire . The blaze , enlarging in a double ratio by his approach and its own increase , showed him as he drew nearer the outlines of ricks beside it , lighted up to great distinctness . A rick-yard was the source of the fire . His weary face now began to be painted over with a rich orange glow , and the whole front of his smock-frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of thorn-twigs—the light reaching him through a leafless intervening hedge—and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook shone silver-bright in the same abounding rays . He came up to the boundary fence , and stood to regain breath . It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by a living soul . The fire was issuing from a long straw-stack , which was so far gone as to preclude a possibility of saving it . A rick burns differently from a house . As the wind blows the fire inwards , the portion in flames completely disappears like melting sugar , and the outline is lost to the eye . However , a hay or a wheat-rick , well put together , will resist combustion for a length of time , if it begins on the outside . This before Gabriel ’ s eyes was a rick of straw , loosely put together , and the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness . It glowed on the windward side , rising and falling in intensity , like the coal of a cigar . Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down , with a whisking noise ; flames elongated , and bent themselves about with a quiet roar , but no crackle . Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds , and behind these burned hidden pyres , illuminating the semi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity . Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat , as if they were knots of red worms , and above shone imaginary fiery faces , tongues hanging from lips , glaring eyes , and other impish forms , from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest . Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case to be more serious than he had at first imagined . A scroll of smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition with the decaying one , and behind this a series of others , composing the main corn produce of the farm ; so that instead of the straw-stack standing , as he had imagined comparatively isolated , there was a regular connection between it and the remaining stacks of the group . Gabriel leapt over the hedge , and saw that he was not alone . The first man he came to was running about in a great hurry , as if his thoughts were several yards in advance of his body , which they could never drag on fast enough . “ O , man—fire , fire ! A good master and a bad servant is fire , fire ! —I mane a bad servant and a good master . Oh , Mark Clark—come ! And you , Billy Smallbury—and you , Maryann Money—and you , Jan Coggan , and Matthew there ! ” Other figures now appeared behind this shouting man and among the smoke , and Gabriel found that , far from being alone he was in a great company—whose shadows danced merrily up and down , timed by the jigging of the flames , and not at all by their owners ’ movements . The assemblage—belonging to that class of society which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling , and its feelings into the form of commotion—set to work with a remarkable confusion of purpose . “ Stop the draught under the wheat-rick ! ” cried Gabriel to those nearest to him . The corn stood on stone staddles , and between these , tongues of yellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully . If the fire once got _under_ this stack , all would be lost . “ Get a tarpaulin—quick ! ” said Gabriel . A rick-cloth was brought , and they hung it like a curtain across the channel . The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the corn-stack , and stood up vertical . “ Stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet. ” said Gabriel again . The flames , now driven upwards , began to attack the angles of the huge roof covering the wheat-stack . “ A ladder , ” cried Gabriel . “ The ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt to a cinder , ” said a spectre-like form in the smoke . Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves , as if he were going to engage in the operation of “ reed-drawing , ” and digging in his feet , and occasionally sticking in the stem of his sheep-crook , he clambered up the beetling face . He at once sat astride the very apex , and began with his crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had lodged thereon , shouting to the others to get him a bough and a ladder , and some water . Billy Smallbury—one of the men who had been on the waggon—by this time had found a ladder , which Mark Clark ascended , holding on beside Oak upon the thatch . The smoke at this corner was stifling , and Clark , a nimble fellow , having been handed a bucket of water , bathed Oak ’ s face and sprinkled him generally , whilst Gabriel , now with a long beech-bough in one hand , in addition to his crook in the other , kept sweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles . On the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing all they could to keep down the conflagration , which was not much . They were all tinged orange , and backed up by shadows of varying pattern . Round the corner of the largest stack , out of the direct rays of the fire , stood a pony , bearing a young woman on its back . By her side was another woman , on foot . These two seemed to keep at a distance from the fire , that the horse might not become restive . “ He ’ s a shepherd , ” said the woman on foot . “ Yes—he is . See how his crook shines as he beats the rick with it . And his smock-frock is burnt in two holes , I declare ! A fine young shepherd he is too , ma ’ am. ” “ Whose shepherd is he ? ” said the equestrian in a clear voice . “ Don ’ t know , ma ’ am. ” “ Don ’ t any of the others know ? ” “ Nobody at all—I ’ ve asked ’ em . Quite a stranger , they say. ” The young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked anxiously around . “ Do you think the barn is safe ? ” she said . “ D ’ ye think the barn is safe , Jan Coggan ? ” said the second woman , passing on the question to the nearest man in that direction . “ Safe now—leastwise I think so . If this rick had gone the barn would have followed . ’ Tis that bold shepherd up there that have done the most good—he sitting on the top o ’ rick , whizzing his great long arms about like a windmill. ” “ He does work hard , ” said the young woman on horseback , looking up at Gabriel through her thick woollen veil . “ I wish he was shepherd here . Don ’ t any of you know his name. ” “ Never heard the man ’ s name in my life , or seed his form afore. ” The fire began to get worsted , and Gabriel ’ s elevated position being no longer required of him , he made as if to descend . “ Maryann , ” said the girl on horseback , “ go to him as he comes down , and say that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he has done. ” Maryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the ladder . She delivered her message . “ Where is your master the farmer ? ” asked Gabriel , kindling with the idea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now . “ ’ Tisn ’ t a master ; ’ tis a mistress , shepherd. ” “ A woman farmer ? ” “ Ay , ’ a b ’ lieve , and a rich one too ! ” said a bystander . “ Lately ’ a came here from a distance . Took on her uncle ’ s farm , who died suddenly . Used to measure his money in half-pint cups . They say now that she ’ ve business in every bank in Casterbridge , and thinks no more of playing pitch-and-toss sovereign than you and I do pitch-halfpenny—not a bit in the world , shepherd. ” “ That ’ s she , back there upon the pony , ” said Maryann ; “ wi ’ her face a-covered up in that black cloth with holes in it. ” Oak , his features smudged , grimy , and undiscoverable from the smoke and heat , his smock-frock burnt into holes and dripping with water , the ash stem of his sheep-crook charred six inches shorter , advanced with the humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to the slight female form in the saddle . He lifted his hat with respect , and not without gallantry : stepping close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice , — “ Do you happen to want a shepherd , ma ’ am ? ” She lifted the wool veil tied round her face , and looked all astonishment . Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling , Bathsheba Everdene , were face to face . Bathsheba did not speak , and he mechanically repeated in an abashed and sad voice , — “ Do you want a shepherd , ma ’ am ? ” CHAPTER VII RECOGNITION—A TIMID GIRL Bathsheba withdrew into the shade . She scarcely knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of the meeting , or to be concerned at its awkwardness . There was room for a little pity , also for a very little exultation : the former at his position , the latter at her own . Embarrassed she was not , and she remembered Gabriel ’ s declaration of love to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it . “ Yes , ” she murmured , putting on an air of dignity , and turning again to him with a little warmth of cheek ; “ I do want a shepherd . But— ” “ He ’ s the very man , ma ’ am , ” said one of the villagers , quietly . Conviction breeds conviction . “ Ay , that ’ a is , ” said a second , decisively . “ The man , truly ! ” said a third , with heartiness . “ He ’ s all there ! ” said number four , fervidly . “ Then will you tell him to speak to the bailiff ? ” said Bathsheba . All was practical again now . A summer eve and loneliness would have been necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance . The bailiff was pointed out to Gabriel , who , checking the palpitation within his breast at discovering that this Ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of Venus the well-known and admired , retired with him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring . The fire before them wasted away . “ Men , ” said Bathsheba , “ you shall take a little refreshment after this extra work . Will you come to the house ? ” “ We could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal freer , Miss , if so be ye ’ d send it to Warren ’ s Malthouse , ” replied the spokesman . Bathsheba then rode off into the darkness , and the men straggled on to the village in twos and threes—Oak and the bailiff being left by the rick alone . “ And now , ” said the bailiff , finally , “ all is settled , I think , about your coming , and I am going home-along . Good-night to ye , shepherd. ” “ Can you get me a lodging ? ” inquired Gabriel . “ That I can ’ t , indeed , ” he said , moving past Oak as a Christian edges past an offertory-plate when he does not mean to contribute . “ If you follow on the road till you come to Warren ’ s Malthouse , where they are all gone to have their snap of victuals , I daresay some of ’ em will tell you of a place . Good-night to ye , shepherd. ” The bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as himself , went up the hill , and Oak walked on to the village , still astonished at the reencounter with Bathsheba , glad of his nearness to her , and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here . But some women only require an emergency to make them fit for one . Obliged , to some extent , to forgo dreaming in order to find the way , he reached the churchyard , and passed round it under the wall where several ancient trees grew . There was a wide margin of grass along here , and Gabriel ’ s footsteps were deadened by its softness , even at this indurating period of the year . When abreast of a trunk which appeared to be the oldest of the old , he became aware that a figure was standing behind it . Gabriel did not pause in his walk , and in another moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone . The noise was enough to disturb the motionless stranger , who started and assumed a careless position . It was a slim girl , rather thinly clad . “ Good-night to you , ” said Gabriel , heartily . “ Good-night , ” said the girl to Gabriel . The voice was unexpectedly attractive ; it was the low and dulcet note suggestive of romance ; common in descriptions , rare in experience . “ I ’ ll thank you to tell me if I ’ m in the way for Warren ’ s Malthouse ? ” Gabriel resumed , primarily to gain the information , indirectly to get more of the music . “ Quite right . It ’ s at the bottom of the hill . And do you know— ” The girl hesitated and then went on again . “ Do you know how late they keep open the Buck ’ s Head Inn ? ” She seemed to be won by Gabriel ’ s heartiness , as Gabriel had been won by her modulations . “ I don ’ t know where the Buck ’ s Head is , or anything about it . Do you think of going there to-night ? ” “ Yes— ” The woman again paused . There was no necessity for any continuance of speech , and the fact that she did add more seemed to proceed from an unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a remark , which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they are acting by stealth . “ You are not a Weatherbury man ? ” she said , timorously . “ I am not . I am the new shepherd—just arrived. ” “ Only a shepherd—and you seem almost a farmer by your ways. ” “ Only a shepherd , ” Gabriel repeated , in a dull cadence of finality . His thoughts were directed to the past , his eyes to the feet of the girl ; and for the first time he saw lying there a bundle of some sort . She may have perceived the direction of his face , for she said coaxingly , — “ You won ’ t say anything in the parish about having seen me here , will you—at least , not for a day or two ? ” “ I won ’ t if you wish me not to , ” said Oak . “ Thank you , indeed , ” the other replied . “ I am rather poor , and I don ’ t want people to know anything about me. ” Then she was silent and shivered . “ You ought to have a cloak on such a cold night , ” Gabriel observed . “ I would advise ’ ee to get indoors. ” “ O no ! Would you mind going on and leaving me ? I thank you much for what you have told me. ” “ I will go on , ” he said ; adding hesitatingly , — “ Since you are not very well off , perhaps you would accept this trifle from me . It is only a shilling , but it is all I have to spare. ” “ Yes , I will take it , ” said the stranger gratefully . She extended her hand ; Gabriel his . In feeling for each other ’ s palm in the gloom before the money could be passed , a minute incident occurred which told much . Gabriel ’ s fingers alighted on the young woman ’ s wrist . It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity . He had frequently felt the same quick , hard beat in the femoral artery of his lambs when overdriven . It suggested a consumption too great of a vitality which , to judge from her figure and stature , was already too little . “ What is the matter ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ But there is ? ” “ No , no , no ! Let your having seen me be a secret ! ” “ Very well ; I will . Good-night , again. ” “ Good-night. ” The young girl remained motionless by the tree , and Gabriel descended into the village of Weatherbury , or Lower Longpuddle as it was sometimes called . He fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile creature . But wisdom lies in moderating mere impressions , and Gabriel endeavoured to think little of this . CHAPTER VIII THE MALTHOUSE—THE CHAT—NEWS Warren ’ s Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall inwrapped with ivy , and though not much of the exterior was visible at this hour , the character and purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by its outline upon the sky . From the walls an overhanging thatched roof sloped up to a point in the centre , upon which rose a small wooden lantern , fitted with louvre-boards on all the four sides , and from these openings a mist was dimly perceived to be escaping into the night air . There was no window in front ; but a square hole in the door was glazed with a single pane , through which red , comfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front . Voices were to be heard inside . Oak ’ s hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to an Elymas-the-Sorcerer pattern , till he found a leathern strap , which he pulled . This lifted a wooden latch , and the door swung open . The room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow from the kiln mouth , which shone over the floor with the streaming horizontality of the setting sun , and threw upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those assembled around . The stone-flag floor was worn into a path from the doorway to the kiln , and into undulations everywhere . A curved settle of unplaned oak stretched along one side , and in a remote corner was a small bed and bedstead , the owner and frequent occupier of which was the maltster . This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire , his frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless apple-tree . He wore breeches and the laced-up shoes called ankle-jacks ; he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire . Gabriel ’ s nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet smell of new malt . The conversation ( which seemed to have been concerning the origin of the fire ) immediately ceased , and every one ocularly criticised him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eyelids , as if he had been a light too strong for their sight . Several exclaimed meditatively , after this operation had been completed : — “ Oh , ’ tis the new shepherd , ’ a b ’ lieve. ” “ We thought we heard a hand pawing about the door for the bobbin , but weren ’ t sure ’ twere not a dead leaf blowed across , ” said another . “ Come in , shepherd ; sure ye be welcome , though we don ’ t know yer name. ” “ Gabriel Oak , that ’ s my name , neighbours. ” The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned at this—his turning being as the turning of a rusty crane . “ That ’ s never Gable Oak ’ s grandson over at Norcombe—never ! ” he said , as a formula expressive of surprise , which nobody was supposed for a moment to take literally . “ My father and my grandfather were old men of the name of Gabriel , ” said the shepherd , placidly . “ Thought I knowed the man ’ s face as I seed him on the rick ! —thought I did ! And where be ye trading o ’ t to now , shepherd ? ” “ I ’ m thinking of biding here , ” said Mr. Oak . “ Knowed yer grandfather for years and years ! ” continued the maltster , the words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum previously imparted had been sufficient . “ Ah—and did you ! ” “ Knowed yer grandmother. ” “ And her too ! ” “ Likewise knowed yer father when he was a child . Why , my boy Jacob there and your father were sworn brothers—that they were sure—weren ’ t ye , Jacob ? ” “ Ay , sure , ” said his son , a young man about sixty-five , with a semi-bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw , which made much of itself by standing prominent , like a milestone in a bank . “ But ’ twas Joe had most to do with him . However , my son William must have knowed the very man afore us—didn ’ t ye , Billy , afore ye left Norcombe ? ” “ No , ’ twas Andrew , ” said Jacob ’ s son Billy , a child of forty , or thereabouts , who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy body , and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here and there . “ I can mind Andrew , ” said Oak , “ as being a man in the place when I was quite a child. ” “ Ay—the other day I and my youngest daughter , Liddy , were over at my grandson ’ s christening , ” continued Billy . “ We were talking about this very family , and ’ twas only last Purification Day in this very world , when the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor folk , you know , shepherd , and I can mind the day because they all had to traypse up to the vestry—yes , this very man ’ s family. ” “ Come , shepherd , and drink . ’ Tis gape and swaller with us—a drap of sommit , but not of much account , ” said the maltster , removing from the fire his eyes , which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing into it for so many years . “ Take up the God-forgive-me , Jacob . See if ’ tis warm , Jacob. ” Jacob stooped to the God-forgive-me , which was a two-handled tall mug standing in the ashes , cracked and charred with heat : it was rather furred with extraneous matter about the outside , especially in the crevices of the handles , the innermost curves of which may not have seen daylight for several years by reason of this encrustation thereon—formed of ashes accidentally wetted with cider and baked hard ; but to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that , being incontestably clean on the inside and about the rim . It may be observed that such a class of mug is called a God-forgive-me in Weatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons ; probably because its size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he sees its bottom in drinking it empty . Jacob , on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough , placidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer , and having pronounced it nearly of the proper degree , raised the cup and very civilly attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with the skirt of his smock-frock , because Shepherd Oak was a stranger . “ A clane cup for the shepherd , ” said the maltster commandingly . “ No—not at all , ” said Gabriel , in a reproving tone of considerateness . “ I never fuss about dirt in its pure state , and when I know what sort it is. ” Taking the mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its contents , and duly passed it to the next man . “ I wouldn ’ t think of giving such trouble to neighbours in washing up when there ’ s so much work to be done in the world already , ” continued Oak in a moister tone , after recovering from the stoppage of breath which is occasioned by pulls at large mugs . “ A right sensible man , ” said Jacob . “ True , true ; it can ’ t be gainsaid ! ” observed a brisk young man—Mark Clark by name , a genial and pleasant gentleman , whom to meet anywhere in your travels was to know , to know was to drink with , and to drink with was , unfortunately , to pay for . “ And here ’ s a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis ’ ess have sent , shepherd . The cider will go down better with a bit of victuals . Don ’ t ye chaw quite close , shepherd , for I let the bacon fall in the road outside as I was bringing it along , and may be ’ tis rather gritty . There , ’ tis clane dirt ; and we all know what that is , as you say , and you bain ’ t a particular man we see , shepherd. ” “ True , true—not at all , ” said the friendly Oak . “ Don ’ t let your teeth quite meet , and you won ’ t feel the sandiness at all . Ah ! ’ tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance ! ” “ My own mind exactly , neighbour. ” “ Ah , he ’ s his grandfer ’ s own grandson ! —his grandfer were just such a nice unparticular man ! ” said the maltster . “ Drink , Henry Fray—drink , ” magnanimously said Jan Coggan , a person who held Saint-Simonian notions of share and share alike where liquor was concerned , as the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual revolution among them . Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful gaze into mid-air , Henry did not refuse . He was a man of more than middle age , with eyebrows high up in his forehead , who laid it down that the law of the world was bad , with a long-suffering look through his listeners at the world alluded to , as it presented itself to his imagination . He always signed his name “ Henery ” —strenuously insisting upon that spelling , and if any passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second “ e ” was superfluous and old-fashioned , he received the reply that “ H-e-n-e-r-y ” was the name he was christened and the name he would stick to—in the tone of one to whom orthographical differences were matters which had a great deal to do with personal character . Mr. Jan Coggan , who had passed the cup to Henery , was a crimson man with a spacious countenance and private glimmer in his eye , whose name had appeared on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbouring parishes as best man and chief witness in countless unions of the previous twenty years ; he also very frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms of the subtly-jovial kind . “ Come , Mark Clark—come . Ther ’ s plenty more in the barrel , ” said Jan. “ Ay—that I will , ’ tis my only doctor , ” replied Mr. Clark , who , twenty years younger than Jan Coggan , revolved in the same orbit . He secreted mirth on all occasions for special discharge at popular parties . “ Why , Joseph Poorgrass , ye han ’ t had a drop ! ” said Mr. Coggan to a self-conscious man in the background , thrusting the cup towards him . “ Such a modest man as he is ! ” said Jacob Smallbury . “ Why , ye ’ ve hardly had strength of eye enough to look in our young mis ’ ess ’ s face , so I hear , Joseph ? ” All looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach . “ No—I ’ ve hardly looked at her at all , ” simpered Joseph , reducing his body smaller whilst talking , apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence . “ And when I seed her , ’ twas nothing but blushes with me ! ” “ Poor feller , ” said Mr. Clark . “ ’ Tis a curious nature for a man , ” said Jan Coggan . “ Yes , ” continued Joseph Poorgrass—his shyness , which was so painful as a defect , filling him with a mild complacency now that it was regarded as an interesting study . “ ’ Twere blush , blush , blush with me every minute of the time , when she was speaking to me. ” “ I believe ye , Joseph Poorgrass , for we all know ye to be a very bashful man. ” “ ’ Tis a ’ awkward gift for a man , poor soul , ” said the maltster . “ And how long have ye have suffered from it , Joseph ? ” “ Oh , ever since I was a boy . Yes—mother was concerned to her heart about it—yes . But ’ twas all nought. ” “ Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it , Joseph Poorgrass ? ” “ Oh ay , tried all sorts o ’ company . They took me to Greenhill Fair , and into a great gay jerry-go-nimble show , where there were women-folk riding round—standing upon horses , with hardly anything on but their smocks ; but it didn ’ t cure me a morsel . And then I was put errand-man at the Women ’ s Skittle Alley at the back of the Tailor ’ s Arms in Casterbridge . ’ Twas a horrible sinful situation , and a very curious place for a good man . I had to stand and look ba ’ dy people in the face from morning till night ; but ’ twas no use—I was just as bad as ever after all . Blushes hev been in the family for generations . There , ’ tis a happy providence that I be no worse. ” “ True , ” said Jacob Smallbury , deepening his thoughts to a profounder view of the subject . “ ’ Tis a thought to look at , that ye might have been worse ; but even as you be , ’ tis a very bad affliction for ’ ee , Joseph . For ye see , shepherd , though ’ tis very well for a woman , dang it all , ’ tis awkward for a man like him , poor feller ? ” “ ’ Tis— ’ tis , ” said Gabriel , recovering from a meditation . “ Yes , very awkward for the man. ” “ Ay , and he ’ s very timid , too , ” observed Jan Coggan . “ Once he had been working late at Yalbury Bottom , and had had a drap of drink , and lost his way as he was coming home-along through Yalbury Wood , didn ’ t ye , Master Poorgrass ? ” “ No , no , no ; not that story ! ” expostulated the modest man , forcing a laugh to bury his concern . “ —And so ’ a lost himself quite , ” continued Mr. Coggan , with an impassive face , implying that a true narrative , like time and tide , must run its course and would respect no man . “ And as he was coming along in the middle of the night , much afeared , and not able to find his way out of the trees nohow , ’ a cried out , ‘ Man-a-lost ! man-a-lost ! ’ A owl in a tree happened to be crying ‘ Whoo-whoo-whoo ! ’ as owls do , you know , shepherd ” ( Gabriel nodded ) , “ and Joseph , all in a tremble , said , ‘ Joseph Poorgrass , of Weatherbury , sir ! ’ ” “ No , no , now—that ’ s too much ! ” said the timid man , becoming a man of brazen courage all of a sudden . “ I didn ’ t say _sir_ . I ’ ll take my oath I didn ’ t say ‘ Joseph Poorgrass o ’ Weatherbury , sir. ’ No , no ; what ’ s right is right , and I never said sir to the bird , knowing very well that no man of a gentleman ’ s rank would be hollering there at that time o ’ night . ‘ Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury , ’ —that ’ s every word I said , and I shouldn ’ t ha ’ said that if ’ t hadn ’ t been for Keeper Day ’ s metheglin .... There , ’ twas a merciful thing it ended where it did. ” The question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company , Jan went on meditatively : — “ And he ’ s the fearfullest man , bain ’ t ye , Joseph ? Ay , another time ye were lost by Lambing-Down Gate , weren ’ t ye , Joseph ? ” “ I was , ” replied Poorgrass , as if there were some conditions too serious even for modesty to remember itself under , this being one . “ Yes ; that were the middle of the night , too . The gate would not open , try how he would , and knowing there was the Devil ’ s hand in it , he kneeled down. ” “ Ay , ” said Joseph , acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire , the cider , and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the experience alluded to . “ My heart died within me , that time ; but I kneeled down and said the Lord ’ s Prayer , and then the Belief right through , and then the Ten Commandments , in earnest prayer . But no , the gate wouldn ’ t open ; and then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren , and , thinks I , this makes four , and ’ tis all I know out of book , and if this don ’ t do it nothing will , and I ’ m a lost man . Well , when I got to Saying After Me , I rose from my knees and found the gate would open—yes , neighbours , the gate opened the same as ever. ” A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all , and during its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit , which glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun , shaping their eyes long and liny , partly because of the light , partly from the depth of the subject discussed . Gabriel broke the silence . “ What sort of a place is this to live at , and what sort of a mis ’ ess is she to work under ? ” Gabriel ’ s bosom thrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the inner-most subject of his heart . “ We d ’ know little of her—nothing . She only showed herself a few days ago . Her uncle was took bad , and the doctor was called with his world-wide skill ; but he couldn ’ t save the man . As I take it , she ’ s going to keep on the farm . “ That ’ s about the shape o ’ t , ’ a b ’ lieve , ” said Jan Coggan . “ Ay , ’ tis a very good family . I ’ d as soon be under ’ em as under one here and there . Her uncle was a very fair sort of man . Did ye know en , shepherd—a bachelor-man ? ” “ Not at all. ” “ I used to go to his house a-courting my first wife , Charlotte , who was his dairymaid . Well , a very good-hearted man were Farmer Everdene , and I being a respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see her and drink as much ale as I liked , but not to carry away any—outside my skin I mane of course. ” “ Ay , ay , Jan Coggan ; we know yer maning. ” “ And so you see ’ twas beautiful ale , and I wished to value his kindness as much as I could , and not to be so ill-mannered as to drink only a thimbleful , which would have been insulting the man ’ s generosity— ” “ True , Master Coggan , ’ twould so , ” corroborated Mark Clark . “ —And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore going , and then by the time I got there I were as dry as a lime-basket—so thorough dry that that ale would slip down—ah , ’ twould slip down sweet ! Happy times ! Heavenly times ! Such lovely drunks as I used to have at that house ! You can mind , Jacob ? You used to go wi ’ me sometimes. ” “ I can—I can , ” said Jacob . “ That one , too , that we had at Buck ’ s Head on a White Monday was a pretty tipple. ” “ ’ Twas . But for a wet of the better class , that brought you no nearer to the horned man than you were afore you begun , there was none like those in Farmer Everdene ’ s kitchen . Not a single damn allowed ; no , not a bare poor one , even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest , though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great relief to a merry soul. ” “ True , ” said the maltster . “ Nater requires her swearing at the regular times , or she ’ s not herself ; and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life. ” “ But Charlotte , ” continued Coggan— “ not a word of the sort would Charlotte allow , nor the smallest item of taking in vain .... Ay , poor Charlotte , I wonder if she had the good fortune to get into Heaven when ’ a died ! But ’ a was never much in luck ’ s way , and perhaps ’ a went downwards after all , poor soul. ” “ And did any of you know Miss Everdene ’ s father and mother ? ” inquired the shepherd , who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired channel . “ I knew them a little , ” said Jacob Smallbury ; “ but they were townsfolk , and didn ’ t live here . They ’ ve been dead for years . Father , what sort of people were mis ’ ess ’ father and mother ? ” “ Well , ” said the maltster , “ he wasn ’ t much to look at ; but she was a lovely woman . He was fond enough of her as his sweetheart. ” “ Used to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o ’ times , so ’ twas said , ” observed Coggan . “ He was very proud of her , too , when they were married , as I ’ ve been told , ” said the maltster . “ Ay , ” said Coggan . “ He admired her so much that he used to light the candle three times a night to look at her. ” “ Boundless love ; I shouldn ’ t have supposed it in the universe ! ” murmured Joseph Poorgrass , who habitually spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections . “ Well , to be sure , ” said Gabriel . “ Oh , ’ tis true enough . I knowed the man and woman both well . Levi Everdene—that was the man ’ s name , sure . ‘ Man , ’ saith I in my hurry , but he were of a higher circle of life than that— ’ a was a gentleman-tailor really , worth scores of pounds . And he became a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times. ” “ Oh , I thought he was quite a common man ! ” said Joseph . “ Oh no , no ! That man failed for heaps of money ; hundreds in gold and silver. ” The maltster being rather short of breath , Mr. Coggan , after absently scrutinising a coal which had fallen among the ashes , took up the narrative , with a private twirl of his eye : — “ Well , now , you ’ d hardly believe it , but that man—our Miss Everdene ’ s father—was one of the ficklest husbands alive , after a while . Understand ? ’ a didn ’ t want to be fickle , but he couldn ’ t help it . The pore feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish , but his heart would rove , do what he would . He spoke to me in real tribulation about it once . ‘ Coggan , ’ he said , ‘ I could never wish for a handsomer woman than I ’ ve got , but feeling she ’ s ticketed as my lawful wife , I can ’ t help my wicked heart wandering , do what I will. ’ But at last I believe he cured it by making her take off her wedding-ring and calling her by her maiden name as they sat together after the shop was shut , and so ’ a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart , and not married to him at all . And as soon as he could thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and committing the seventh , ’ a got to like her as well as ever , and they lived on a perfect picture of mutel love. ” “ Well , ’ twas a most ungodly remedy , ” murmured Joseph Poorgrass ; “ but we ought to feel deep cheerfulness that a happy Providence kept it from being any worse . You see , he might have gone the bad road and given his eyes to unlawfulness entirely—yes , gross unlawfulness , so to say it. ” “ You see , ” said Billy Smallbury , “ The man ’ s will was to do right , sure enough , but his heart didn ’ t chime in. ” “ He got so much better , that he was quite godly in his later years , wasn ’ t he , Jan ? ” said Joseph Poorgrass . “ He got himself confirmed over again in a more serious way , and took to saying ‘ Amen ’ almost as loud as the clerk , and he liked to copy comforting verses from the tombstones . He used , too , to hold the money-plate at Let Your Light so Shine , and stand godfather to poor little come-by-chance children ; and he kept a missionary box upon his table to nab folks unawares when they called ; yes , and he would box the charity-boys ’ ears , if they laughed in church , till they could hardly stand upright , and do other deeds of piety natural to the saintly inclined. ” “ Ay , at that time he thought of nothing but high things , ” added Billy Smallbury . “ One day Parson Thirdly met him and said , ‘ Good-Morning , Mister Everdene ; ’ tis a fine day ! ’ ‘ Amen ’ said Everdene , quite absent-like , thinking only of religion when he seed a parson . Yes , he was a very Christian man. ” “ Their daughter was not at all a pretty chiel at that time , ” said Henery Fray . “ Never should have thought she ’ d have growed up such a handsome body as she is. ” “ ’ Tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face. ” “ Well , yes ; but the baily will have most to do with the business and ourselves . Ah ! ” Henery gazed into the ashpit , and smiled volumes of ironical knowledge . “ A queer Christian , like the Devil ’ s head in a cowl , [ 1 ] as the saying is , ” volunteered Mark Clark . “ He is , ” said Henery , implying that irony must cease at a certain point . “ Between we two , man and man , I believe that man would as soon tell a lie Sundays as working-days—that I do so. ” “ Good faith , you do talk ! ” said Gabriel . “ True enough , ” said the man of bitter moods , looking round upon the company with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener appreciation of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable of . “ Ah , there ’ s people of one sort , and people of another , but that man—bless your souls ! ” Gabriel thought fit to change the subject . “ You must be a very aged man , malter , to have sons growed mild and ancient , ” he remarked . “ Father ’ s so old that ’ a can ’ t mind his age , can ye , father ? ” interposed Jacob . “ And he ’ s growed terrible crooked too , lately , ” Jacob continued , surveying his father ’ s figure , which was rather more bowed than his own . “ Really one may say that father there is three-double. ” “ Crooked folk will last a long while , ” said the maltster , grimly , and not in the best humour . “ Shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life , father—wouldn ’ t ye , shepherd ? ” “ Ay , that I should , ” said Gabriel with the heartiness of a man who had longed to hear it for several months . “ What may your age be , malter ? ” The maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis , and elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit , said , in the slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so generally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it , “ Well , I don ’ t mind the year I were born in , but perhaps I can reckon up the places I ’ ve lived at , and so get it that way . I bode at Upper Longpuddle across there ” ( nodding to the north ) “ till I were eleven . I bode seven at Kingsbere ” ( nodding to the east ) “ where I took to malting . I went therefrom to Norcombe , and malted there two-and-twenty years , and-two-and-twenty years I was there turnip-hoeing and harvesting . Ah , I knowed that old place , Norcombe , years afore you were thought of , Master Oak ” ( Oak smiled sincere belief in the fact ) . “ Then I malted at Durnover four year , and four year turnip-hoeing ; and I was fourteen times eleven months at Millpond St. Jude ’ s ” ( nodding north-west-by-north ) . “ Old Twills wouldn ’ t hire me for more than eleven months at a time , to keep me from being chargeable to the parish if so be I was disabled . Then I was three year at Mellstock , and I ’ ve been here one-and-thirty year come Candlemas . How much is that ? ” “ Hundred and seventeen , ” chuckled another old gentleman , given to mental arithmetic and little conversation , who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner . “ Well , then , that ’ s my age , ” said the maltster , emphatically . “ O no , father ! ” said Jacob . “ Your turnip-hoeing were in the summer and your malting in the winter of the same years , and ye don ’ t ought to count-both halves , father. ” “ Chok ’ it all ! I lived through the summers , didn ’ t I ? That ’ s my question . I suppose ye ’ ll say next I be no age at all to speak of ? ” “ Sure we shan ’ t , ” said Gabriel , soothingly . “ Ye be a very old aged person , malter , ” attested Jan Coggan , also soothingly . “ We all know that , and ye must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able to live so long , mustn ’ t he , neighbours ? ” “ True , true ; ye must , malter , wonderful , ” said the meeting unanimously . The maltster , being now pacified , was even generous enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the virtue of having lived a great many years , by mentioning that the cup they were drinking out of was three years older than he . While the cup was being examined , the end of Gabriel Oak ’ s flute became visible over his smock-frock pocket , and Henery Fray exclaimed , “ Surely , shepherd , I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at Casterbridge ? ” “ You did , ” said Gabriel , blushing faintly . “ I ’ ve been in great trouble , neighbours , and was driven to it . I used not to be so poor as I be now. ” “ Never mind , heart ! ” said Mark Clark . “ You should take it careless-like , shepherd , and your time will come . But we could thank ye for a tune , if ye bain ’ t too tired ? ” “ Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since Christmas , ” said Jan Coggan . “ Come , raise a tune , Master Oak ! ” “ Ay , that I will , ” said Gabriel , pulling out his flute and putting it together . “ A poor tool , neighbours ; but such as I can do ye shall have and welcome. ” Oak then struck up “ Jockey to the Fair , ” and played that sparkling melody three times through , accenting the notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks and tapping with his foot to beat time . “ He can blow the flute very well—that ’ a can , ” said a young married man , who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as “ Susan Tall ’ s husband. ” He continued , “ I ’ d as lief as not be able to blow into a flute as well as that. ” “ He ’ s a clever man , and ’ tis a true comfort for us to have such a shepherd , ” murmured Joseph Poorgrass , in a soft cadence . “ We ought to feel full o ’ thanksgiving that he ’ s not a player of ba ’ dy songs instead of these merry tunes ; for ’ twould have been just as easy for God to have made the shepherd a loose low man—a man of iniquity , so to speak it—as what he is . Yes , for our wives ’ and daughters ’ sakes we should feel real thanksgiving. ” “ True , true , —real thanksgiving ! ” dashed in Mark Clark conclusively , not feeling it to be of any consequence to his opinion that he had only heard about a word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said . “ Yes , ” added Joseph , beginning to feel like a man in the Bible ; “ for evil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in the cleanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the turnpike , if I may term it so. ” “ Ay , I can mind yer face now , shepherd , ” said Henery Fray , criticising Gabriel with misty eyes as he entered upon his second tune . “ Yes—now I see ’ ee blowing into the flute I know ’ ee to be the same man I see play at Casterbridge , for yer mouth were scrimped up and yer eyes a-staring out like a strangled man ’ s—just as they be now. ” “ ’ Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a scarecrow , ” observed Mr. Mark Clark , with additional criticism of Gabriel ’ s countenance , the latter person jerking out , with the ghastly grimace required by the instrument , the chorus of “ Dame Durden : ” — ’ Twas Moll ’ and Bet ’ , and Doll ’ and Kate ’ , And Dor ’ -othy Drag ’ -gle Tail ’ . “ I hope you don ’ t mind that young man ’ s bad manners in naming your features ? ” whispered Joseph to Gabriel . “ Not at all , ” said Mr. Oak . “ For by nature ye be a very handsome man , shepherd , ” continued Joseph Poorgrass , with winning sauvity . “ Ay , that ye be , shepard , ” said the company . “ Thank you very much , ” said Oak , in the modest tone good manners demanded , thinking , however , that he would never let Bathsheba see him playing the flute ; in this resolve showing a discretion equal to that related to its sagacious inventress , the divine Minerva herself . “ Ah , when I and my wife were married at Norcombe Church , ” said the old maltster , not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject , “ we were called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood—everybody said so. ” “ Danged if ye bain ’ t altered now , malter , ” said a voice with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remarkably evident truism . It came from the old man in the background , whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he contributed to general laughs . “ O no , no , ” said Gabriel . “ Don ’ t ye play no more shepherd ” said Susan Tall ’ s husband , the young married man who had spoken once before . “ I must be moving and when there ’ s tunes going on I seem as if hung in wires . If I thought after I ’ d left that music was still playing , and I not there , I should be quite melancholy-like. ” “ What ’ s yer hurry then , Laban ? ” inquired Coggan . “ You used to bide as late as the latest. ” “ Well , ye see , neighbours , I was lately married to a woman , and she ’ s my vocation now , and so ye see— ” The young man halted lamely . “ New Lords new laws , as the saying is , I suppose , ” remarked Coggan . “ Ay , ’ a b ’ lieve—ha , ha ! ” said Susan Tall ’ s husband , in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding them at all . The young man then wished them good-night and withdrew . Henery Fray was the first to follow . Then Gabriel arose and went off with Jan Coggan , who had offered him a lodging . A few minutes later , when the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart , Fray came back again in a hurry . Flourishing his finger ominously he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just where his eye alighted by accident , which happened to be in Joseph Poorgrass ’ s face . “ O—what ’ s the matter , what ’ s the matter , Henery ? ” said Joseph , starting back . “ What ’ s a-brewing , Henery ? ” asked Jacob and Mark Clark . “ Baily Pennyways—Baily Pennyways—I said so ; yes , I said so ! ” “ What , found out stealing anything ? ” “ Stealing it is . The news is , that after Miss Everdene got home she went out again to see all was safe , as she usually do , and coming in found Baily Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a bushel of barley . She fleed at him like a cat—never such a tomboy as she is—of course I speak with closed doors ? ” “ You do—you do , Henery. ” “ She fleed at him , and , to cut a long story short , he owned to having carried off five sack altogether , upon her promising not to persecute him . Well , he ’ s turned out neck and crop , and my question is , who ’ s going to be baily now ? ” The question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink there and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside . Before he had replaced it on the table , in came the young man , Susan Tall ’ s husband , in a still greater hurry . “ Have ye heard the news that ’ s all over parish ? ” “ About Baily Pennyways ? ” “ But besides that ? ” “ No—not a morsel of it ! ” they replied , looking into the very midst of Laban Tall as if to meet his words half-way down his throat . “ What a night of horrors ! ” murmured Joseph Poorgrass , waving his hands spasmodically . “ I ’ ve had the news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a murder , and I ’ ve seen a magpie all alone ! ” “ Fanny Robin—Miss Everdene ’ s youngest servant—can ’ t be found . They ’ ve been wanting to lock up the door these two hours , but she isn ’ t come in . And they don ’ t know what to do about going to bed for fear of locking her out . They wouldn ’ t be so concerned if she hadn ’ t been noticed in such low spirits these last few days , and Maryann d ’ think the beginning of a crowner ’ s inquest has happened to the poor girl. ” “ Oh— ’ tis burned— ’ tis burned ! ” came from Joseph Poorgrass ’ s dry lips . “ No— ’ tis drowned ! ” said Tall . “ Or ’ tis her father ’ s razor ! ” suggested Billy Smallbury , with a vivid sense of detail . “ Well—Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two of us before we go to bed . What with this trouble about the baily , and now about the girl , mis ’ ess is almost wild. ” They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse , excepting the old maltster , whom neither news , fire , rain , nor thunder could draw from his hole . There , as the others ’ footsteps died away he sat down again and continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red , bleared eyes . From the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba ’ s head and shoulders , robed in mystic white , were dimly seen extended into the air . “ Are any of my men among you ? ” she said anxiously . “ Yes , ma ’ am , several , ” said Susan Tall ’ s husband . “ To-morrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in the villages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin . Do it quietly ; there is no reason for alarm as yet . She must have left whilst we were all at the fire. ” “ I beg yer pardon , but had she any young man courting her in the parish , ma ’ am ? ” asked Jacob Smallbury . “ I don ’ t know , ” said Bathsheba . “ I ’ ve never heard of any such thing , ma ’ am , ” said two or three . “ It is hardly likely , either , ” continued Bathsheba . “ For any lover of hers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable lad . The most mysterious matter connected with her absence—indeed , the only thing which gives me serious alarm—is that she was seen to go out of the house by Maryann with only her indoor working gown on—not even a bonnet. ” “ And you mean , ma ’ am , excusing my words , that a young woman would hardly go to see her young man without dressing up , ” said Jacob , turning his mental vision upon past experiences . “ That ’ s true—she would not , ma ’ am. ” “ She had , I think , a bundle , though I couldn ’ t see very well , ” said a female voice from another window , which seemed that of Maryann . “ But she had no young man about here . Hers lives in Casterbridge , and I believe he ’ s a soldier. ” “ Do you know his name ? ” Bathsheba said . “ No , mistress ; she was very close about it. ” “ Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to Casterbridge barracks , ” said William Smallbury . “ Very well ; if she doesn ’ t return to-morrow , mind you go there and try to discover which man it is , and see him . I feel more responsible than I should if she had had any friends or relations alive . I do hope she has come to no harm through a man of that kind .... And then there ’ s this disgraceful affair of the bailiff—but I can ’ t speak of him now. ” Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did not think it worth while to dwell upon any particular one . “ Do as I told you , then , ” she said in conclusion , closing the casement . “ Ay , ay , mistress ; we will , ” they replied , and moved away . That night at Coggan ’ s , Gabriel Oak , beneath the screen of closed eyelids , was busy with fancies , and full of movement , like a river flowing rapidly under its ice . Night had always been the time at which he saw Bathsheba most vividly , and through the slow hours of shadow he tenderly regarded her image now . It is rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will compensate for the pain of sleeplessness , but they possibly did with Oak to-night , for the delight of merely seeing her effaced for the time his perception of the great difference between seeing and possessing . He also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from Norcombe . _The Young Man ’ s Best Companion_ , _The Farrier ’ s Sure Guide_ , _The Veterinary Surgeon_ , _Paradise Lost_ , _The Pilgrim ’ s Progress_ , _Robinson Crusoe_ , Ash ’ s _Dictionary_ , and Walkingame ’ s _Arithmetic_ , constituted his library ; and though a limited series , it was one from which he had acquired more sound information by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities has done from a furlong of laden shelves . CHAPTER IX THE HOMESTEAD—A VISITOR—HALF-CONFIDENCES By daylight , the bower of Oak ’ s new-found mistress , Bathsheba Everdene , presented itself as a hoary building , of the early stage of Classic Renaissance as regards its architecture , and of a proportion which told at a glance that , as is so frequently the case , it had once been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it , now altogether effaced as a distinct property , and merged in the vast tract of a non-resident landlord , which comprised several such modest demesnes . Fluted pilasters , worked from the solid stone , decorated its front , and above the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar , some coped gables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their Gothic extraction . Soft brown mosses , like faded velveteen , formed cushions upon the stone tiling , and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings . A gravel walk leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted at the sides with",Far From The Madding Crowd
Charles Dickens,"hair and oily countenance -- placed the reins in Mr. Pickwick ’ s left hand ; and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right . ‘ Wo-o ! ’ cried Mr. Pickwick , as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee-room window . ‘ Wo-o ! ’ echoed Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass , from the bin . ‘ Only his playfulness , gen ’ lm ’ n , ’ said the head hostler encouragingly ; ‘ jist kitch hold on him , Villiam. ’ The deputy restrained the animal ’ s impetuosity , and the principal ran to assist Mr. Winkle in mounting . ‘ T ’ other side , sir , if you please. ’ ‘ Blowed if the gen ’ lm ’ n worn ’ t a-gettin ’ up on the wrong side , ’ whispered a grinning post-boy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter . Mr. Winkle , thus instructed , climbed into his saddle , with about as much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a first-rate man-of-war . ‘ All right ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick , with an inward presentiment that it was all wrong . ‘ All right , ’ replied Mr. Winkle faintly . ‘ Let ‘ em go , ’ cried the hostler. -- ‘ Hold him in , sir ; ’ and away went the chaise , and the saddle-horse , with Mr. Pickwick on the box of the one , and Mr. Winkle on the back of the other , to the delight and gratification of the whole inn-yard . ‘ What makes him go sideways ? ’ said Mr. Snodgrass in the bin , to Mr. Winkle in the saddle . ‘ I can ’ t imagine , ’ replied Mr. Winkle . His horse was drifting up the street in the most mysterious manner -- side first , with his head towards one side of the way , and his tail towards the other . Mr. Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other particular , the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the management of the animal attached to the chaise , who displayed various peculiarities , highly interesting to a bystander , but by no means equally amusing to any one seated behind him . Besides constantly jerking his head up , in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable manner , and tugging at the reins to an extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty for Mr. Pickwick to hold them , he had a singular propensity for darting suddenly every now and then to the side of the road , then stopping short , and then rushing forward for some minutes , at a speed which it was wholly impossible to control . ‘ What _can_ he mean by this ? ’ said Mr. Snodgrass , when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time . ‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied Mr. Tupman ; ‘ it looks very like shying , don ’ t it ? ’ Mr. Snodgrass was about to reply , when he was interrupted by a shout from Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Woo ! ’ said that gentleman ; ‘ I have dropped my whip. ’ ‘ Winkle , ’ said Mr. Snodgrass , as the equestrian came trotting up on the tall horse , with his hat over his ears , and shaking all over , as if he would shake to pieces , with the violence of the exercise , ‘ pick up the whip , there ’ s a good fellow. ’ Mr. Winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall horse till he was black in the face ; and having at length succeeded in stopping him , dismounted , handed the whip to Mr. Pickwick , and grasping the reins , prepared to remount . Now whether the tall horse , in the natural playfulness of his disposition , was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with Mr. Winkle , or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one , are points upon which , of course , we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion . By whatever motives the animal was actuated , certain it is that Mr. Winkle had no sooner touched the reins , than he slipped them over his head , and darted backwards to their full length . ‘ Poor fellow , ’ said Mr. Winkle soothingly -- ‘ poor fellow -- good old horse. ’ The ‘ poor fellow ’ was proof against flattery ; the more Mr. Winkle tried to get nearer him , the more he sidled away ; and , notwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling , there were Mr. Winkle and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes , at the end of which time each was at precisely the same distance from the other as when they first commenced -- an unsatisfactory sort of thing under any circumstances , but particularly so in a lonely road , where no assistance can be procured . ‘ What am I to do ? ’ shouted Mr. Winkle , after the dodging had been prolonged for a considerable time . ‘ What am I to do ? I can ’ t get on him. ’ ‘ You had better lead him till we come to a turnpike , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick from the chaise . ‘ But he won ’ t come ! ’ roared Mr. Winkle . ‘ Do come and hold him. ’ Mr. Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity : he threw the reins on the horse ’ s back , and having descended from his seat , carefully drew the chaise into the hedge , lest anything should come along the road , and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion , leaving Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the vehicle . The horse no sooner beheld Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand , than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged , for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character , that it at once drew Mr. Winkle , who was still at the end of the bridle , at a rather quicker rate than fast walking , in the direction from which they had just come . Mr. Pickwick ran to his assistance , but the faster Mr. Pickwick ran forward , the faster the horse ran backward . There was a great scraping of feet , and kicking up of the dust ; and at last Mr. Winkle , his arms being nearly pulled out of their sockets , fairly let go his hold . The horse paused , stared , shook his head , turned round , and quietly trotted home to Rochester , leaving Mr. Winkle and Mr. Pickwick gazing on each other with countenances of blank dismay . A rattling noise at a little distance attracted their attention . They looked up . ‘ Bless my soul ! ’ exclaimed the agonised Mr. Pickwick ; ‘ there ’ s the other horse running away ! ’ It was but too true . The animal was startled by the noise , and the reins were on his back . The results may be guessed . He tore off with the four- wheeled chaise behind him , and Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the four- wheeled chaise . The heat was a short one . Mr. Tupman threw himself into the hedge , Mr. Snodgrass followed his example , the horse dashed the four -- wheeled chaise against a wooden bridge , separated the wheels from the body , and the bin from the perch ; and finally stood stock still to gaze upon the ruin he had made . The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset -- a process which gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained no injury , beyond sundry rents in their garments , and various lacerations from the brambles . The next thing to be done was to unharness the horse . This complicated process having been effected , the party walked slowly forward , leading the horse among them , and abandoning the chaise to its fate . An hour ’ s walk brought the travellers to a little road-side public- house , with two elm-trees , a horse trough , and a signpost , in front ; one or two deformed hay-ricks behind , a kitchen garden at the side , and rotten sheds and mouldering outhouses jumbled in strange confusion all about it . A red-headed man was working in the garden ; and to him Mr. Pickwick called lustily , ‘ Hollo there ! ’ The red-headed man raised his body , shaded his eyes with his hand , and stared , long and coolly , at Mr. Pickwick and his companions . ‘ Hollo there ! ’ repeated Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Hollo ! ’ was the red-headed man ’ s reply . ‘ How far is it to Dingley Dell ? ’ ‘ Better er seven mile. ’ ‘ Is it a good road ? ’ ‘ No , ‘ tain ’ t. ’ Having uttered this brief reply , and apparently satisfied himself with another scrutiny , the red-headed man resumed his work . ‘ We want to put this horse up here , ’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘ I suppose we can , can ’ t we ? ’ Want to put that ere horse up , do ee ? ’ repeated the red-headed man , leaning on his spade . ‘ Of course , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick , who had by this time advanced , horse in hand , to the garden rails . ‘ Missus ’ -- roared the man with the red head , emerging from the garden , and looking very hard at the horse -- ‘ missus ! ’ A tall , bony woman -- straight all the way down -- in a coarse , blue pelisse , with the waist an inch or two below her arm-pits , responded to the call . ‘ Can we put this horse up here , my good woman ? ’ said Mr. Tupman , advancing , and speaking in his most seductive tones . The woman looked very hard at the whole party ; and the red-headed man whispered something in her ear . ‘ No , ’ replied the woman , after a little consideration , ‘ I ’ m afeerd on it. ’ ‘ Afraid ! ’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , ‘ what ’ s the woman afraid of ? ’ ‘ It got us in trouble last time , ’ said the woman , turning into the house ; ‘ I woan ’ t have nothin ’ to say to ‘ un. ’ ‘ Most extraordinary thing I have ever met with in my life , ’ said the astonished Mr. Pickwick . ‘ I -- I -- really believe , ’ whispered Mr. Winkle , as his friends gathered round him , ‘ that they think we have come by this horse in some dishonest manner. ’ ‘ What ! ’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , in a storm of indignation . Mr. Winkle modestly repeated his suggestion . ‘ Hollo , you fellow , ’ said the angry Mr. Pickwick , ‘ do you think we stole the horse ? ’ ‘ I ’ m sure ye did , ’ replied the red-headed man , with a grin which agitated his countenance from one auricular organ to the other . Saying which he turned into the house and banged the door after him . ‘ It ’ s like a dream , ’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick , ‘ a hideous dream . The idea of a man ’ s walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he can ’ t get rid of ! ’ The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away , with the tall quadruped , for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust , following slowly at their heels . It was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their four-footed companion turned into the lane leading to Manor Farm ; and even when they were so near their place of destination , the pleasure they would otherwise have experienced was materially damped as they reflected on the singularity of their appearance , and the absurdity of their situation . Torn clothes , lacerated faces , dusty shoes , exhausted looks , and , above all , the horse . Oh , how Mr. Pickwick cursed that horse : he had eyed the noble animal from time to time with looks expressive of hatred and revenge ; more than once he had calculated the probable amount of the expense he would incur by cutting his throat ; and now the temptation to destroy him , or to cast him loose upon the world , rushed upon his mind with tenfold force . He was roused from a meditation on these dire imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn of the lane . It was Mr. Wardle , and his faithful attendant , the fat boy . ‘ Why , where have you been ? ’ said the hospitable old gentleman ; ‘ I ’ ve been waiting for you all day . Well , you _do_ look tired . What ! Scratches ! Not hurt , I hope -- eh ? Well , I _am_ glad to hear that -- very . So you ’ ve been spilt , eh ? Never mind . Common accident in these parts . Joe -- he ’ s asleep again ! -- Joe , take that horse from the gentlemen , and lead it into the stable. ’ The fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal ; and the old gentleman , condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the day ’ s adventures as they thought proper to communicate , led the way to the kitchen . ‘ We ’ ll have you put to rights here , ’ said the old gentleman , ‘ and then I ’ ll introduce you to the people in the parlour . Emma , bring out the cherry brandy ; now , Jane , a needle and thread here ; towels and water , Mary . Come , girls , bustle about. ’ Three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different articles in requisition , while a couple of large-headed , circular- visaged males rose from their seats in the chimney-corner ( for although it was a May evening their attachment to the wood fire appeared as cordial as if it were Christmas ) , and dived into some obscure recesses , from which they speedily produced a bottle of blacking , and some half- dozen brushes . ‘ Bustle ! ’ said the old gentleman again , but the admonition was quite unnecessary , for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy , and another brought in the towels , and one of the men suddenly seizing Mr. Pickwick by the leg , at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance , brushed away at his boot till his corns were red-hot ; while the other shampooed Mr. Winkle with a heavy clothes-brush , indulging , during the operation , in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in rubbing down a horse . Mr. Snodgrass , having concluded his ablutions , took a survey of the room , while standing with his back to the fire , sipping his cherry brandy with heartfelt satisfaction . He describes it as a large apartment , with a red brick floor and a capacious chimney ; the ceiling garnished with hams , sides of bacon , and ropes of onions . The walls were decorated with several hunting-whips , two or three bridles , a saddle , and an old rusty blunderbuss , with an inscription below it , intimating that it was ‘ Loaded ’ -- as it had been , on the same authority , for half a century at least . An old eight-day clock , of solemn and sedate demeanour , ticked gravely in one corner ; and a silver watch , of equal antiquity , dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser . ‘ Ready ? ’ said the old gentleman inquiringly , when his guests had been washed , mended , brushed , and brandied . ‘ Quite , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Come along , then ; ’ and the party having traversed several dark passages , and being joined by Mr. Tupman , who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss from Emma , for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and scratchings , arrived at the parlour door . ‘ Welcome , ’ said their hospitable host , throwing it open and stepping forward to announce them , ‘ welcome , gentlemen , to Manor Farm. ’ CHAPTER VI . AN OLD-FASHIONED CARD-PARTY -- THE CLERGYMAN ’ S VERSES -- THE STORY OF THE CONVICT ’ S RETURN Several guests who were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet Mr. Pickwick and his friends upon their entrance ; and during the performance of the ceremony of introduction , with all due formalities , Mr. Pickwick had leisure to observe the appearance , and speculate upon the characters and pursuits , of the persons by whom he was surrounded -- a habit in which he , in common with many other great men , delighted to indulge . A very old lady , in a lofty cap and faded silk gown -- no less a personage than Mr. Wardle ’ s mother -- occupied the post of honour on the right-hand corner of the chimney-piece ; and various certificates of her having been brought up in the way she should go when young , and of her not having departed from it when old , ornamented the walls , in the form of samplers of ancient date , worsted landscapes of equal antiquity , and crimson silk tea-kettle holders of a more modern period . The aunt , the two young ladies , and Mr. Wardle , each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady , crowded round her easy-chair , one holding her ear-trumpet , another an orange , and a third a smelling- bottle , while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support . On the opposite side sat a bald-headed old gentleman , with a good-humoured , benevolent face -- the clergyman of Dingley Dell ; and next him sat his wife , a stout , blooming old lady , who looked as if she were well skilled , not only in the art and mystery of manufacturing home-made cordials greatly to other people ’ s satisfaction , but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own . A little hard-headed , Ripstone pippin-faced man , was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner ; and two or three more old gentlemen , and two or three more old ladies , sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs , staring very hard at Mr. Pickwick and his fellow-voyagers . ‘ Mr . Pickwick , mother , ’ said Mr. Wardle , at the very top of his voice . ‘ Ah ! ’ said the old lady , shaking her head ; ‘ I can ’ t hear you. ’ ‘ Mr . Pickwick , grandma ! ’ screamed both the young ladies together . ‘ Ah ! ’ exclaimed the old lady . ‘ Well , it don ’ t much matter . He don ’ t care for an old ‘ ooman like me , I dare say. ’ ‘ I assure you , ma ’ am , ’ said Mr. Pickwick , grasping the old lady ’ s hand , and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance -- ‘ I assure you , ma ’ am , that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family , and looking so young and well. ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ said the old lady , after a short pause : ‘ it ’ s all very fine , I dare say ; but I can ’ t hear him. ’ ‘ Grandma ’ s rather put out now , ’ said Miss Isabella Wardle , in a low tone ; ‘ but she ’ ll talk to you presently. ’ Mr. Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age , and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle . ‘ Delightful situation this , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Delightful ! ’ echoed Messrs. Snodgrass , Tupman , and Winkle . ‘ Well , I think it is , ’ said Mr. Wardle . ‘ There ain ’ t a better spot o ’ ground in all Kent , sir , ’ said the hard- headed man with the pippin -- face ; ‘ there ain ’ t indeed , sir -- I ’ m sure there ain ’ t , Sir. ’ The hard-headed man looked triumphantly round , as if he had been very much contradicted by somebody , but had got the better of him at last . ‘ There ain ’ t a better spot o ’ ground in all Kent , ’ said the hard-headed man again , after a pause . ‘ ’ Cept Mullins ’ s Meadows , ’ observed the fat man solemnly . ‘ Mullins ’ s Meadows ! ’ ejaculated the other , with profound contempt . ‘ Ah , Mullins ’ s Meadows , ’ repeated the fat man . ‘ Reg ’ lar good land that , ’ interposed another fat man . ‘ And so it is , sure-ly , ’ said a third fat man . ‘ Everybody knows that , ’ said the corpulent host . The hard-headed man looked dubiously round , but finding himself in a minority , assumed a compassionate air and said no more . ‘ What are they talking about ? ’ inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters , in a very audible voice ; for , like many deaf people , she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself . ‘ About the land , grandma. ’ ‘ What about the land ? -- Nothing the matter , is there ? ’ ‘ No , no . Mr. Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins ’ s Meadows. ’ ‘ How should he know anything about it ? ’ inquired the old lady indignantly . ‘ Miller ’ s a conceited coxcomb , and you may tell him I said so. ’ Saying which , the old lady , quite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper , drew herself up , and looked carving-knives at the hard- headed delinquent . ‘ Come , come , ’ said the bustling host , with a natural anxiety to change the conversation , ‘ what say you to a rubber , Mr. Pickwick ? ’ ‘ I should like it of all things , ’ replied that gentleman ; ‘ but pray don ’ t make up one on my account. ’ ‘ Oh , I assure you , mother ’ s very fond of a rubber , ’ said Mr. Wardle ; ‘ ain ’ t you , mother ? ’ The old lady , who was much less deaf on this subject than on any other , replied in the affirmative . ‘ Joe , Joe ! ’ said the gentleman ; ‘ Joe -- damn that -- oh , here he is ; put out the card-tables. ’ The lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out two card-tables ; the one for Pope Joan , and the other for whist . The whist-players were Mr. Pickwick and the old lady , Mr. Miller and the fat gentleman . The round game comprised the rest of the company . The rubber was conducted with all that gravity of deportment and sedateness of demeanour which befit the pursuit entitled ‘ whist ’ -- a solemn observance , to which , as it appears to us , the title of ‘ game ’ has been very irreverently and ignominiously applied . The round-game table , on the other hand , was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the contemplations of Mr. Miller , who , not being quite so much absorbed as he ought to have been , contrived to commit various high crimes and misdemeanours , which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very great extent , and called forth the good-humour of the old lady in a proportionate degree . ‘ There ! ’ said the criminal Miller triumphantly , as he took up the odd trick at the conclusion of a hand ; ‘ that could not have been played better , I flatter myself ; impossible to have made another trick ! ’ ‘ Miller ought to have trumped the diamond , oughtn ’ t he , Sir ? ’ said the old lady . Mr. Pickwick nodded assent . ‘ Ought I , though ? ’ said the unfortunate , with a doubtful appeal to his partner . ‘ You ought , Sir , ’ said the fat gentleman , in an awful voice . ‘ Very sorry , ’ said the crestfallen Miller . ‘ Much use that , ’ growled the fat gentleman . ‘ Two by honours -- makes us eight , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Another hand . ‘ Can you one ? ’ inquired the old lady . ‘ I can , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Double , single , and the rub. ’ ‘ Never was such luck , ’ said Mr. Miller . ‘ Never was such cards , ’ said the fat gentleman . A solemn silence ; Mr. Pickwick humorous , the old lady serious , the fat gentleman captious , and Mr. Miller timorous . ‘ Another double , ’ said the old lady , triumphantly making a memorandum of the circumstance , by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under the candlestick . ‘ A double , sir , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Quite aware of the fact , Sir , ’ replied the fat gentleman sharply . Another game , with a similar result , was followed by a revoke from the unlucky Miller ; on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game , when he retired into a corner , and remained perfectly mute for one hour and twenty-seven minutes ; at the end of which time he emerged from his retirement , and offered Mr. Pickwick a pinch of snuff with the air of a man who had made up his mind to a Christian forgiveness of injuries sustained . The old lady ’ s hearing decidedly improved and the unlucky Miller felt as much out of his element as a dolphin in a sentry-box . Meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily . Isabella Wardle and Mr. Trundle ‘ went partners , ’ and Emily Wardle and Mr. Snodgrass did the same ; and even Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint- stock company of fish and flattery . Old Mr. Wardle was in the very height of his jollity ; and he was so funny in his management of the board , and the old ladies were so sharp after their winnings , that the whole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter . There was one old lady who always had about half a dozen cards to pay for , at which everybody laughed , regularly every round ; and when the old lady looked cross at having to pay , they laughed louder than ever ; on which the old lady ’ s face gradually brightened up , till at last she laughed louder than any of them , Then , when the spinster aunt got ‘ matrimony , ’ the young ladies laughed afresh , and the Spinster aunt seemed disposed to be pettish ; till , feeling Mr. Tupman squeezing her hand under the table , she brightened up too , and looked rather knowing , as if matrimony in reality were not quite so far off as some people thought for ; whereupon everybody laughed again , and especially old Mr. Wardle , who enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest . As to Mr. Snodgrass , he did nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his partner ’ s ear , which made one old gentleman facetiously sly , about partnerships at cards and partnerships for life , and caused the aforesaid old gentleman to make some remarks thereupon , accompanied with divers winks and chuckles , which made the company very merry and the old gentleman ’ s wife especially so . And Mr. Winkle came out with jokes which are very well known in town , but are not all known in the country ; and as everybody laughed at them very heartily , and said they were very capital , Mr. Winkle was in a state of great honour and glory . And the benevolent clergyman looked pleasantly on ; for the happy faces which surrounded the table made the good old man feel happy too ; and though the merriment was rather boisterous , still it came from the heart and not from the lips ; and this is the right sort of merriment , after all . The evening glided swiftly away , in these cheerful recreations ; and when the substantial though homely supper had been despatched , and the little party formed a social circle round the fire , Mr. Pickwick thought he had never felt so happy in his life , and at no time so much disposed to enjoy , and make the most of , the passing moment . ‘ Now this , ’ said the hospitable host , who was sitting in great state next the old lady ’ s arm-chair , with her hand fast clasped in his -- ‘ this is just what I like -- the happiest moments of my life have been passed at this old fireside ; and I am so attached to it , that I keep up a blazing fire here every evening , until it actually grows too hot to bear it . Why , my poor old mother , here , used to sit before this fireplace upon that little stool when she was a girl ; didn ’ t you , mother ? ’ The tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old times and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled , stole down the old lady ’ s face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile . ‘ You must excuse my talking about this old place , Mr. Pickwick , ’ resumed the host , after a short pause , ‘ for I love it dearly , and know no other- -the old houses and fields seem like living friends to me ; and so does our little church with the ivy , about which , by the bye , our excellent friend there made a song when he first came amongst us . Mr. Snodgrass , have you anything in your glass ? ’ ‘ Plenty , thank you , ’ replied that gentleman , whose poetic curiosity had been greatly excited by the last observation of his entertainer . ‘ I beg your pardon , but you were talking about the song of the Ivy. ’ ‘ You must ask our friend opposite about that , ’ said the host knowingly , indicating the clergyman by a nod of his head . ‘ May I say that I should like to hear you repeat it , sir ? ’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘ Why , really , ’ replied the clergyman , ‘ it ’ s a very slight affair ; and the only excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is , that I was a young man at the time . Such as it is , however , you shall hear it , if you wish. ’ A murmur of curiosity was of course the reply ; and the old gentleman proceeded to recite , with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife , the lines in question . ‘ I call them , ’ said he , THE IVY GREEN Oh , a dainty plant is the Ivy green , That creepeth o ’ er ruins old ! Of right choice food are his meals , I ween , In his cell so lone and cold . The wall must be crumbled , the stone decayed , To pleasure his dainty whim ; And the mouldering dust that years have made , Is a merry meal for him . Creeping where no life is seen , A rare old plant is the Ivy green . Fast he stealeth on , though he wears no wings , And a staunch old heart has he . How closely he twineth , how tight he clings To his friend the huge Oak Tree ! And slily he traileth along the ground , And his leaves he gently waves , As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men ’ s graves . Creeping where grim death has been , A rare old plant is the Ivy green . Whole ages have fled and their works decayed , And nations have scattered been ; But the stout old Ivy shall never fade , From its hale and hearty green . The brave old plant in its lonely days , Shall fatten upon the past ; For the stateliest building man can raise , Is the Ivy ’ s food at last . Creeping on where time has been , A rare old plant is the Ivy green . While the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time , to enable Mr. Snodgrass to note them down , Mr. Pickwick perused the lineaments of his face with an expression of great interest . The old gentleman having concluded his dictation , and Mr. Snodgrass having returned his note-book to his pocket , Mr. Pickwick said -- ‘ Excuse me , sir , for making the remark on so short an acquaintance ; but a gentleman like yourself can not fail , I should think , to have observed many scenes and incidents worth recording , in the course of your experience as a minister of the Gospel. ’ ‘ I have witnessed some certainly , ’ replied the old gentleman , ‘ but the incidents and characters have been of a homely and ordinary nature , my sphere of action being so very limited. ’ ‘ You did make some notes , I think , about John Edmunds , did you not ? ’ inquired Mr. Wardle , who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out , for the edification of his new visitors . The old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent , and was proceeding to change the subject , when Mr. Pickwick said -- ‘ I beg your pardon , sir , but pray , if I may venture to inquire , who was John Edmunds ? ’ ‘ The very thing I was about to ask , ’ said Mr. Snodgrass eagerly . ‘ You are fairly in for it , ’ said the jolly host . ‘ You must satisfy the curiosity of these gentlemen , sooner or later ; so you had better take advantage of this favourable opportunity , and do so at once. ’ The old gentleman smiled good-humouredly as he drew his chair forward -- the remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together , especially Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt , who were possibly rather hard of hearing ; and the old lady ’ s ear-trumpet having been duly adjusted , and Mr. Miller ( who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verses ) roused from his slumbers by an admonitory pinch , administered beneath the table by his ex-partner the solemn fat man , the old gentleman , without further preface , commenced the following tale , to which we have taken the liberty of prefixing the title of THE CONVICT ’ S RETURN ‘ When I first settled in this village , ’ said the old gentleman , ‘ which is now just five-and-twenty years ago , the most notorious person among my parishioners was a man of the name of Edmunds , who leased a small farm near this spot . He was a morose , savage-hearted , bad man ; idle and dissolute in his habits ; cruel and ferocious in his disposition . Beyond the few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time in the fields , or sotted in the ale-house , he had not a single friend or acquaintance ; no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared , and every one detested -- and Edmunds was shunned by all . ‘ This man had a wife and one son , who , when I first came here , was about twelve years old . Of the acuteness of that woman ’ s sufferings , of the gentle and enduring manner in which she bore them , of the agony of solicitude with which she reared that boy , no one can form an adequate conception . Heaven forgive me the supposition , if it be an uncharitable one , but I do firmly and in my soul believe , that the man systematically tried for many years to break her heart ; but she bore it all for her child ’ s sake , and , however strange it may seem to many , for his father ’ s too ; for brute as he was , and cruelly as he had treated her , she had loved him once ; and the recollection of what he had been to her , awakened feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her bosom , to which all God ’ s creatures , but women , are strangers . ‘ They were poor -- they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses ; but the woman ’ s unceasing and unwearied exertions , early and late , morning , noon , and night , kept them above actual want . These exertions were but ill repaid . People who passed the spot in the evening -- sometimes at a late hour of the night -- reported that they had heard the moans and sobs of a woman in distress , and the sound of blows ; and more than once , when it was past midnight , the boy knocked softly at the door of a neighbour ’ s house , whither he had been sent , to escape the drunken fury of his unnatural father . ‘ During the whole of this time , and when the poor creature often bore about her marks of ill-usage and violence which she could not wholly conceal , she was a constant attendant at our little church . Regularly every Sunday , morning and afternoon , she occupied the same seat with the boy at her side ; and though they were both poorly dressed -- much more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station -- they were always neat and clean . Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for “ poor Mrs. Edmunds ” ; and sometimes , when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elm-trees which leads to the church porch , or lingered behind to gaze with a mother ’ s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy , as he sported before her with some little companions , her careworn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude ; and she would look , if not cheerful and happy , at least tranquil and contented . ‘ Five or six years passed away ; the boy had become a robust and well- grown youth . The time that had strengthened the child ’ s slight frame and knit his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother ’ s form , and enfeebled her steps ; but the arm that should have supported her was no longer locked in hers ; the face that should have cheered her , no more looked upon her own . She occupied her old seat , but there was a vacant one beside her . The Bible was kept as carefully as ever , the places were found and folded down as they used to be : but there was no one to read it with her ; and the tears fell thick and fast upon the book , and blotted the words from her eyes . Neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of old , but she shunned their greetings with averted head . There was no lingering among the old elm-trees now -- no cheering anticipations of happiness yet in store . The desolate woman drew her bonnet closer over her face , and walked hurriedly away . ‘ Shall I tell you that the young man , who , looking back to the earliest of his childhood ’ s days to which memory and consciousness extended , and carrying his recollection down to that moment , could remember nothing which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary privations suffered by his mother for his sake , with ill-usage , and insult , and violence , and all endured for him -- shall I tell you , that he , with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart , and a sullen , wilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him , had linked himself with depraved and abandoned men , and was madly pursuing a headlong career , which must bring death to him , and shame to her ? Alas for human nature ! You have anticipated it long since . ‘ The measure of the unhappy woman ’ s misery and misfortune was about to be completed . Numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood ; the perpetrators remained undiscovered , and their boldness increased . A robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of pursuit , and a strictness of search , they had not calculated on . Young Edmunds was suspected , with three companions . He was apprehended -- committed -- tried -- condemned -- to die . ‘ The wild and piercing shriek from a woman ’ s voice , which resounded through the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced , rings in my ears at this moment . That cry struck a terror to the culprit ’ s heart , which trial , condemnation -- the approach of death itself , had failed to awaken . The lips which had been compressed in dogged sullenness throughout , quivered and parted involuntarily ; the face turned ashy pale as the cold perspiration broke forth from every pore ; the sturdy limbs of the felon trembled , and he staggered in the dock . ‘ In the first transports of her mental anguish , the suffering mother threw herself on her knees at my feet , and fervently sought the Almighty Being who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her from a world of woe and misery , and to spare the life of her only child . A burst of grief , and a violent struggle , such as I hope I may never have to witness again , succeeded . I knew that her heart was breaking from that hour ; but I never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips . ‘ It was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prison-yard from day to day , eagerly and fervently attempting , by affection and entreaty , to soften the hard heart of her obdurate son . It was in vain . He remained moody , obstinate , and unmoved . Not even the unlooked-for commutation of his sentence to transportation for fourteen years , softened for an instant the sullen hardihood of his demeanour . ‘ But the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld her , was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity . She fell sick . She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son once more , but her strength failed her , and she sank powerless on the ground . ‘ And now the boasted coldness and indifference of the young man were tested indeed ; and the retribution that fell heavily upon him nearly drove him mad . A day passed away and his mother was not there ; another flew by , and she came not near him ; a third evening arrived , and yet he had not seen her -- , and in four-and-twenty hours he was to be separated from her , perhaps for ever . Oh ! how the long-forgotten thoughts of former days rushed upon his mind , as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard -- as if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying -- and how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him , when he heard the truth ! His mother , the only parent he had ever known , lay ill -- it might be , dying -- within one mile of the ground he stood on ; were he free and unfettered , a few minutes would place him by her side . He rushed to the gate , and grasping the iron rails with the energy of desperation , shook it till it rang again , and threw himself against the thick wall as if to force a passage through the stone ; but the strong building mocked his feeble efforts , and he beat his hands together and wept like a child . ‘ I bore the mother ’ s forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison ; and I carried the solemn assurance of repentance , and his fervent supplication for pardon , to her sick-bed . I heard , with pity and compassion , the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned ; but I knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination , his mother would be no longer of this world . ‘ He was removed by night . A few weeks afterwards the poor woman ’ s soul took its flight , I confidently hope , and solemnly believe , to a place of eternal happiness and rest . I performed the burial service over her remains . She lies in our little churchyard . There is no stone at her grave ’ s head . Her sorrows were known to man ; her virtues to God . ‘ It had been arranged previously to the convict ’ s departure , that he should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission , and that the letter should be addressed to me . The father had positively refused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension ; and it was a matter of indifference to him whether he lived or died . Many years passed over without any intelligence of him ; and when more than half his term of transportation had expired , and I had received no letter , I concluded him to be dead , as , indeed , I almost hoped he might be . ‘ Edmunds , however , had been sent a considerable distance up the country on his arrival at the settlement ; and to this circumstance , perhaps , may be attributed the fact , that though several letters were despatched , none of them ever reached my hands . He remained in the same place during the whole fourteen years . At the expiration of the term , steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother , he made his way back to England amidst innumerable difficulties , and returned , on foot , to his native place . ‘ On a fine Sunday evening , in the month of August , John Edmunds set foot in the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years before . His nearest way lay through the churchyard . The man ’ s heart swelled as he crossed the stile . The tall old elms , through whose branches the declining sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon the shady part , awakened the associations of his earliest days . He pictured himself as he was then , clinging to his mother ’ s hand , and walking peacefully to church . He remembered how he used to look up into her pale face ; and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features -- tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him , and made him weep too , although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were . He thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish playfellow , looking back , ever and again , to catch his mother ’ s smile , or hear her gentle voice ; and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory , and words of kindness unrequited , and warnings despised , and promises broken , thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him , and he could bear it no longer . ‘ He entered the church . The evening service was concluded and the congregation had dispersed , but it was not yet closed . His steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound , and he almost feared to be alone , it was so still and quiet . He looked round him . Nothing was changed . The place seemed smaller than it used to be ; but there were the old monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times ; the little pulpit with its faded cushion ; the Communion table before which he had so often repeated the Commandments he had reverenced as a child , and forgotten as a man . He approached the old seat ; it looked cold and desolate . The cushion had been removed , and the Bible was not there . Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat , or possibly she had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone . He dared not think of what he feared . A cold feeling crept over him , and he trembled violently as he turned away . ‘ An old man entered the porch just as he reached it . Edmunds started back , for he knew him well ; many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard . What would he say to the returned convict ? ‘ The old man raised his eyes to the stranger ’ s face , bade him “ good- evening , ” and walked slowly on . He had forgotten him . ‘ He walked down the hill , and through the village . The weather was warm , and the people were sitting at their doors , or strolling in their little gardens as he passed , enjoying the serenity of the evening , and their rest from labour . Many a look was turned towards him , and many a doubtful glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and shunned him . There were strange faces in almost every house ; in some he recognised the burly form of some old schoolfellow -- a boy when he last saw him -- surrounded by a troop of merry children ; in others he saw , seated in an easy-chair at a cottage door , a feeble and infirm old man , whom he only remembered as a hale and hearty labourer ; but they had all forgotten him , and he passed on unknown . ‘ The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth , casting a rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves , and lengthening the shadows of the orchard trees , as he stood before the old house -- the home of his infancy -- to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection not to be described , through long and weary years of captivity and sorrow . The paling was low , though he well remembered the time that it had seemed a high wall to him ; and he looked over into the old garden . There were more seeds and gayer flowers than there used to be , but there were the old trees still -- the very tree under which he had lain a thousand times when tired of playing in the sun , and felt the soft , mild sleep of happy boyhood steal gently upon him . There were voices within the house . He listened , but they fell strangely upon his ear ; he knew them not . They were merry too ; and he well knew that his poor old mother could not be cheerful , and he away . The door opened , and a group of little children bounded out , shouting and romping . The father , with a little boy in his arms , appeared at the door , and they crowded round him , clapping their tiny hands , and dragging him out , to join their joyous sports . The convict thought on the many times he had shrunk from his father ’ s sight in that very place . He remembered how often he had buried his trembling head beneath the bedclothes , and heard the harsh word , and the hard stripe , and his mother ’ s wailing ; and though the man sobbed aloud with agony of mind as he left the spot , his fist was clenched , and his teeth were set , in a fierce and deadly passion . ‘ And such was the return to which he had looked through the weary perspective of many years , and for which he had undergone so much suffering ! No face of welcome , no look of forgiveness , no house to receive , no hand to help him -- and this too in the old village . What was his loneliness in the wild , thick woods , where man was never seen , to this ! ‘ He felt that in the distant land of his bondage and infamy , he had thought of his native place as it was when he left it ; and not as it would be when he returned . The sad reality struck coldly at his heart , and his spirit sank within him . He had not courage to make inquiries , or to present himself to the only person who was likely to receive him with kindness and compassion . He walked slowly on ; and shunning the roadside like a guilty man , turned into a meadow he well remembered ; and covering his face with his hands , threw himself upon the grass . ‘ He had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him ; his garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new-comer ; and Edmunds raised his head . ‘ The man had moved into a sitting posture . His body was much bent , and his face was wrinkled and yellow . His dress denoted him an inmate of the workhouse : he had the appearance of being very old , but it looked more the effect of dissipation or disease , than the length of years . He was staring hard at the stranger , and though his eyes were lustreless and heavy at first , they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed expression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time , until they seemed to be starting from their sockets . Edmunds gradually raised himself to his knees , and looked more and more earnestly on the old man ’ s face . They gazed upon each other in silence . ‘ The old man was ghastly pale . He shuddered and tottered to his feet . Edmunds sprang to his . He stepped back a pace or two . Edmunds advanced . ‘ “ Let me hear you speak , ” said the convict , in a thick , broken voice . ‘ “ Stand off ! ” cried the old man , with a dreadful oath . The convict drew closer to him . ‘ “ Stand off ! ” shrieked the old man . Furious with terror , he raised his stick , and struck Edmunds a heavy blow across the face . ‘ “ Father -- devil ! ” murmured the convict between his set teeth . He rushed wildly forward , and clenched the old man by the throat -- but he was his father ; and his arm fell powerless by his side . ‘ The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit . His face turned black , the gore rushed from his mouth and nose , and dyed the grass a deep , dark red , as he staggered and fell . He had ruptured a blood-vessel , and he was a dead man before his son could raise him . ‘ In that corner of the churchyard , ’ said the old gentleman , after a silence of a few moments , ‘ in that corner of the churchyard of which I have before spoken , there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event , and who was truly contrite , penitent , and humbled , if ever man was . No one save myself knew in that man ’ s lifetime who he was , or whence he came -- it was John Edmunds , the returned convict. ’ CHAPTER VII . HOW MR. WINKLE , INSTEAD OF SHOOTING AT THE PIGEON AND KILLING THE CROW , SHOT AT THE CROW AND WOUNDED THE PIGEON ; HOW THE DINGLEY DELL CRICKET CLUB PLAYED ALL-MUGGLETON , AND HOW ALL-MUGGLETON DINED AT THE DINGLEY DELL EXPENSE ; WITH OTHER INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE MATTERS The fatiguing adventures of the day or the somniferous influence of the clergyman ’ s tale operated so strongly on the drowsy tendencies of Mr. Pickwick , that in less than five minutes after he had been shown to his comfortable bedroom he fell into a sound and dreamless sleep , from which he was only awakened by the morning sun darting his bright beams reproachfully into the apartment . Mr. Pickwick was no sluggard , and he sprang like an ardent warrior from his tent-bedstead . ‘ Pleasant , pleasant country , ’ sighed the enthusiastic gentleman , as he opened his lattice window . ‘ Who could live to gaze from day to day on bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this ? Who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the chimney-pots ; nothing redolent of Pan but pan-tiles ; no crop but stone crop ? Who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot ? Who , I ask , could endure it ? ’ and , having cross-examined solitude after the most approved precedents , at considerable length , Mr. Pickwick thrust his head out of the lattice and looked around him . The rich , sweet smell of the hay-ricks rose to his chamber window ; the hundred perfumes of the little flower-garden beneath scented the air around ; the deep-green meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened on every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air ; and the birds sang as if every sparkling drop were to them a fountain of inspiration . Mr. Pickwick fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie . ‘ Hollo ! ’ was the sound that roused him . He looked to the right , but he saw nobody ; his eyes wandered to the left , and pierced the prospect ; he stared into the sky , but he wasn ’ t wanted there ; and then he did what a common mind would have done at once -- looked into the garden , and there saw Mr. Wardle . ‘ How are you ? ’ said the good-humoured individual , out of breath with his own anticipations of pleasure. ’ Beautiful morning , ain ’ t it ? Glad to see you up so early . Make haste down , and come out . I ’ ll wait for you here. ’ Mr. Pickwick needed no second invitation . Ten minutes sufficed for the completion of his toilet , and at the expiration of that time he was by the old gentleman ’ s side . ‘ Hollo ! ’ said Mr. Pickwick in his turn , seeing that his companion was armed with a gun , and that another lay ready on the grass ; ‘ what ’ s going forward ? ’ ‘ Why , your friend and I , ’ replied the host , ‘ are going out rook-shooting before breakfast . He ’ s a very good shot , ain ’ t he ? ’ ‘ I ’ ve heard him say he ’ s a capital one , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick , ‘ but I never saw him aim at anything. ’ ‘ Well , ’ said the host , ‘ I wish he ’ d come . Joe -- Joe ! ’ The fat boy , who under the exciting influence of the morning did not appear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep , emerged from the house . ‘ Go up , and call the gentleman , and tell him he ’ ll find me and Mr. Pickwick in the rookery . Show the gentleman the way there ; d ’ ye hear ? ’ The boy departed to execute his commission ; and the host , carrying both guns like a second Robinson Crusoe , led the way from the garden . ‘ This is the place , ’ said the old gentleman , pausing after a few minutes walking , in an avenue of trees . The information was unnecessary ; for the incessant cawing of the unconscious rooks sufficiently indicated their whereabouts . The old gentleman laid one gun on the ground , and loaded the other . ‘ Here they are , ’ said Mr. Pickwick ; and , as he spoke , the forms of Mr. Tupman , Mr. Snodgrass , and Mr. Winkle appeared in the distance . The fat boy , not being quite certain which gentleman he was directed to call , had with peculiar sagacity , and to prevent the possibility of any mistake , called them all . ‘ Come along , ’ shouted the old gentleman , addressing Mr. Winkle ; ‘ a keen hand like you ought to have been up long ago , even to such poor work as this. ’ Mr. Winkle responded with a forced smile , and took up the spare gun with an expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook , impressed with a foreboding of his approaching death by violence , may be supposed to assume . It might have been keenness , but it looked remarkably like misery . The old gentleman nodded ; and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to the spot under the direction of the infant Lambert , forthwith commenced climbing up two of the trees . ‘ What are these lads for ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick abruptly . He was rather alarmed ; for he was not quite certain but that the distress of the agricultural interest , about which he had often heard a great deal , might have compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a precarious and hazardous subsistence by making marks of themselves for inexperienced sportsmen . ‘ Only to start the game , ’ replied Mr. Wardle , laughing . ‘ To what ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Why , in plain English , to frighten the rooks. ’ ‘ Oh , is that all ? ’ ‘ You are satisfied ? ’ ‘ Quite. ’ ‘ Very well . Shall I begin ? ’ ‘ If you please , ’ said Mr. Winkle , glad of any respite . ‘ Stand aside , then . Now for it. ’ The boy shouted , and shook a branch with a nest on it . Half a dozen young rooks in violent conversation , flew out to ask what the matter was . The old gentleman fired by way of reply . Down fell one bird , and off flew the others . ‘ Take him up , Joe , ’ said the old gentleman . There was a smile upon the youth ’ s face as he advanced . Indistinct visions of rook-pie floated through his imagination . He laughed as he retired with the bird -- it was a plump one . ‘ Now , Mr. Winkle , ’ said the host , reloading his own gun . ‘ Fire away. ’ Mr. Winkle advanced , and levelled his gun . Mr. Pickwick and his friends cowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rooks , which they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating barrel of their friend . There was a solemn pause -- a shout -- a flapping of wings -- a faint click . ‘ Hollo ! ’ said the old gentleman . ‘ Won ’ t it go ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Missed fire , ’ said Mr. Winkle , who was very pale -- probably from disappointment . ‘ Odd , ’ said the old gentleman , taking the gun . ‘ Never knew one of them miss fire before . Why , I don ’ t see anything of the cap. ’ Bless my soul ! ’ said Mr. Winkle , ‘ I declare I forgot the cap ! ’ The slight omission was rectified . Mr. Pickwick crouched again . Mr. Winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution ; and Mr. Tupman looked out from behind a tree . The boy shouted ; four birds flew out . Mr. Winkle fired . There was a scream as of an individual -- not a rook -- in corporal anguish . Mr. Tupman had saved the lives of innumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm . To describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible . To tell how Mr. Pickwick in the first transports of emotion called Mr. Winkle ‘ Wretch ! ’ how Mr. Tupman lay prostrate on the ground ; and how Mr. Winkle knelt horror-stricken beside him ; how Mr. Tupman called distractedly upon some feminine Christian name , and then opened first one eye , and then the other , and then fell back and shut them both -- all this would be as difficult to describe in detail , as it would be to depict the gradual recovering of the unfortunate individual , the binding up of his arm with pocket-handkerchiefs , and the conveying him back by slow degrees supported by the arms of his anxious friends . They drew near the house . The ladies were at the garden gate , waiting for their arrival and their breakfast . The spinster aunt appeared ; she smiled , and beckoned them to walk quicker . ‘ Twas evident she knew not of the disaster . Poor thing ! there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed . They approached nearer . ‘ Why , what is the matter with the little old gentleman ? ’ said Isabella Wardle . The spinster aunt heeded not the remark ; she thought it applied to Mr. Pickwick . In her eyes Tracy Tupman was a youth ; she viewed his years through a diminishing glass . ‘ Don ’ t be frightened , ’ called out the old host , fearful of alarming his daughters . The little party had crowded so completely round Mr. Tupman , that they could not yet clearly discern the nature of the accident . ‘ Don ’ t be frightened , ’ said the host . ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ screamed the ladies . ‘ Mr . Tupman has met with a little accident ; that ’ s all. ’ The spinster aunt uttered a piercing scream , burst into an hysteric laugh , and fell backwards in the arms of her nieces . ‘ Throw some cold water over her , ’ said the old gentleman . ‘ No , no , ’ murmured the spinster aunt ; ‘ I am better now . Bella , Emily -- a surgeon ! Is he wounded ? -- Is he dead ? -- Is he -- Ha , ha , ha ! ’ Here the spinster aunt burst into fit number two , of hysteric laughter interspersed with screams . ‘ Calm yourself , ’ said Mr. Tupman , affected almost to tears by this expression of sympathy with his sufferings . ‘ Dear , dear madam , calm yourself. ’ ‘ It is his voice ! ’ exclaimed the spinster aunt ; and strong symptoms of fit number three developed themselves forthwith . ‘ Do not agitate yourself , I entreat you , dearest madam , ’ said Mr. Tupman soothingly . ‘ I am very little hurt , I assure you. ’ ‘ Then you are not dead ! ’ ejaculated the hysterical lady . ‘ Oh , say you are not dead ! ’ ‘ Don ’ t be a fool , Rachael , ’ interposed Mr. Wardle , rather more roughly than was consistent with the poetic nature of the scene . ‘ What the devil ’ s the use of his saying he isn ’ t dead ? ’ ‘ No , no , I am not , ’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘ I require no assistance but yours . Let me lean on your arm. ’ He added , in a whisper , ‘ Oh , Miss Rachael ! ’ The agitated female advanced , and offered her arm . They turned into the breakfast parlour . Mr. Tracy Tupman gently pressed her hand to his lips , and sank upon the sofa . ‘ Are you faint ? ’ inquired the anxious Rachael . ‘ No , ’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘ It is nothing . I shall be better presently. ’ He closed his eyes . ‘ He sleeps , ’ murmured the spinster aunt . ( His organs of vision had been closed nearly twenty seconds . ) ‘ Dear -- dear -- Mr. Tupman ! ’ Mr. Tupman jumped up -- ‘ Oh , say those words again ! ’ he exclaimed . The lady started . ‘ Surely you did not hear them ! ’ she said bashfully . ‘ Oh , yes , I did ! ’ replied Mr. Tupman ; ‘ repeat them . If you would have me recover , repeat them. ’ Hush ! ’ said the lady . ‘ My brother. ’ Mr. Tracy Tupman resumed his former position ; and Mr. Wardle , accompanied by a surgeon , entered the room . The arm was examined , the wound dressed , and pronounced to be a very slight one ; and the minds of the company having been thus satisfied , they proceeded to satisfy their appetites with countenances to which an expression of cheerfulness was again restored . Mr. Pickwick alone was silent and reserved . Doubt and distrust were exhibited in his countenance . His confidence in Mr. Winkle had been shaken -- greatly shaken -- by the proceedings of the morning . ‘ Are you a cricketer ? ’ inquired Mr. Wardle of the marksman . At any other time , Mr. Winkle would have replied in the affirmative . He felt the delicacy of his situation , and modestly replied , ‘ No. ’ ‘ Are you , sir ? ’ inquired Mr. Snodgrass . ‘ I was once upon a time , ’ replied the host ; ‘ but I have given it up now . I subscribe to the club here , but I don ’ t play. ’ ‘ The grand match is played to-day , I believe , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ It is , ’ replied the host . ‘ Of course you would like to see it. ’ ‘ I , sir , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick , ‘ am delighted to view any sports which may be safely indulged in , and in which the impotent effects of unskilful people do not endanger human life. ’ Mr. Pickwick paused , and looked steadily on Mr. Winkle , who quailed beneath his leader ’ s searching glance . The great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes , and added : ‘ Shall we be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the care of the ladies ? ’ ‘ You can not leave me in better hands , ’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘ Quite impossible , ’ said Mr. Snodgrass . It was therefore settled that Mr. Tupman should be left at home in charge of the females ; and that the remainder of the guests , under the guidance of Mr. Wardle , should proceed to the spot where was to be held that trial of skill , which had roused all Muggleton from its torpor , and inoculated Dingley Dell with a fever of excitement . As their walk , which was not above two miles long , lay through shady lanes and sequestered footpaths , and as their conversation turned upon the delightful scenery by which they were on every side surrounded , Mr. Pickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition they had used , when he found himself in the main street of the town of Muggleton . Everybody whose genius has a topographical bent knows perfectly well that Muggleton is a corporate town , with a mayor , burgesses , and freemen ; and anybody who has consulted the addresses of the mayor to the freemen , or the freemen to the mayor , or both to the corporation , or all three to Parliament , will learn from thence what they ought to have known before , that Muggleton is an ancient and loyal borough , mingling a zealous advocacy of Christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial rights ; in demonstration whereof , the mayor , corporation , and other inhabitants , have presented at divers times , no fewer than one thousand four hundred and twenty petitions against the continuance of negro slavery abroad , and an equal number against any interference with the factory system at home ; sixty-eight in favour of the sale of livings in the Church , and eighty-six for abolishing Sunday trading in the street . Mr. Pickwick stood in the principal street of this illustrious town , and gazed with an air of curiosity , not unmixed with interest , on the objects around him . There was an open square for the market-place ; and in the centre of it , a large inn with a sign-post in front , displaying an object very common in art , but rarely met with in nature -- to wit , a blue lion , with three bow legs in the air , balancing himself on the extreme point of the centre claw of his fourth foot . There were , within sight , an auctioneer ’ s and fire-agency office , a corn-factor ’ s , a linen- draper ’ s , a saddler ’ s , a distiller ’ s , a grocer ’ s , and a shoe-shop -- the last-mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats , bonnets , wearing apparel , cotton umbrellas , and useful knowledge . There was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front , which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney ; and there was , moreover , another red brick house with Venetian blinds , and a large brass door-plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon . A few boys were making their way to the cricket-field ; and two or three shopkeepers who were standing at their doors looked as if they should like to be making their way to the same spot , as indeed to all appearance they might have done , without losing any great amount of custom thereby . Mr. Pickwick having paused to make these observations , to be noted down at a more convenient period , hastened to rejoin his friends , who had turned out of the main street , and were already within sight of the field of battle . The wickets were pitched , and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties . The game had not yet commenced . Two or three Dingley Dellers , and All-Muggletonians , were amusing themselves with a majestic air by throwing the ball carelessly from hand to hand ; and several other gentlemen dressed like them , in straw hats , flannel jackets , and white trousers -- a costume in which they looked very much like amateur stone-masons -- were sprinkled about the tents , towards one of which Mr. Wardle conducted the party . Several dozen of ‘ How-are-you ’ s ? ’ hailed the old gentleman ’ s arrival ; and a general raising of the straw hats , and bending forward of the flannel jackets , followed his introduction of his guests as gentlemen from London , who were extremely anxious to witness the proceedings of the day , with which , he had no doubt , they would be greatly delighted . ‘ You had better step into the marquee , I think , Sir , ’ said one very stout gentleman , whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of flannel , elevated on a couple of inflated pillow-cases . ‘ You ’ ll find it much pleasanter , Sir , ’ urged another stout gentleman , who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid . ‘ You ’ re very good , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ This way , ’ said the first speaker ; ‘ they notch in here -- it ’ s the best place in the whole field ; ’ and the cricketer , panting on before , preceded them to the tent . ‘ Capital game -- smart sport -- fine exercise -- very , ’ were the words which fell upon Mr. Pickwick ’ s ear as he entered the tent ; and the first object that met his eyes was his green-coated friend of the Rochester coach , holding forth , to the no small delight and edification of a select circle of the chosen of All-Muggleton . His dress was slightly improved , and he wore boots ; but there was no mistaking him . The stranger recognised his friends immediately ; and , darting forward and seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand , dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity , talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction . ‘ This way -- this way -- capital fun -- lots of beer -- hogsheads ; rounds of beef -- bullocks ; mustard -- cart-loads ; glorious day -- down with you -- make yourself at home -- glad to see you -- very. ’ Mr. Pickwick sat down as he was bid , and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass also complied with the directions of their mysterious friend . Mr. Wardle looked on in silent wonder . ‘ Mr . Wardle -- a friend of mine , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Friend of yours ! -- My dear sir , how are you ? -- Friend of my friend ’ s -- give me your hand , sir ’ -- and the stranger grasped Mr. Wardle ’ s hand with all the fervour of a close intimacy of many years , and then stepped back a pace or two as if to take a full survey of his face and figure , and then shook hands with him again , if possible , more warmly than before . ‘ Well ; and how came you here ? ’ said Mr. Pickwick , with a smile in which benevolence struggled with surprise . ‘ Come , ’ replied the stranger -- ‘ stopping at Crown -- Crown at Muggleton -- met a party -- flannel jackets -- white trousers -- anchovy sandwiches -- devilled kidney -- splendid fellows -- glorious. ’ Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger ’ s system of stenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that he had , somehow or other , contracted an acquaintance with the All- Muggletons , which he had converted , by a process peculiar to himself , into that extent of good-fellowship on which a general invitation may be easily founded . His curiosity was therefore satisfied , and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing . All-Muggleton had the first innings ; and the interest became intense when Mr. Dumkins and Mr. Podder , two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club , walked , bat in hand , to their respective wickets . Mr. Luffey , the highest ornament of Dingley Dell , was pitched to bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins , and Mr . Struggles was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered Podder . Several players were stationed , to ‘ look out , ’ in different parts of the field , and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee , and stooping very much as if he were ‘ making a back ’ for some beginner at leap-frog . All the regular players do this sort of thing ; -- indeed it is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in any other position . The umpires were stationed behind the wickets ; the scorers were prepared to notch the runs ; a breathless silence ensued . Mr. Luffey retired a few paces behind the wicket of the passive Podder , and applied the ball to his right eye for several seconds . Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of Luffey . ‘ Play ! ’ suddenly cried the bowler . The ball flew from his hand straight and swift towards the centre stump of the wicket . The wary Dumkins was on the alert : it fell upon the tip of the bat , and bounded far away over the heads of the scouts , who had just stooped low enough to let it fly over them . ‘ Run -- run -- another. -- Now , then throw her up -- up with her -- stop there -- another -- no -- yes -- no -- throw her up , throw her up ! ’ -- Such were the shouts which followed the stroke ; and at the conclusion of which All-Muggleton had scored two . Nor was Podder behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and Muggleton . He blocked the doubtful balls , missed the bad ones , took the good ones , and sent them flying to all parts of the field . The scouts were hot and tired ; the bowlers were changed and bowled till their arms ached ; but Dumkins and Podder remained unconquered . Did an elderly gentleman essay to stop the progress of the ball , it rolled between his legs or slipped between his fingers . Did a slim gentleman try to catch it , it struck him on the nose , and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled violence , while the slim gentleman ’ s eyes filled with water , and his form writhed with anguish . Was it thrown straight up to the wicket , Dumkins had reached it before the ball . In short , when Dumkins was caught out , and Podder stumped out , All- Muggleton had notched some fifty-four , while the score of the Dingley Dellers was as blank as their faces . The advantage was too great to be recovered . In vain did the eager Luffey , and the enthusiastic Struggles , do all that skill and experience could suggest , to regain the ground Dingley Dell had lost in the contest -- it was of no avail ; and in an early period of the winning game Dingley Dell gave in , and allowed the superior prowess of All-Muggleton . The stranger , meanwhile , had been eating , drinking , and talking , without cessation . At every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and approval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner , which could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party concerned ; while at every bad attempt at a catch , and every failure to stop the ball , he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the devoted individual in such denunciations as -- ‘ Ah , ah ! -- stupid ’ -- ‘ Now , butter-fingers ’ -- ‘ Muff ’ -- ‘ Humbug ’ -- and so forth -- ejaculations which seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around , as a most excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble game of cricket . ‘ Capital game -- well played -- some strokes admirable , ’ said the stranger , as both sides crowded into the tent , at the conclusion of the game . ‘ You have played it , sir ? ’ inquired Mr. Wardle , who had been much amused by his loquacity . ‘ Played it ! Think I have -- thousands of times -- not here -- West Indies -- exciting thing -- hot work -- very. ’ ‘ It must be rather a warm pursuit in such a climate , ’ observed Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Warm ! -- red hot -- scorching -- glowing . Played a match once -- single wicket- -friend the colonel -- Sir Thomas Blazo -- who should get the greatest number of runs. -- Won the toss -- first innings -- seven o ’ clock A.M. -- six natives to look out -- went in ; kept in -- heat intense -- natives all fainted -- taken away -- fresh half-dozen ordered -- fainted also -- Blazo bowling -- supported by two natives -- couldn ’ t bowl me out -- fainted too -- cleared away the colonel -- wouldn ’ t give in -- faithful attendant -- Quanko Samba -- last man left -- sun so hot , bat in blisters , ball scorched brown -- five hundred and seventy runs -- rather exhausted -- Quanko mustered up last remaining strength -- bowled me out -- had a bath , and went out to dinner. ’ ‘ And what became of what ’ s-his-name , Sir ? ’ inquired an old gentleman . ‘ Blazo ? ’ ‘ No -- the other gentleman. ’ Quanko Samba ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir. ’ ‘ Poor Quanko -- never recovered it -- bowled on , on my account -- bowled off , on his own -- died , sir. ’ Here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug , but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents , we can not distinctly affirm . We only know that he paused suddenly , drew a long and deep breath , and looked anxiously on , as two of the principal members of the Dingley Dell club approached Mr. Pickwick , and said -- ‘ We are about to partake of a plain dinner at the Blue Lion , Sir ; we hope you and your friends will join us. ’ Of course , ’ said Mr. Wardle , ‘ among our friends we include Mr. -- ; ’ and he looked towards the stranger . ‘ Jingle , ’ said that versatile gentleman , taking the hint at once . ‘ Jingle -- Alfred Jingle , Esq. , of No Hall , Nowhere. ’ ‘ I shall be very happy , I am sure , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ So shall I , ’ said Mr. Alfred Jingle , drawing one arm through Mr. Pickwick ’ s , and another through Mr. Wardle ’ s , as he whispered confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman : -- ‘ Devilish good dinner -- cold , but capital -- peeped into the room this morning -- fowls and pies , and all that sort of thing -- pleasant fellows these -- well behaved , too -- very. ’ There being no further preliminaries to arrange , the company straggled into the town in little knots of twos and threes ; and within a quarter of an hour were all seated in the great room of the Blue Lion Inn , Muggleton -- Mr. Dumkins acting as chairman , and Mr. Luffey officiating as vice . There was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks , and plates ; a great running about of three ponderous-headed waiters , and a rapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table ; to each and every of which item of confusion , the facetious Mr. Jingle lent the aid of half-a-dozen ordinary men at least . When everybody had eaten as much as possible , the cloth was removed , bottles , glasses , and dessert were placed on the table ; and the waiters withdrew to ‘ clear away , ’ or in other words , to appropriate to their own private use and emolument whatever remnants of the eatables and drinkables they could contrive to lay their hands on . Amidst the general hum of mirth and conversation that ensued , there was a little man with a puffy Say-nothing-to-me , -or-I ’ ll-contradict-you sort of countenance , who remained very quiet ; occasionally looking round him when the conversation slackened , as if he contemplated putting in something very weighty ; and now and then bursting into a short cough of inexpressible grandeur . At length , during a moment of comparative silence , the little man called out in a very loud , solemn voice , -- ‘ Mr . Luffey ! ’ Everybody was hushed into a profound stillness as the individual addressed , replied -- ‘ Sir ! ’ ‘ I wish to address a few words to you , Sir , if you will entreat the gentlemen to fill their glasses. ’ Mr. Jingle uttered a patronising ‘ Hear , hear , ’ which was responded to by the remainder of the company ; and the glasses having been filled , the vice-president assumed an air of wisdom in a state of profound attention ; and said -- ‘ Mr . Staple. ’ ‘ Sir , ’ said the little man , rising , ‘ I wish to address what I have to say to you and not to our worthy chairman , because our worthy chairman is in some measure -- I may say in a great degree -- the subject of what I have to say , or I may say to -- to -- ’ ‘ State , ’ suggested Mr. Jingle . ‘ Yes , to state , ’ said the little man , ‘ I thank my honourable friend , if he will allow me to call him so ( four hears and one certainly from Mr. Jingle ) , for the suggestion . Sir , I am a Deller -- a Dingley Deller ( cheers ) . I can not lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the population of Muggleton ; nor , Sir , I will frankly admit , do I covet that honour : and I will tell you why , Sir ( hear ) ; to Muggleton I will readily concede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay claim -- they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or recapitulation from me . But , sir , while we remember that Muggleton has given birth to a Dumkins and a Podder , let us never forget that Dingley Dell can boast a Luffey and a Struggles . ( Vociferous cheering . ) Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen . Sir , I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion . ( Cheers . ) Every gentleman who hears me , is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual , who -- to use an ordinary figure of speech -- “ hung out ” in a tub , to the emperor Alexander : -- “ if I were not Diogenes , ” said he , “ I would be Alexander. ” I can well imagine these gentlemen to say , “ If I were not Dumkins I would be Luffey ; if I were not Podder I would be Struggles. ” ( Enthusiasm . ) But , gentlemen of Muggleton , is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand pre- eminent ? Have you never heard of Dumkins and determination ? Have you never been taught to associate Podder with property ? ( Great applause . ) Have you never , when struggling for your rights , your liberties , and your privileges , been reduced , if only for an instant , to misgiving and despair ? And when you have been thus depressed , has not the name of Dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out ; and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had never expired ? ( Great cheering . ) Gentlemen , I beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of “ Dumkins and Podder. ” ’ Here the little man ceased , and here the company commenced a raising of voices , and thumping of tables , which lasted with little intermission during the remainder of the evening . Other toasts were drunk . Mr. Luffey and Mr . Struggles , Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Jingle , were , each in his turn , the subject of unqualified eulogium ; and each in due course returned thanks for the honour . Enthusiastic as we are in the noble cause to which we have devoted ourselves , we should have felt a sensation of pride which we can not express , and a consciousness of having done something to merit immortality of which we are now deprived , could we have laid the faintest outline on these addresses before our ardent readers . Mr. Snodgrass , as usual , took a great mass of notes , which would no doubt have afforded most useful and valuable information , had not the burning eloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that gentleman ’ s hand so extremely unsteady , as to render his writing nearly unintelligible , and his style wholly so . By dint of patient investigation , we have been enabled to trace some characters bearing a faint resemblance to the names of the speakers ; and we can only discern an entry of a song ( supposed to have been sung by Mr. Jingle ) , in which the words ‘ bowl ’ ‘ sparkling ’ ‘ ruby ’ ‘ bright ’ and ‘ wine ’ are frequently repeated at short intervals . We fancy , too , that we can discern at the very end of the notes , some indistinct reference to ‘ broiled bones ’ ; and then the words ‘ cold ’ ‘ without ’ occur : but as any hypothesis we could found upon them must necessarily rest upon mere conjecture , we are not disposed to indulge in any of the speculations to which they may give rise . We will therefore return to Mr. Tupman ; merely adding that within some few minutes before twelve o ’ clock that night , the convocation of worthies of Dingley Dell and Muggleton were heard to sing , with great feeling and emphasis , the beautiful and pathetic national air of ‘ We won ’ t go home till morning , We won ’ t go home till morning , We won ’ t go home till morning , Till daylight doth appear. ’ CHAPTER VIII . STRONGLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE POSITION , THAT THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE IS NOT A RAILWAY The quiet seclusion of Dingley Dell , the presence of so many of the gentler sex , and the solicitude and anxiety they evinced in his behalf , were all favourable to the growth and development of those softer feelings which nature had implanted deep in the bosom of Mr. Tracy Tupman , and which now appeared destined to centre in one lovely object . The young ladies were pretty , their manners winning , their dispositions unexceptionable ; but there was a dignity in the air , a touch-me-not- ishness in the walk , a majesty in the eye , of the spinster aunt , to which , at their time of life , they could lay no claim , which distinguished her from any female on whom Mr. Tupman had ever gazed . That there was something kindred in their nature , something congenial in their souls , something mysteriously sympathetic in their bosoms , was evident . Her name was the first that rose to Mr. Tupman ’ s lips as he lay wounded on the grass ; and her hysteric laughter was the first sound that fell upon his ear when he was supported to the house . But had her agitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility which would have been equally irrepressible in any case ; or had it been called forth by a more ardent and passionate feeling , which he , of all men living , could alone awaken ? These were the doubts which racked his brain as he lay extended on the sofa ; these were the doubts which he determined should be at once and for ever resolved . It was evening . Isabella and Emily had strolled out with Mr. Trundle ; the deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair ; the snoring of the fat boy , penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen ; the buxom servants were lounging at the side door , enjoying the pleasantness of the hour , and the delights of a flirtation , on first principles , with certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm ; and there sat the interesting pair , uncared for by all , caring for none , and dreaming only of themselves ; there they sat , in short , like a pair of carefully-folded kid gloves -- bound up in each other . ‘ I have forgotten my flowers , ’ said the spinster aunt . ‘ Water them now , ’ said Mr. Tupman , in accents of persuasion . ‘ You will take cold in the evening air , ’ urged the spinster aunt affectionately . ‘ No , no , ’ said Mr. Tupman , rising ; ‘ it will do me good . Let me accompany you. ’ The lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth was placed , and taking his right arm led him to the garden . There was a bower at the farther end , with honeysuckle , jessamine , and creeping plants -- one of those sweet retreats which humane men erect for the accommodation of spiders . The spinster aunt took up a large watering-pot which lay in one corner , and was about to leave the arbour . Mr. Tupman detained her , and drew her to a seat beside him . ‘ Miss Wardle ! ’ said he . The spinster aunt trembled , till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant ’ s rattle . ‘ Miss Wardle , ’ said Mr. Tupman , ‘ you are an angel. ’ ‘ Mr . Tupman ! ’ exclaimed Rachael , blushing as red as the watering-pot itself . ‘ Nay , ’ said the eloquent Pickwickian -- ‘ I know it but too well. ’ ‘ All women are angels , they say , ’ murmured the lady playfully . ‘ Then what can you be ; or to what , without presumption , can I compare you ? ’ replied Mr. Tupman . ‘ Where was the woman ever seen who resembled you ? Where else could I hope to find so rare a combination of excellence and beauty ? Where else could I seek to -- Oh ! ’ Here Mr. Tupman paused , and pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering-pot . The lady turned aside her head . ‘ Men are such deceivers , ’ she softly whispered . ‘ They are , they are , ’ ejaculated Mr. Tupman ; ‘ but not all men . There lives at least one being who can never change -- one being who would be content to devote his whole existence to your happiness -- who lives but in your eyes -- who breathes but in your smiles -- who bears the heavy burden of life itself only for you. ’ ‘ Could such an individual be found -- ’ said the lady . ‘ But he _can_ be found , ’ said the ardent Mr. Tupman , interposing . ‘ He _is_ found . He is here , Miss Wardle. ’ And ere the lady was aware of his intention , Mr. Tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet . ‘ Mr . Tupman , rise , ’ said Rachael . ‘ Never ! ’ was the valorous reply . ‘ Oh , Rachael ! ’ He seized her passive hand , and the watering-pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his lips. -- ‘ Oh , Rachael ! say you love me. ’ ‘ Mr . Tupman , ’ said the spinster aunt , with averted head , ‘ I can hardly speak the words ; but -- but -- you are not wholly indifferent to me. ’ Mr. Tupman no sooner heard this avowal , than he proceeded to do what his enthusiastic emotions prompted , and what , for aught we know ( for we are but little acquainted with such matters ) , people so circumstanced always do . He jumped up , and , throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster aunt , imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses , which after a due show of struggling and resistance , she received so passively , that there is no telling how many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed , if the lady had not given a very unaffected start , and exclaimed in an affrighted tone -- ‘ Mr . Tupman , we are observed ! -- we are discovered ! ’ Mr. Tupman looked round . There was the fat boy , perfectly motionless , with his large circular eyes staring into the arbour , but without the slightest expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist could have referred to astonishment , curiosity , or any other known passion that agitates the human breast . Mr. Tupman gazed on the fat boy , and the fat boy stared at him ; and the longer Mr. Tupman observed the utter vacancy of the fat boy ’ s countenance , the more convinced he became that he either did not know , or did not understand , anything that had been going forward . Under this impression , he said with great firmness -- ‘ What do you want here , Sir ? ’ ‘ Supper ’ s ready , sir , ’ was the prompt reply . ‘ Have you just come here , sir ? ’ inquired Mr. Tupman , with a piercing look . ‘ Just , ’ replied the fat boy . Mr. Tupman looked at him very hard again ; but there was not a wink in his eye , or a curve in his face . Mr. Tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt , and walked towards the house ; the fat boy followed behind . ‘ He knows nothing of what has happened , ’ he whispered . ‘ Nothing , ’ said the spinster aunt . There was a sound behind them , as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle . Mr. Tupman turned sharply round . No ; it could not have been the fat boy ; there was not a gleam of mirth , or anything but feeding in his whole visage . ‘ He must have been fast asleep , ’ whispered Mr. Tupman . ‘ I have not the least doubt of it , ’ replied the spinster aunt . They both laughed heartily . Mr. Tupman was wrong . The fat boy , for once , had not been fast asleep . He was awake -- wide awake -- to what had been going forward . The supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation . The old lady had gone to bed ; Isabella Wardle devoted herself exclusively to Mr. Trundle ; the spinster ’ s attentions were reserved for Mr. Tupman ; and Emily ’ s thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object -- possibly they were with the absent Snodgrass . Eleven -- twelve -- one o ’ clock had struck , and the gentlemen had not arrived . Consternation sat on every face . Could they have been waylaid and robbed ? Should they send men and lanterns in every direction by which they could be supposed likely to have travelled home ? or should they -- Hark ! there they were . What could have made them so late ? A strange voice , too ! To whom could it belong ? They rushed into the kitchen , whither the truants had repaired , and at once obtained rather more than a glimmering of the real state of the case . Mr. Pickwick , with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked completely over his left eye , was leaning against the dresser , shaking his head from side to side , and producing a constant succession of the blandest and most benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any discernible cause or pretence whatsoever ; old Mr. Wardle , with a highly- inflamed countenance , was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman muttering protestations of eternal friendship ; Mr. Winkle , supporting himself by the eight-day clock , was feebly invoking destruction upon the head of any member of the family who should suggest the propriety of his retiring for the night ; and Mr. Snodgrass had sunk into a chair , with an expression of the most abject and hopeless misery that the human mind can imagine , portrayed in every lineament of his expressive face . ‘ Is anything the matter ? ’ inquired the three ladies . ‘ Nothing the matter , ’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘ We -- we ’ re -- all right. -- I say , Wardle , we ’ re all right , ain ’ t we ? ’ ‘ I should think so , ’ replied the jolly host. -- ‘ My dears , here ’ s my friend Mr. Jingle -- Mr. Pickwick ’ s friend , Mr. Jingle , come ‘ pon -- little visit. ’ ‘ Is anything the matter with Mr. Snodgrass , Sir ? ’ inquired Emily , with great anxiety . ‘ Nothing the matter , ma ’ am , ’ replied the stranger . ‘ Cricket dinner -- glorious party -- capital songs -- old port -- claret -- good -- very good -- wine , ma ’ am -- wine. ’ ‘ It wasn ’ t the wine , ’ murmured Mr. Snodgrass , in a broken voice . ‘ It was the salmon. ’ ( Somehow or other , it never is the wine , in these cases . ) ‘ Hadn ’ t they better go to bed , ma ’ am ? ’ inquired Emma . ‘ Two of the boys will carry the gentlemen upstairs. ’ ‘ I won ’ t go to bed , ’ said Mr. Winkle firmly . ‘ No living boy shall carry me , ’ said Mr. Pickwick stoutly ; and he went on smiling as before . ‘ Hurrah ! ’ gasped Mr. Winkle faintly . ‘ Hurrah ! ’ echoed Mr. Pickwick , taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor , and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen . At this humorous feat he laughed outright . ‘ Let ’ s -- have -- ‘ nother -- bottle , ’ cried Mr. Winkle , commencing in a very loud key , and ending in a very faint one . His head dropped upon his breast ; and , muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed , and a sanguinary regret that he had not ‘ done for old Tupman ’ in the morning , he fell fast asleep ; in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy , to whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person , Mr. Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of Mr. Tupman and quietly disappeared , smiling more than ever ; and Mr. Wardle , after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution , consigned to Mr. Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs , and retired , with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified . ‘ What a shocking scene ! ’ said the spinster aunt . ‘ Dis-gusting ! ’ ejaculated both the young ladies . ‘ Dreadful -- dreadful ! ’ said Jingle , looking very grave : he was about a bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions . ‘ Horrid spectacle -- very ! ’ ‘ What a nice man ! ’ whispered the spinster aunt to Mr. Tupman . ‘ Good-looking , too ! ’ whispered Emily Wardle . ‘ Oh , decidedly , ’ observed the spinster aunt . Mr. Tupman thought of the widow at Rochester , and his mind was troubled . The succeeding half-hour ’ s conversation was not of a nature to calm his perturbed spirit . The new visitor was very talkative , and the number of his anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness . Mr. Tupman felt that as Jingle ’ s popularity increased , he ( Tupman ) retired further into the shade . His laughter was forced -- his merriment feigned ; and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets , he thought , with horrid delight , on the satisfaction it would afford him to have Jingle ’ s head at that moment between the feather bed and the mattress . The indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning , and , although his companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the previous night , exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity of the breakfast-table . So successful were his efforts , that even the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through the trumpet ; and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt , that ‘ He ’ ( meaning Jingle ) ‘ was an impudent young fellow : ’ a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided . It was the old lady ’ s habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the arbour in which Mr. Tupman had already signalised himself , in form and manner following : first , the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old lady ’ s bedroom door , a close black satin bonnet , a warm cotton shawl , and a thick stick with a capacious handle ; and the old lady , having put on the bonnet and shawl at her leisure , would lean one hand on the stick and the other on the fat boy ’ s shoulder , and walk leisurely to the arbour , where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space of half an hour ; at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct her to the house . The old lady was very precise and very particular ; and as this ceremony had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest deviation from the accustomed form , she was not a little surprised on this particular morning to see the fat boy , instead of leaving the arbour , walk a few paces out of it , look carefully round him in every direction , and return towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound mystery . The old lady was timorous -- most old ladies are -- and her first impression was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin . She would have cried for assistance , but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of the power of screaming ; she , therefore , watched his motions with feelings of intense horror which were in no degree diminished by his coming close up to her , and shouting in her ear in an agitated , and as it seemed to her , a threatening tone -- ‘ Missus ! ’ Now it so happened that Mr. Jingle was walking in the garden close to the arbour at that moment . He too heard the shouts of ‘ Missus , ’ and stopped to hear more . There were three reasons for his doing so . In the first place , he was idle and curious ; secondly , he was by no means scrupulous ; thirdly , and lastly , he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs . So there he stood , and there he listened . ‘ Missus ! ’ shouted the fat boy . ‘ Well , Joe , ’ said the trembling old lady . ‘ I ’ m sure I have been a good mistress to you , Joe . You have invariably been treated very kindly . You have never had too much to do ; and you have always had enough to eat. ’ This last was an appeal to the fat boy ’ s most sensitive feelings . He seemed touched , as he replied emphatically -- ‘ I knows I has. ’ ‘ Then what can you want to do now ? ’ said the old lady , gaining courage . ‘ I wants to make your flesh creep , ’ replied the boy . This sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one ’ s gratitude ; and as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which such a result was to be attained , all her former horrors returned . ‘ What do you think I see in this very arbour last night ? ’ inquired the boy . ‘ Bless us ! What ? ’ exclaimed the old lady , alarmed at the solemn manner of the corpulent youth . ‘ The strange gentleman -- him as had his arm hurt -- a-kissin ’ and huggin ’ -- ‘ ‘ Who , Joe ? None of the servants , I hope. ’ Worser than that , ’ roared the fat boy , in the old lady ’ s ear . ‘ Not one of my grandda ’ aters ? ’ ‘ Worser than that. ’ ‘ Worse than that , Joe ! ’ said the old lady , who had thought this the extreme limit of human atrocity . ‘ Who was it , Joe ? I insist upon knowing. ’ The fat boy looked cautiously round , and having concluded his survey , shouted in the old lady ’ s ear -- ‘ Miss Rachael. ’ ‘ What ! ’ said the old lady , in a shrill tone . ‘ Speak louder. ’ ‘ Miss Rachael , ’ roared the fat boy . ‘ My da ’ ater ! ’ The train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent , communicated a blanc-mange like motion to his fat cheeks . ‘ And she suffered him ! ’ exclaimed the old lady . A grin stole over the fat boy ’ s features as he said -- ‘ I see her a-kissin ’ of him agin. ’ If Mr. Jingle , from his place of concealment , could have beheld the expression which the old lady ’ s face assumed at this communication , the probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his close vicinity to the summer-house . He listened attentively . Fragments of angry sentences such as , ‘ Without my permission ! ’ -- ‘ At her time of life ’ -- ‘ Miserable old ‘ ooman like me ’ -- ‘ Might have waited till I was dead , ’ and so forth , reached his ears ; and then he heard the heels of the fat boy ’ s boots crunching the gravel , as he retired and left the old lady alone . It was a remarkable coincidence perhaps , but it was nevertheless a fact , that Mr. Jingle within five minutes of his arrival at Manor Farm on the preceding night , had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the spinster aunt , without delay . He had observation enough to see , that his off-hand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of his attack ; and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed that most desirable of all requisites , a small independence . The imperative necessity of ousting his rival by some means or other , flashed quickly upon him , and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings tending to that end and object , without a moment ’ s delay . Fielding tells us that man is fire , and woman tow , and the Prince of Darkness sets a light to ‘ em . Mr. Jingle knew that young men , to spinster aunts , are as lighted gas to gunpowder , and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion without loss of time . Full of reflections upon this important decision , he crept from his place of concealment , and , under cover of the shrubs before mentioned , approached the house . Fortune seemed determined to favour his design . Mr. Tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just as he obtained a view of it ; and the young ladies , he knew , had walked out alone , soon after breakfast . The coast was clear . The breakfast-parlour door was partially open . He peeped in . The spinster aunt was knitting . He coughed ; she looked up and smiled . Hesitation formed no part of Mr. Alfred Jingle ’ s character . He laid his finger on his lips mysteriously , walked in , and closed the door . ‘ Miss Wardle , ’ said Mr. Jingle , with affected earnestness , ‘ forgive intrusion -- short acquaintance -- no time for ceremony -- all discovered. ’ ‘ Sir ! ’ said the spinster aunt , rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of Mr. Jingle ’ s sanity . ‘ Hush ! ’ said Mr. Jingle , in a stage-whisper -- ‘ Large boy -- dumpling face -- round eyes -- rascal ! ’ Here he shook his head expressively , and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation . ‘ I presume you allude to Joseph , Sir ? ’ said the lady , making an effort to appear composed . ‘ Yes , ma ’ am -- damn that Joe ! -- treacherous dog , Joe -- told the old lady -- old lady furious -- wild -- raving -- arbour -- Tupman -- kissing and hugging -- all that sort of thing -- eh , ma ’ am -- eh ? ’ ‘ Mr . Jingle , ’ said the spinster aunt , ‘ if you come here , Sir , to insult me -- ’ ‘ Not at all -- by no means , ’ replied the unabashed Mr. Jingle -- ‘ overheard the tale -- came to warn you of your danger -- tender my services -- prevent the hubbub . Never mind -- think it an insult -- leave the room ’ -- and he turned , as if to carry the threat into execution . ‘ What _shall_ I do ! ’ said the poor spinster , bursting into tears . ‘ My brother will be furious. ’ ‘ Of course he will , ’ said Mr. Jingle pausing -- ‘ outrageous. ’ Oh , Mr. Jingle , what _can_ I say ! ’ exclaimed the spinster aunt , in another flood of despair . ‘ Say he dreamt it , ’ replied Mr. Jingle coolly . A ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this suggestion . Mr. Jingle perceived it , and followed up his advantage . ‘ Pooh , pooh ! -- nothing more easy -- blackguard boy -- lovely woman -- fat boy horsewhipped -- you believed -- end of the matter -- all comfortable. ’ Whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill- timed discovery was delightful to the spinster ’ s feelings , or whether the hearing herself described as a ‘ lovely woman ’ softened the asperity of her grief , we know not . She blushed slightly , and cast a grateful look on Mr. Jingle . That insinuating gentleman sighed deeply , fixed his eyes on the spinster aunt ’ s face for a couple of minutes , started melodramatically , and suddenly withdrew them . ‘ You seem unhappy , Mr. Jingle , ’ said the lady , in a plaintive voice . ‘ May I show my gratitude for your kind interference , by inquiring into the cause , with a view , if possible , to its removal ? ’ ‘ Ha ! ’ exclaimed Mr. Jingle , with another start -- ‘ removal ! remove my unhappiness , and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the blessing -- who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the niece of the creature who -- but no ; he is my friend ; I will not expose his vices . Miss Wardle -- farewell ! ’ At the conclusion of this address , the most consecutive he was ever known to utter , Mr. Jingle applied to his eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed , and turned towards the door . ‘ Stay , Mr. Jingle ! ’ said the spinster aunt emphatically . ‘ You have made an allusion to Mr. Tupman -- explain it. ’ ‘ Never ! ’ exclaimed Jingle , with a professional ( i.e. , theatrical ) air . ‘ Never ! ’ and , by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further , he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down . ‘ Mr . Jingle , ’ said the aunt , ‘ I entreat -- I implore you , if there is any dreadful mystery connected with Mr. Tupman , reveal it. ’ ‘ Can I , ’ said Mr. Jingle , fixing his eyes on the aunt ’ s face -- ‘ can I see -- lovely creature -- sacrificed at the shrine -- heartless avarice ! ’ He appeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions for a few seconds , and then said in a low voice -- ‘ Tupman only wants your money. ’ ‘ The wretch ! ’ exclaimed the spinster , with energetic indignation . ( Mr. Jingle ’ s doubts were resolved . She _had_ money . ) ‘ More than that , ’ said Jingle -- ‘ loves another. ’ ‘ Another ! ’ ejaculated the spinster . ‘ Who ? ’ Short girl -- black eyes -- niece Emily. ’ There was a pause . Now , if there was one individual in the whole world , of whom the spinster aunt entertained a mortal and deep-rooted jealousy , it was this identical niece . The colour rushed over her face and neck , and she tossed her head in silence with an air of ineffable contempt . At last , biting her thin lips , and bridling up , she said -- ‘ It can ’ t be . I won ’ t believe it. ’ ‘ Watch ‘ em , ’ said Jingle . ‘ I will , ’ said the aunt . ‘ Watch his looks. ’ ‘ I will. ’ ‘ His whispers. ’ ‘ I will. ’ ‘ He ’ ll sit next her at table. ’ ‘ Let him. ’ ‘ He ’ ll flatter her. ’ ‘ Let him. ’ ‘ He ’ ll pay her every possible attention. ’ ‘ Let him. ’ ‘ And he ’ ll cut you. ’ ‘ Cut _me_ ! ’ screamed the spinster aunt . ‘ _he_ cut _me_ ; will he ! ’ and she trembled with rage and disappointment . ‘ You will convince yourself ? ’ said Jingle . ‘ I will. ’ ‘ You ’ ll show your spirit ? ’ ‘ I will. ’ You ’ ll not have him afterwards ? ’ ‘ Never. ’ ‘ You ’ ll take somebody else ? ’ Yes. ’ ‘ You shall. ’ Mr. Jingle fell on his knees , remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter ; and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt -- conditionally upon Mr. Tupman ’ s perjury being made clear and manifest . The burden of proof lay with Mr. Alfred Jingle ; and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner . The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes . Mr. Tracy Tupman was established at Emily ’ s side , ogling , whispering , and smiling , in opposition to Mr. Snodgrass . Not a word , not a look , not a glance , did he bestow upon his heart ’ s pride of the evening before . ‘ Damn that boy ! ’ thought old Mr. Wardle to himself. -- He had heard the story from his mother . ‘ Damn that boy ! He must have been asleep . It ’ s all imagination. ’ ‘ Traitor ! ’ thought the spinster aunt . ‘ Dear Mr. Jingle was not deceiving me . Ugh ! how I hate the wretch ! ’ The following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of Mr. Tracy Tupman . The time was evening ; the scene the garden . There were two figures walking in a side path ; one was rather short and stout ; the other tall and slim . They were Mr. Tupman and Mr. Jingle . The stout figure commenced the dialogue . ‘ How did I do it ? ’ he inquired . ‘ Splendid -- capital -- couldn ’ t act better myself -- you must repeat the part to-morrow -- every evening till further notice. ’ ‘ Does Rachael still wish it ? ’ ‘ Of course -- she don ’ t like it -- but must be done -- avert suspicion -- afraid of her brother -- says there ’ s no help for it -- only a few days more -- when old folks blinded -- crown your happiness. ’ ‘ Any message ? ’ ‘ Love -- best love -- kindest regards -- unalterable affection . Can I say anything for you ? ’ ‘ My dear fellow , ’ replied the unsuspicious Mr. Tupman , fervently grasping his ‘ friend ’ s ’ hand -- ‘ carry my best love -- say how hard I find it to dissemble -- say anything that ’ s kind : but add how sensible I am of the necessity of the suggestion she made to me , through you , this morning . Say I applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion. ’ I will . Anything more ? ’ ‘ Nothing , only add how ardently I long for the time when I may call her mine , and all dissimulation may be unnecessary. ’ ‘ Certainly , certainly . Anything more ? ’ ‘ Oh , my friend ! ’ said poor Mr. Tupman , again grasping the hand of his companion , ‘ receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness ; and forgive me if I have ever , even in thought , done you the injustice of supposing that you could stand in my way . My dear friend , can I ever repay you ? ’ ‘ Don ’ t talk of it , ’ replied Mr. Jingle . He stopped short , as if suddenly recollecting something , and said -- ‘ By the bye -- can ’ t spare ten pounds , can you ? -- very particular purpose -- pay you in three days. ’ ‘ I dare say I can , ’ replied Mr. Tupman , in the fulness of his heart . ‘ Three days , you say ? ’ ‘ Only three days -- all over then -- no more difficulties. ’ Mr. Tupman counted the money into his companion ’ s hand , and he dropped it piece by piece into his pocket , as they walked towards the house . ‘ Be careful , ’ said Mr. Jingle -- ‘ not a look. ’ ‘ Not a wink , ’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘ Not a syllable. ’ ‘ Not a whisper. ’ ‘ All your attentions to the niece -- rather rude , than otherwise , to the aunt -- only way of deceiving the old ones. ’ ‘ I ’ ll take care , ’ said Mr. Tupman aloud . ‘ And _I ’ ll_ take care , ’ said Mr. Jingle internally ; and they entered the house . The scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening , and on the three afternoons and evenings next ensuing . On the fourth , the host was in high spirits , for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the charge against Mr. Tupman . So was Mr. Tupman , for Mr. Jingle had told him that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis . So was Mr. Pickwick , for he was seldom otherwise . So was not Mr. Snodgrass , for he had grown jealous of Mr. Tupman . So was the old lady , for she had been winning at whist . So were Mr. Jingle and Miss Wardle , for reasons of sufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter . CHAPTER IX . A DISCOVERY AND A CHASE The supper was ready laid , the chairs were drawn round the table , bottles , jugs , and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard , and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole four-and-twenty hours . ‘ Where ’ s Rachael ? ’ said Mr. Wardle . ‘ Ay , and Jingle ? ’ added Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Dear me , ’ said the host , ‘ I wonder I haven ’ t missed him before . Why , I don ’ t think I ’ ve heard his voice for two hours at least . Emily , my dear , ring the bell. ’ The bell was rung , and the fat boy appeared . ‘ Where ’ s Miss Rachael ? ’ He couldn ’ t say . ‘ Where ’ s Mr. Jingle , then ? ’ He didn ’ t know . Everybody looked surprised . It was late -- past eleven o ’ clock . Mr. Tupman laughed in his sleeve . They were loitering somewhere , talking about him . Ha , ha ! capital notion that -- funny . ‘ Never mind , ’ said Wardle , after a short pause . ‘ They ’ ll turn up presently , I dare say . I never wait supper for anybody. ’ ‘ Excellent rule , that , ’ said Mr. Pickwick -- ‘ admirable. ’ ‘ Pray , sit down , ’ said the host . ‘ Certainly ’ said Mr. Pickwick ; and down they sat . There was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table , and Mr. Pickwick was supplied with a plentiful portion of it . He had raised his fork to his lips , and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of a piece of beef , when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen . He paused , and laid down his fork . Mr. Wardle paused too , and insensibly released his hold of the carving-knife , which remained inserted in the beef . He looked at Mr. Pickwick . Mr. Pickwick looked at him . Heavy footsteps were heard in the passage ; the parlour door was suddenly burst open ; and the man who had cleaned Mr. Pickwick ’ s boots on his first arrival , rushed into the room , followed by the fat boy and all the domestics . ‘ What the devil ’ s the meaning of this ? ’ exclaimed the host . ‘ The kitchen chimney ain ’ t a-fire , is it , Emma ? ’ inquired the old lady . ‘ Lor , grandma ! No , ’ screamed both the young ladies . ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ roared the master of the house . The man gasped for breath , and faintly ejaculated -- ‘ They ha ’ gone , mas ’ r ! -- gone right clean off , Sir ! ’ ( At this juncture Mr. Tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork , and to turn very pale . ) ‘ Who ’ s gone ? ’ said Mr. Wardle fiercely . ‘ Mus ’ r Jingle and Miss Rachael , in a po ’ -chay , from Blue Lion , Muggleton . I was there ; but I couldn ’ t stop ‘ em ; so I run off to tell ‘ ee. ’ ‘ I paid his expenses ! ’ said Mr. Tupman , jumping up frantically . ‘ He ’ s got ten pounds of mine ! -- stop him ! -- he ’ s swindled me ! -- I won ’ t bear it ! - -I ’ ll have justice , Pickwick ! -- I won ’ t stand it ! ’ and with sundry incoherent exclamations of the like nature , the unhappy gentleman spun round and round the apartment , in a transport of frenzy . ‘ Lord preserve us ! ’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick , eyeing the extraordinary gestures of his friend with terrified surprise . ‘ He ’ s gone mad ! What shall we do ? ’ Do ! ’ said the stout old host , who regarded only the last words of the sentence . ‘ Put the horse in the gig ! I ’ ll get a chaise at the Lion , and follow ‘ em instantly . Where ? ’ -- he exclaimed , as the man ran out to execute the commission -- ‘ where ’ s that villain , Joe ? ’ ‘ Here I am ! but I hain ’ t a willin , ’ replied a voice . It was the fat boy ’ s . ‘ Let me get at him , Pickwick , ’ cried Wardle , as he rushed at the ill- starred youth . ‘ He was bribed by that scoundrel , Jingle , to put me on a wrong scent , by telling a cock-and-bull story of my sister and your friend Tupman ! ’ ( Here Mr. Tupman sank into a chair . ) ‘ Let me get at him ! ’ ‘ Don ’ t let him ! ’ screamed all the women , above whose exclamations the blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible . ‘ I won ’ t be held ! ’ cried the old man . ‘ Mr . Winkle , take your hands off . Mr. Pickwick , let me go , sir ! ’ It was a beautiful sight , in that moment of turmoil and confusion , to behold the placid and philosophical expression of Mr. Pickwick ’ s face , albeit somewhat flushed with exertion , as he stood with his arms firmly clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host , thus restraining the impetuosity of his passion , while the fat boy was scratched , and pulled , and pushed from the room by all the females congregated therein . He had no sooner released his hold , than the man entered to announce that the gig was ready . ‘ Don ’ t let him go alone ! ’ screamed the females . ‘ He ’ ll kill somebody ! ’ ‘ I ’ ll go with him , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ You ’ re a good fellow , Pickwick , ’ said the host , grasping his hand . ‘ Emma , give Mr. Pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck -- make haste . Look after your grandmother , girls ; she has fainted away . Now then , are you ready ? ’ Mr. Pickwick ’ s mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large shawl , his hat having been put on his head , and his greatcoat thrown over his arm , he replied in the affirmative . They jumped into the gig . ‘ Give her her head , Tom , ’ cried the host ; and away they went , down the narrow lanes ; jolting in and out of the cart- ruts , and bumping up against the hedges on either side , as if they would go to pieces every moment . ‘ How much are they ahead ? ’ shouted Wardle , as they drove up to the door of the Blue Lion , round which a little crowd had collected , late as it was . ‘ Not above three-quarters of an hour , ’ was everybody ’ s reply . ‘ Chaise-and-four directly ! -- out with ‘ em ! Put up the gig afterwards. ’ ‘ Now , boys ! ’ cried the landlord -- ‘ chaise-and-four out -- make haste -- look alive there ! ’ Away ran the hostlers and the boys . The lanterns glimmered , as the men ran to and fro ; the horses ’ hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard ; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house ; and all was noise and bustle . ‘ Now then ! -- is that chaise coming out to-night ? ’ cried Wardle . ‘ Coming down the yard now , Sir , ’ replied the hostler . Out came the chaise -- in went the horses -- on sprang the boys -- in got the travellers . ‘ Mind -- the seven-mile stage in less than half an hour ! ’ shouted Wardle . ‘ Off with you ! ’ The boys applied whip and spur , the waiters shouted , the hostlers cheered , and away they went , fast and furiously . ‘ Pretty situation , ’ thought Mr. Pickwick , when he had had a moment ’ s time for reflection . ‘ Pretty situation for the general chairman of the Pickwick Club . Damp chaise -- strange horses -- fifteen miles an hour -- and twelve o ’ clock at night ! ’ For the first three or four miles , not a word was spoken by either of the gentlemen , each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address any observations to his companion . When they had gone over that much ground , however , and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do their work in really good style , Mr. Pickwick became too much exhilarated with the rapidity of the motion , to remain any longer perfectly mute . ‘ We ’ re sure to catch them , I think , ’ said he . ‘ Hope so , ’ replied his companion . ‘ Fine night , ’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking up at the moon , which was shining brightly . ‘ So much the worse , ’ returned Wardle ; ‘ for they ’ ll have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us , and we shall lose it . It will have gone down in another hour. ’ ‘ It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark , won ’ t it ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘ I dare say it will , ’ replied his friend dryly . Mr. Pickwick ’ s temporary excitement began to sober down a little , as he reflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which he had so thoughtlessly embarked . He was roused by a loud shouting of the post-boy on the leader . ‘ Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe ! ’ went the first boy . ‘ Yo-yo-yo-yoe ! ’ went the second . ‘ Yo-yo-yo-yoe ! ’ chimed in old Wardle himself , most lustily , with his head and half his body out of the coach window . ‘ Yo-yo-yo-yoe ! ’ shouted Mr. Pickwick , taking up the burden of the cry , though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object . And amidst the yo-yoing of the whole four , the chaise stopped . ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘ There ’ s a gate here , ’ replied old Wardle . ‘ We shall hear something of the fugitives. ’ After a lapse of five minutes , consumed in incessant knocking and shouting , an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the turnpike-house , and opened the gate . ‘ How long is it since a post-chaise went through here ? ’ inquired Mr. Wardle . ‘ How long ? ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ ‘ Why , I don ’ t rightly know . It worn ’ t a long time ago , nor it worn ’ t a short time ago -- just between the two , perhaps. ’ ‘ Has any chaise been by at all ? ’ ‘ Oh , yes , there ’ s been a chay by. ’ ‘ How long ago , my friend , ’ interposed Mr. Pickwick ; ‘ an hour ? ’ ‘ Ah , I dare say it might be , ’ replied the man . ‘ Or two hours ? ’ inquired the post -- boy on the wheeler . ‘ Well , I shouldn ’ t wonder if it was , ’ returned the old man doubtfully . ‘ Drive on , boys , ’ cried the testy old gentleman ; ‘ don ’ t waste any more time with that old idiot ! ’ ‘ Idiot ! ’ exclaimed the old man with a grin , as he stood in the middle of the road with the gate half-closed , watching the chaise which rapidly diminished in the increasing distance . ‘ No -- not much o ’ that either ; you ’ ve lost ten minutes here , and gone away as wise as you came , arter all . If every man on the line as has a guinea give him , earns it half as well , you won ’ t catch t ’ other chay this side Mich ’ lmas , old short-and- fat. ’ And with another prolonged grin , the old man closed the gate , re- entered his house , and bolted the door after him . Meanwhile the chaise proceeded , without any slackening of pace , towards the conclusion of the stage . The moon , as Wardle had foretold , was rapidly on the wane ; large tiers of dark , heavy clouds , which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past , now formed one black mass overhead ; and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise , seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night . The wind , too , which was directly against them , swept in furious gusts down the narrow road , and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway . Mr. Pickwick drew his coat closer about him , coiled himself more snugly up into the corner of the chaise , and fell into a sound sleep , from which he was only awakened by the stopping of the vehicle , the sound of the hostler ’ s bell , and a loud cry of ‘ Horses on directly ! ’ But here another delay occurred . The boys were sleeping with such mysterious soundness , that it took five minutes a-piece to wake them . The hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable , and even when that was found , two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong horses , and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh . Had Mr. Pickwick been alone , these multiplied obstacles would have completely put an end to the pursuit at once , but old Wardle was not to be so easily daunted ; and he laid about him with such hearty good-will , cuffing this man , and pushing that ; strapping a buckle here , and taking in a link there , that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could reasonably have been expected , under so many difficulties . They resumed their journey ; and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging . The stage was fifteen miles long , the night was dark , the wind high , and the rain pouring in torrents . It was impossible to make any great way against such obstacles united ; it was hard upon one o ’ clock already ; and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end of the stage . Here , however , an object presented itself , which rekindled their hopes , and reanimated their drooping spirits . ‘ When did this chaise come in ? ’ cried old Wardle , leaping out of his own vehicle , and pointing to one covered with wet mud , which was standing in the yard . ‘ Not a quarter of an hour ago , sir , ’ replied the hostler , to whom the question was addressed . ‘ Lady and gentleman ? ’ inquired Wardle , almost breathless with impatience . ‘ Yes , sir. ’ ‘ Tall gentleman -- dress-coat -- long legs -- thin body ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir. ’ ‘ Elderly lady -- thin face -- rather skinny -- eh ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir. ’ ‘ By heavens , it ’ s the couple , Pickwick , ’ exclaimed the old gentleman . ‘ Would have been here before , ’ said the hostler , ‘ but they broke a trace. ’ ‘ ’ Tis them ! ’ said Wardle , ‘ it is , by Jove ! Chaise-and-four instantly ! We shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage . A guinea a-piece , boys-be alive there -- bustle about -- there ’ s good fellows. ’ And with such admonitions as these , the old gentleman ran up and down the yard , and bustled to and fro , in a state of excitement which communicated itself to Mr. Pickwick also ; and under the influence of which , that gentleman got himself into complicated entanglements with harness , and mixed up with horses and wheels of chaises , in the most surprising manner , firmly believing that by so doing he was materially forwarding the preparations for their resuming their journey . ‘ Jump in -- jump in ! ’ cried old Wardle , climbing into the chaise , pulling up the steps , and slamming the door after him . ‘ Come along ! Make haste ! ’ And before Mr. Pickwick knew precisely what he was about , he felt himself forced in at the other door , by one pull from the old gentleman and one push from the hostler ; and off they were again . ‘ Ah ! we are moving now , ’ said the old gentleman exultingly . They were indeed , as was sufficiently testified to Mr. Pickwick , by his constant collision either with the hard wood-work of the chaise , or the body of his companion . ‘ Hold up ! ’ said the stout old Mr. Wardle , as Mr. Pickwick dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat . ‘ I never did feel such a jolting in my life , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Never mind , ’ replied his companion , ‘ it will soon be over . Steady , steady. ’ Mr. Pickwick planted himself into his own corner , as firmly as he could ; and on whirled the chaise faster than ever . They had travelled in this way about three miles , when Mr. Wardle , who had been looking out of the Window for two or three minutes , suddenly drew in his face , covered with splashes , and exclaimed in breathless eagerness -- ‘ Here they are ! ’ Mr. Pickwick thrust his head out of his window . Yes : there was a chaise- and-four , a short distance before them , dashing along at full gallop . ‘ Go on , go on , ’ almost shrieked the old gentleman . ‘ Two guineas a-piece , boys -- don ’ t let ‘ em gain on us -- keep it up -- keep it up. ’ The horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed ; and those in Mr. Wardle ’ s galloped furiously behind them . ‘ I see his head , ’ exclaimed the choleric old man ; ‘ damme , I see his head. ’ ‘ So do I ’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘ that ’ s he. ’ Mr. Pickwick was not mistaken . The countenance of Mr. Jingle , completely coated with mud thrown up by the wheels , was plainly discernible at the window of his chaise ; and the motion of his arm , which was waving violently towards the postillions , denoted that he was encouraging them to increased exertion . The interest was intense . Fields , trees , and hedges , seemed to rush past them with the velocity of a whirlwind , so rapid was the pace at which they tore along . They were close by the side of the first chaise . Jingle ’ s voice could be plainly heard , even above the din of the wheels , urging on the boys . Old Mr. Wardle foamed with rage and excitement . He roared out scoundrels and villains by the dozen , clenched his fist and shook it expressively at the object of his indignation ; but Mr. Jingle only answered with a contemptuous smile , and replied to his menaces by a shout of triumph , as his horses , answering the increased application of whip and spur , broke into a faster gallop , and left the pursuers behind . Mr. Pickwick had just drawn in his head , and Mr. Wardle , exhausted with shouting , had done the same , when a tremendous jolt threw them forward against the front of the vehicle . There was a sudden bump -- a loud crash- -away rolled a wheel , and over went the chaise . After a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion , in which nothing but the plunging of horses , and breaking of glass could be made out , Mr. Pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the chaise ; and as soon as he had gained his feet , extricated his head from the skirts of his greatcoat , which materially impeded the usefulness of his spectacles , the full disaster of the case met his view . Old Mr. Wardle without a hat , and his clothes torn in several places , stood by his side , and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet . The post-boys , who had succeeded in cutting the traces , were standing , disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding , by the horses ’ heads . About a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise , which had pulled up on hearing the crash . The postillions , each with a broad grin convulsing his countenance , were viewing the adverse party from their saddles , and Mr. Jingle was contemplating the wreck from the coach window , with evident satisfaction . The day was just breaking , and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning . ‘ Hollo ! ’ shouted the shameless Jingle , ‘ anybody damaged ? -- elderly gentlemen -- no light weights -- dangerous work -- very. ’ ‘ You ’ re a rascal , ’ roared Wardle . ‘ Ha ! ha ! ’ replied Jingle ; and then he added , with a knowing wink , and a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise -- ‘ I say -- she ’ s very well -- desires her compliments -- begs you won ’ t trouble yourself -- love to _Tuppy_ -- won ’ t you get up behind ? -- drive on , boys. ’ The postillions resumed their proper attitudes , and away rattled the chaise , Mr. Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the coach window . Nothing in the whole adventure , not even the upset , had disturbed the calm and equable current of Mr. Pickwick ’ s temper . The villainy , however , which could first borrow money of his faithful follower , and then abbreviate his name to ‘ Tuppy , ’ was more than he could patiently bear . He drew his breath hard , and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles , as he said , slowly and emphatically -- ‘ If ever I meet that man again , I ’ ll -- ’ ‘ Yes , yes , ’ interrupted Wardle , ‘ that ’ s all very well ; but while we stand talking here , they ’ ll get their licence , and be married in London. ’ Mr. Pickwick paused , bottled up his vengeance , and corked it down . ‘ How far is it to the next stage ? ’ inquired Mr. Wardle , of one of the boys . ‘ Six mile , ain ’ t it , Tom ? ’ ‘ Rayther better. ’ ‘ Rayther better nor six mile , Sir. ’ ‘ Can ’ t be helped , ’ said Wardle , ‘ we must walk it , Pickwick. ’ ‘ No help for it , ’ replied that truly great man . So sending forward one of the boys on horseback , to procure a fresh chaise and horses , and leaving the other behind to take care of the broken one , Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Wardle set manfully forward on the walk , first tying their shawls round their necks , and slouching down their hats to escape as much as possible from the deluge of rain , which after a slight cessation had again begun to pour heavily down . CHAPTER X . CLEARING UP ALL DOUBTS ( IF ANY EXISTED ) OF THE DISINTERESTEDNESS OF MR. A. JINGLE ’ S CHARACTER There are in London several old inns , once the headquarters of celebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times ; but which have now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking- places of country wagons . The reader would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries , among the Golden Crosses and Bull and Mouths , which rear their stately fronts in the improved streets of London . If he would light upon any of these old places , he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town , and there in some secluded nooks he will find several , still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness , amidst the modern innovations which surround them . In the Borough especially , there still remain some half-dozen old inns , which have preserved their external features unchanged , and which have escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of private speculation . Great , rambling queer old places they are , with galleries , and passages , and staircases , wide enough and antiquated enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories , supposing we should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any , and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious legends connected with old London Bridge , and its adjacent neighbourhood on the Surrey side . It was in the yard of one of these inns -- of no less celebrated a one than the White Hart -- that a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt off a pair of boots , early on the morning succeeding the events narrated in the last chapter . He was habited in a coarse , striped waistcoat , with black calico sleeves , and blue glass buttons ; drab breeches and leggings . A bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose and unstudied style round his neck , and an old white hat was carelessly thrown on one side of his head . There were two rows of boots before him , one cleaned and the other dirty , and at every addition he made to the clean row , he paused from his work , and contemplated its results with evident satisfaction . The yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn . Three or four lumbering wagons , each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy , about the height of the second-floor window of an ordinary house , were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard ; and another , which was probably to commence its journey that morning , was drawn out into the open space . A double tier of bedroom galleries , with old clumsy balustrades , ran round two sides of the straggling area , and a double row of bells to correspond , sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof , hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee-room . Two or three gigs and chaise-carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent-houses ; and the occasional heavy tread of a cart-horse , or rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard , announced to anybody who cared about the matter , that the stable lay in that direction . When we add that a few boys in smock-frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages , wool-packs , and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw , we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the White Hart Inn , High Street , Borough , on the particular morning in question . A loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a smart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery , who , after tapping at one of the doors , and receiving a request from within , called over the balustrades -- ‘ Sam ! ’ ‘ Hollo , ’ replied the man with the white hat . ‘ Number twenty-two wants his boots. ’ ‘ Ask number twenty-two , vether he ’ ll have ‘ em now , or vait till he gets ‘ em , ’ was the reply . ‘ Come , don ’ t be a fool , Sam , ’ said the girl coaxingly , ‘ the gentleman wants his boots directly. ’ ‘ Well , you _are_ a nice young ‘ ooman for a musical party , you are , ’ said the boot-cleaner . ‘ Look at these here boots -- eleven pair o ’ boots ; and one shoe as belongs to number six , with the wooden leg . The eleven boots is to be called at half-past eight and the shoe at nine . Who ’ s number twenty-two , that ’ s to put all the others out ? No , no ; reg ’ lar rotation , as Jack Ketch said , ven he tied the men up . Sorry to keep you a-waitin ’ , Sir , but I ’ ll attend to you directly. ’ Saying which , the man in the white hat set to work upon a top-boot with increased assiduity . There was another loud ring ; and the bustling old landlady of the White Hart made her appearance in the opposite gallery . ‘ Sam , ’ cried the landlady , ‘ where ’ s that lazy , idle -- why , Sam -- oh , there you are ; why don ’ t you answer ? ’ ‘ Vouldn ’ t be gen-teel to answer , till you ’ d done talking , ’ replied Sam gruffly . ‘ Here , clean these shoes for number seventeen directly , and take ‘ em to private sitting-room , number five , first floor. ’ The landlady flung a pair of lady ’ s shoes into the yard , and bustled away . ‘ Number five , ’ said Sam , as he picked up the shoes , and taking a piece of chalk from his pocket , made a memorandum of their destination on the soles -- ‘ Lady ’ s shoes and private sittin ’ -room ! I suppose she didn ’ t come in the vagin. ’ ‘ She came in early this morning , ’ cried the girl , who was still leaning over the railing of the gallery , ‘ with a gentleman in a hackney-coach , and it ’ s him as wants his boots , and you ’ d better do ‘ em , that ’ s all about it. ’ ‘ Vy didn ’ t you say so before , ’ said Sam , with great indignation , singling out the boots in question from the heap before him . ‘ For all I know ’ d he was one o ’ the regular threepennies . Private room ! and a lady too ! If he ’ s anything of a gen ’ l ’ m ’ n , he ’ s vurth a shillin ’ a day , let alone the arrands. ’ Stimulated by this inspiring reflection , Mr. Samuel brushed away with such hearty good-will , that in a few minutes the boots and shoes , with a polish which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable Mr. Warren ( for they used Day & Martin at the White Hart ) , had arrived at the door of number five . ‘ Come in , ’ said a man ’ s voice , in reply to Sam ’ s rap at the door . Sam made his best bow , and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast . Having officiously deposited the gentleman ’ s boots right and left at his feet , and the lady ’ s shoes right and left at hers , he backed towards the door . ‘ Boots , ’ said the gentleman . ‘ Sir , ’ said Sam , closing the door , and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock . ‘ Do you know -- what ’ s a-name -- Doctors ’ Commons ? ’ ‘ Yes , Sir. ’ ‘ Where is it ? ’ ‘ Paul ’ s Churchyard , Sir ; low archway on the carriage side , bookseller ’ s at one corner , hotel on the other , and two porters in the middle as touts for licences. ’ ‘ Touts for licences ! ’ said the gentleman . ‘ Touts for licences , ’ replied Sam . ‘ Two coves in vhite aprons -- touches their hats ven you walk in -- “ Licence , Sir , licence ? ” Queer sort , them , and their mas ’ rs , too , sir -- Old Bailey Proctors -- and no mistake. ’ ‘ What do they do ? ’ inquired the gentleman . ‘ Do ! You , Sir ! That ain ’ t the worst on it , neither . They puts things into old gen ’ l ’ m ’ n ’ s heads as they never dreamed of . My father , Sir , wos a coachman . A widower he wos , and fat enough for anything -- uncommon fat , to be sure . His missus dies , and leaves him four hundred pound . Down he goes to the Commons , to see the lawyer and draw the blunt -- very smart -- top boots on -- nosegay in his button-hole -- broad-brimmed tile -- green shawl -- quite the gen ’ l ’ m ’ n . Goes through the archvay , thinking how he should inwest the money -- up comes the touter , touches his hat -- “ Licence , Sir , licence ? ” -- “ What ’ s that ? ” says my father. -- “ Licence , Sir , ” says he. -- “ What licence ? ” says my father. -- “ Marriage licence , ” says the touter. -- “ Dash my veskit , ” says my father , “ I never thought o ’ that. ” -- “ I think you wants one , Sir , ” says the touter . My father pulls up , and thinks a bit -- “ No , ” says he , “ damme , I ’ m too old , b ’ sides , I ’ m a many sizes too large , ” says he. -- “ Not a bit on it , Sir , ” says the touter. -- “ Think not ? ” says my father. -- “ I ’ m sure not , ” says he ; “ we married a gen ’ l ’ m ’ n twice your size , last Monday. ” -- “ Did you , though ? ” said my father. -- “ To be sure , we did , ” says the touter , “ you ’ re a babby to him -- this way , sir -- this way ! ” -- and sure enough my father walks arter him , like a tame monkey behind a horgan , into a little back office , vere a teller sat among dirty papers , and tin boxes , making believe he was busy . “ Pray take a seat , vile I makes out the affidavit , Sir , ” says the lawyer. -- “ Thank ’ ee , Sir , ” says my father , and down he sat , and stared with all his eyes , and his mouth vide open , at the names on the boxes . “ What ’ s your name , Sir , ” says the lawyer. -- “ Tony Weller , ” says my father. -- “ Parish ? ” says the lawyer . “ Belle Savage , ” says my father ; for he stopped there wen he drove up , and he know ’ d nothing about parishes , he didn ’ t. -- “ And what ’ s the lady ’ s name ? ” says the lawyer . My father was struck all of a heap . “ Blessed if I know , ” says he. -- “ Not know ! ” says the lawyer. -- “ No more nor you do , ” says my father ; “ can ’ t I put that in arterwards ? ” -- “ Impossible ! ” says the lawyer. -- “ Wery well , ” says my father , after he ’ d thought a moment , “ put down Mrs. Clarke. ” -- “ What Clarke ? ” says the lawyer , dipping his pen in the ink. -- “ Susan Clarke , Markis o ’ Granby , Dorking , ” says my father ; “ she ’ ll have me , if I ask . I des-say -- I never said nothing to her , but she ’ ll have me , I know. ” The licence was made out , and she _did_ have him , and what ’ s more she ’ s got him now ; and I never had any of the four hundred pound , worse luck . Beg your pardon , sir , ’ said Sam , when he had concluded , ‘ but wen I gets on this here grievance , I runs on like a new barrow with the wheel greased. ’ Having said which , and having paused for an instant to see whether he was wanted for anything more , Sam left the room . ‘ Half-past nine -- just the time -- off at once ; ’ said the gentleman , whom we need hardly introduce as Mr. Jingle . ‘ Time -- for what ? ’ said the spinster aunt coquettishly . ‘ Licence , dearest of angels -- give notice at the church -- call you mine , to-morrow ’ -- said Mr. Jingle , and he squeezed the spinster aunt ’ s hand . ‘ The licence ! ’ said Rachael , blushing . ‘ The licence , ’ repeated Mr. Jingle -- ‘ In hurry , post-haste for a licence , In hurry , ding dong I come back. ’ ‘ How you run on , ’ said Rachael . ‘ Run on -- nothing to the hours , days , weeks , months , years , when we ’ re united -- run on -- they ’ ll fly on -- bolt -- mizzle -- steam-engine -- thousand- horse power -- nothing to it. ’ ‘ Can ’ t -- can ’ t we be married before to-morrow morning ? ’ inquired Rachael . ‘ Impossible -- can ’ t be -- notice at the church -- leave the licence to-day -- ceremony come off to-morrow. ’ I am so terrified , lest my brother should discover us ! ’ said Rachael . ‘ Discover -- nonsense -- too much shaken by the break-down -- besides -- extreme caution -- gave up the post-chaise -- walked on -- took a hackney-coach -- came to the Borough -- last place in the world that he ’ d look in -- ha ! ha ! -- capital notion that -- very. ’ ‘ Don ’ t be long , ’ said the spinster affectionately , as Mr. Jingle stuck the pinched-up hat on his head . ‘ Long away from you ? -- Cruel charmer , ’ and Mr. Jingle skipped playfully up to the spinster aunt , imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips , and danced out of the room . ‘ Dear man ! ’ said the spinster , as the door closed after him . ‘ Rum old girl , ’ said Mr. Jingle , as he walked down the passage . It is painful to reflect upon the perfidy of our species ; and we will not , therefore , pursue the thread of Mr. Jingle ’ s meditations , as he wended his way to Doctors ’ Commons . It will be sufficient for our purpose to relate , that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons , who guard the entrance to that enchanted region , he reached the vicar-general ’ s office in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment , from the Archbishop of Canterbury , to his ‘ trusty and well-beloved Alfred Jingle and Rachael Wardle , greeting , ’ he carefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket , and retraced his steps in triumph to the Borough . He was yet on his way to the White Hart , when two plump gentleman and one thin one entered the yard , and looked round in search of some authorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries . Mr. Samuel Weller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of painted tops , the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing himself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a pot or two of porter , after the fatigues of the Borough market ; and to him the thin gentleman straightway advanced . ‘ My friend , ’ said the thin gentleman . ‘ You ’ re one o ’ the adwice gratis order , ’ thought Sam , ‘ or you wouldn ’ t be so THE PICKWICKIANS CHAPTER II .

In which the Pickwick Club is finally dissolved , and everything concluded to the Satisfaction of Everybody THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB CHAPTER I . THE PICKWICKIANS The first ray of light which illumines the gloom , and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved , is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick Club , which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers , as a proof of the careful attention , indefatigable assiduity , and nice discrimination , with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted . ‘ May 12 , 1827 . Joseph Smiggers , Esq. , P.V.P.M.P.C . [ Perpetual Vice- President -- Member Pickwick Club ] , presiding . The following resolutions unanimously agreed to : -- ‘ That this Association has heard read , with feelings of unmingled satisfaction , and unqualified approval , the paper communicated by Samuel Pickwick , Esq. , G.C.M.P.C . [ General Chairman -- Member Pickwick Club ] , entitled “ Speculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds , with some Observations on the Theory of Tittlebats ; ” and that this Association does hereby return its warmest thanks to the said Samuel Pickwick , Esq. , G.C.M.P.C. , for the same . ‘ That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which must accrue to the cause of science , from the production to which they have just adverted -- no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel Pickwick , Esq. , G.C.M.P.C. , in Hornsey , Highgate , Brixton , and Camberwell -- they can not but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of that learned man into a wider field , from extending his travels , and , consequently , enlarging his sphere of observation , to the advancement of knowledge , and the diffusion of learning . ‘ That , with the view just mentioned , this Association has taken into its serious consideration a proposal , emanating from the aforesaid , Samuel Pickwick , Esq. , G.C.M.P.C. , and three other Pickwickians hereinafter named , for forming a new branch of United Pickwickians , under the title of The Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club . ‘ That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this Association . ‘ That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club is therefore hereby constituted ; and that Samuel Pickwick , Esq. , G.C.M.P.C. , Tracy Tupman , Esq. , M.P.C. , Augustus Snodgrass , Esq. , M.P.C. , and Nathaniel Winkle , Esq. , M.P.C. , are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same ; and that they be requested to forward , from time to time , authenticated accounts of their journeys and investigations , of their observations of character and manners , and of the whole of their adventures , together with all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise , to the Pickwick Club , stationed in London . ‘ That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling expenses ; and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please , upon the same terms . ‘ That the members of the aforesaid Corresponding Society be , and are hereby informed , that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters , and the carriage of their parcels , has been deliberated upon by this Association : that this Association considers such proposal worthy of the great minds from which it emanated , and that it hereby signifies its perfect acquiescence therein. ’ A casual observer , adds the secretary , to whose notes we are indebted for the following account -- a casual observer might possibly have remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head , and circular spectacles , which were intently turned towards his ( the secretary ’ s ) face , during the reading of the above resolutions : to those who knew that the gigantic brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead , and that the beaming eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses , the sight was indeed an interesting one . There sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of Hampstead , and agitated the scientific world with his Theory of Tittlebats , as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day , or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar . And how much more interesting did the spectacle become , when , starting into full life and animation , as a simultaneous call for ‘ Pickwick ’ burst from his followers , that illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair , on which he had been previously seated , and addressed the club himself had founded . What a study for an artist did that exciting scene present ! The eloquent Pickwick , with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails , and the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation ; his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters , which , had they clothed an ordinary man , might have passed without observation , but which , when Pickwick clothed them -- if we may use the expression -- inspired involuntary awe and respect ; surrounded by the men who had volunteered to share the perils of his travels , and who were destined to participate in the glories of his discoveries . On his right sat Mr. Tracy Tupman -- the too susceptible Tupman , who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses -- love . Time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form ; the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed ; inch by inch had the gold watch-chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman ’ s vision ; and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat : but the soul of Tupman had known no change -- admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion . On the left of his great leader sat the poetic Snodgrass , and near him again the sporting Winkle ; the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue cloak with a canine-skin collar , and the latter communicating additional lustre to a new green shooting-coat , plaid neckerchief , and closely- fitted drabs . Mr. Pickwick ’ s oration upon this occasion , together with the debate thereon , is entered on the Transactions of the Club . Both bear a strong affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies ; and , as it is always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great men , we transfer the entry to these pages . ‘ Mr . Pickwick observed ( says the secretary ) that fame was dear to the heart of every man . Poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend Snodgrass ; the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend Tupman ; and the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field , the air , and the water was uppermost in the breast of his friend Winkle . He ( Mr. Pickwick ) would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and human feelings ( cheers ) -- possibly by human weaknesses ( loud cries of “ No ” ) ; but this he would say , that if ever the fire of self-importance broke out in his bosom , the desire to benefit the human race in preference effectually quenched it . The praise of mankind was his swing ; philanthropy was his insurance office . ( Vehement cheering . ) He had felt some pride -- he acknowledged it freely , and let his enemies make the most of it -- he had felt some pride when he presented his Tittlebatian Theory to the world ; it might be celebrated or it might not . ( A cry of “ It is , ” and great cheering . ) He would take the assertion of that honourable Pickwickian whose voice he had just heard -- it was celebrated ; but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the known world , the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him , on this , the proudest moment of his existence . ( Cheers . ) He was a humble individual . ( “ No , no. ” ) Still he could not but feel that they had selected him for a service of great honour , and of some danger . Travelling was in a troubled state , and the minds of coachmen were unsettled . Let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were enacting around them . Stage-coaches were upsetting in all directions , horses were bolting , boats were overturning , and boilers were bursting . ( Cheers -- a voice “ No. ” ) No ! ( Cheers . ) Let that honourable Pickwickian who cried “ No ” so loudly come forward and deny it , if he could . ( Cheers . ) Who was it that cried “ No ” ? ( Enthusiastic cheering . ) Was it some vain and disappointed man -- he would not say haberdasher ( loud cheers ) -- who , jealous of the praise which had been -- perhaps undeservedly -- bestowed on his ( Mr. Pickwick ’ s ) researches , and smarting under the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at rivalry , now took this vile and calumnious mode of -- ‘ MR . BLOTTON ( of Aldgate ) rose to order . Did the honourable Pickwickian allude to him ? ( Cries of “ Order , ” “ Chair , ” “ Yes , ” “ No , ” “ Go on , ” “ Leave off , ” etc . ) ‘ MR . PICKWICK would not put up to be put down by clamour . He had alluded to the honourable gentleman . ( Great excitement . ) ‘ MR . BLOTTON would only say then , that he repelled the hon . gent. ’ s false and scurrilous accusation , with profound contempt . ( Great cheering . ) The hon . gent . was a humbug . ( Immense confusion , and loud cries of “ Chair , ” and “ Order. ” ) ‘ Mr . A. SNODGRASS rose to order . He threw himself upon the chair . ( Hear . ) He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue . ( Hear , hear . ) ‘ The CHAIRMAN was quite sure the hon . Pickwickian would withdraw the expression he had just made use of . ‘ MR . BLOTTON , with all possible respect for the chair , was quite sure he would not . ‘ The CHAIRMAN felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable gentleman , whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him in a common sense . ‘ MR . BLOTTON had no hesitation in saying that he had not -- he had used the word in its Pickwickian sense . ( Hear , hear . ) He was bound to acknowledge that , personally , he entertained the highest regard and esteem for the honourable gentleman ; he had merely considered him a humbug in a Pickwickian point of view . ( Hear , hear . ) ‘ MR . PICKWICK felt much gratified by the fair , candid , and full explanation of his honourable friend . He begged it to be at once understood , that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a Pickwickian construction . ( Cheers . ) ’ Here the entry terminates , as we have no doubt the debate did also , after arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point . We have no official statement of the facts which the reader will find recorded in the next chapter , but they have been carefully collated from letters and other MS. authorities , so unquestionably genuine as to justify their narration in a connected form . CHAPTER II . THE FIRST DAY ’ S JOURNEY , AND THE FIRST EVENING ’ S ADVENTURES ; WITH THEIR CONSEQUENCES That punctual servant of all work , the sun , had just risen , and begun to strike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of May , one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven , when Mr. Samuel Pickwick burst like another sun from his slumbers , threw open his chamber window , and looked out upon the world beneath . Goswell Street was at his feet , Goswell Street was on his right hand -- as far as the eye could reach , Goswell Street extended on his left ; and the opposite side of Goswell Street was over the way . ‘ Such , ’ thought Mr. Pickwick , ‘ are the narrow views of those philosophers who , content with examining the things that lie before them , look not to the truths which are hidden beyond . As well might I be content to gaze on Goswell Street for ever , without one effort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround it. ’ And having given vent to this beautiful reflection , Mr. Pickwick proceeded to put himself into his clothes , and his clothes into his portmanteau . Great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire ; the operation of shaving , dressing , and coffee-imbibing was soon performed ; and , in another hour , Mr. Pickwick , with his portmanteau in his hand , his telescope in his greatcoat pocket , and his note-book in his waistcoat , ready for the reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down , had arrived at the coach-stand in St. Martin ’ s-le-Grand . ‘ Cab ! ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Here you are , sir , ’ shouted a strange specimen of the human race , in a sackcloth coat , and apron of the same , who , with a brass label and number round his neck , looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities . This was the waterman . ‘ Here you are , sir . Now , then , fust cab ! ’ And the first cab having been fetched from the public- house , where he had been smoking his first pipe , Mr. Pickwick and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle . ‘ Golden Cross , ’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘ Only a bob ’ s vorth , Tommy , ’ cried the driver sulkily , for the information of his friend the waterman , as the cab drove off . ‘ How old is that horse , my friend ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick , rubbing his nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare . ‘ Forty-two , ’ replied the driver , eyeing him askant . ‘ What ! ’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick , laying his hand upon his note-book . The driver reiterated his former statement . Mr. Pickwick looked very hard at the man ’ s face , but his features were immovable , so he noted down the fact forthwith . ‘ And how long do you keep him out at a time ? ’ inquired Mr. Pickwick , searching for further information . ‘ Two or three veeks , ’ replied the man . ‘ Weeks ! ’ said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment , and out came the note-book again . ‘ He lives at Pentonwil when he ’ s at home , ’ observed the driver coolly , ‘ but we seldom takes him home , on account of his weakness. ’ ‘ On account of his weakness ! ’ reiterated the perplexed Mr. Pickwick . ‘ He always falls down when he ’ s took out o ’ the cab , ’ continued the driver , ‘ but when he ’ s in it , we bears him up werry tight , and takes him in werry short ,",The Pickwick Papers
Bram Stoker,"boudoir , she wrote a note , taking so much trouble over it that she destroyed , and rewrote , till her dainty waste-basket was half- full of torn sheets of notepaper . When quite satisfied , she copied out the last sheet afresh , and then carefully burned all the spoiled fragments . She put the copied note in an emblazoned envelope , and directed it to Edgar Caswall at Castra Regis . This she sent off by one of her grooms . The letter ran : `` DEAR MR. CASWALL , `` I want to have a chat with you on a subject in which I believe you are interested . Will you kindly call for me one day after lunch -- say at three or four o'clock , and we can walk a little way together . Only as far as Mercy Farm , where I want to see Lilla and Mimi Watford . We can take a cup of tea at the Farm . Do not bring your African servant with you , as I am afraid his face frightens the girls . After all , he is not pretty , is he ? I have an idea you will be pleased with your visit this time . `` Yours sincerely , `` ARABELLA MARCH . '' At half-past three next day , Edgar Caswall called at Diana 's Grove . Lady Arabella met him on the roadway outside the gate . She wished to take the servants into her confidence as little as possible . She turned when she saw him coming , and walked beside him towards Mercy Farm , keeping step with him as they walked . When they got near Mercy , she turned and looked around her , expecting to see Oolanga or some sign of him . He was , however , not visible . He had received from his master peremptory orders to keep out of sight -- an order for which the African scored a new offence up against her . They found Lilla and Mimi at home and seemingly glad to see them , though both the girls were surprised at the visit coming so soon after the other . The proceedings were a repetition of the battle of souls of the former visit . On this occasion , however , Edgar Caswall had only the presence of Lady Arabella to support him -- Oolanga being absent ; but Mimi lacked the support of Adam Salton , which had been of such effective service before . This time the struggle for supremacy of will was longer and more determined . Caswall felt that if he could not achieve supremacy he had better give up the idea , so all his pride was enlisted against Mimi . When they had been waiting for the door to be opened , Lady Arabella , believing in a sudden attack , had said to him in a low voice , which somehow carried conviction : '' This time you should win . Mimi is , after all , only a woman . Show her no mercy . That is weakness . Fight her , beat her , trample on her -- kill her if need be . She stands in your way , and I hate her . Never take your eyes off her . Never mind Lilla -- she is afraid of you . You are already her master . Mimi will try to make you look at her cousin . There lies defeat . Let nothing take your attention from Mimi , and you will win . If she is overcoming you , take my hand and hold it hard whilst you are looking into her eyes . If she is too strong for you , I shall interfere . I 'll make a diversion , and under cover of it you must retire unbeaten , even if not victorious . Hush ! they are coming . '' The two girls came to the door together . Strange sounds were coming up over the Brow from the west . It was the rustling and crackling of the dry reeds and rushes from the low lands . The season had been an unusually dry one . Also the strong east wind was helping forward enormous flocks of birds , most of them pigeons with white cowls . Not only were their wings whirring , but their cooing was plainly audible . From such a multitude of birds the mass of sound , individually small , assumed the volume of a storm . Surprised at the influx of birds , to which they had been strangers so long , they all looked towards Castra Regis , from whose high tower the great kite had been flying as usual . But even as they looked , the cord broke , and the great kite fell headlong in a series of sweeping dives . Its own weight , and the aerial force opposed to it , which caused it to rise , combined with the strong easterly breeze , had been too much for the great length of cord holding it . Somehow , the mishap to the kite gave new hope to Mimi . It was as though the side issues had been shorn away , so that the main struggle was thenceforth on simpler lines . She had a feeling in her heart , as though some religious chord had been newly touched . It may , of course , have been that with the renewal of the bird voices a fresh courage , a fresh belief in the good issue of the struggle came too . In the misery of silence , from which they had all suffered for so long , any new train of thought was almost bound to be a boon . As the inrush of birds continued , their wings beating against the crackling rushes , Lady Arabella grew pale , and almost fainted . `` What is that ? '' she asked suddenly . To Mimi , born and bred in Siam , the sound was strangely like an exaggeration of the sound produced by a snake-charmer . Edgar Caswall was the first to recover from the interruption of the falling kite . After a few minutes he seemed to have quite recovered his _sang froid_ , and was able to use his brains to the end which he had in view . Mimi too quickly recovered herself , but from a different cause . With her it was a deep religious conviction that the struggle round her was of the powers of Good and Evil , and that Good was triumphing . The very appearance of the snowy birds , with the cowls of Saint Columba , heightened the impression . With this conviction strong upon her , she continued the strange battle with fresh vigour . She seemed to tower over Caswall , and he to give back before her oncoming . Once again her vigorous passes drove him to the door . He was just going out backward when Lady Arabella , who had been gazing at him with fixed eyes , caught his hand and tried to stop his movement . She was , however , unable to do any good , and so , holding hands , they passed out together . As they did so , the strange music which had so alarmed Lady Arabella suddenly stopped . Instinctively they all looked towards the tower of Castra Regis , and saw that the workmen had refixed the kite , which had risen again and was beginning to float out to its former station . As they were looking , the door opened and Michael Watford came into the room . By that time all had recovered their self-possession , and there was nothing out of the common to attract his attention . As he came in , seeing inquiring looks all around him , he said : '' The new influx of birds is only the annual migration of pigeons from Africa . I am told that it will soon be over . '' The second victory of Mimi Watford made Edgar Caswall more moody than ever . He felt thrown back on himself , and this , added to his absorbing interest in the hope of a victory of his mesmeric powers , became a deep and settled purpose of revenge . The chief object of his animosity was , of course , Mimi , whose will had overcome his , but it was obscured in greater or lesser degree by all who had opposed him . Lilla was next to Mimi in his hate -- Lilla , the harmless , tender-hearted , sweet-natured girl , whose heart was so full of love for all things that in it was no room for the passions of ordinary life -- whose nature resembled those doves of St. Columba , whose colour she wore , whose appearance she reflected . Adam Salton came next -- after a gap ; for against him Caswall had no direct animosity . He regarded him as an interference , a difficulty to be got rid of or destroyed . The young Australian had been so discreet that the most he had against him was his knowledge of what had been . Caswall did not understand him , and to such a nature as his , ignorance was a cause of alarm , of dread . Caswall resumed his habit of watching the great kite straining at its cord , varying his vigils in this way by a further examination of the mysterious treasures of his house , especially Mesmer 's chest . He sat much on the roof of the tower , brooding over his thwarted passion . The vast extent of his possessions , visible to him at that altitude , might , one would have thought , have restored some of his complacency . But the very extent of his ownership , thus perpetually brought before him , created a fresh sense of grievance . How was it , he thought , that with so much at command that others wished for , he could not achieve the dearest wishes of his heart ? In this state of intellectual and moral depravity , he found a solace in the renewal of his experiments with the mechanical powers of the kite . For a couple of weeks he did not see Lady Arabella , who was always on the watch for a chance of meeting him ; neither did he see the Watford girls , who studiously kept out of his way . Adam Salton simply marked time , keeping ready to deal with anything that might affect his friends . He called at the farm and heard from Mimi of the last battle of wills , but it had only one consequence . He got from Ross several more mongooses , including a second king-cobra-killer , which he generally carried with him in its box whenever he walked out . Mr. Caswall 's experiments with the kite went on successfully . Each day he tried the lifting of greater weight , and it seemed almost as if the machine had a sentience of its own , which was increasing with the obstacles placed before it . All this time the kite hung in the sky at an enormous height . The wind was steadily from the north , so the trend of the kite was to the south . All day long , runners of increasing magnitude were sent up . These were only of paper or thin cardboard , or leather , or other flexible materials . The great height at which the kite hung made a great concave curve in the string , so that as the runners went up they made a flapping sound . If one laid a finger on the string , the sound answered to the flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent murmur . Edgar Caswall , who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all belonging to it , found a distinct resemblance between that intermittent rumble and the snake-charming music produced by the pigeons flying through the dry reeds . One day he made a discovery in Mesmer 's chest which he thought he would utilise with regard to the runners . This was a great length of wire , '' fine as human hair , '' coiled round a finely made wheel , which ran to a wondrous distance freely , and as lightly . He tried this on runners , and found it work admirably . Whether the runner was alone , or carried something much more weighty than itself , it worked equally well . Also it was strong enough and light enough to draw back the runner without undue strain . He tried this a good many times successfully , but it was now growing dusk and he found some difficulty in keeping the runner in sight . So he looked for something heavy enough to keep it still . He placed the Egyptian image of Bes on the fine wire , which crossed the wooden ledge which protected it . Then , the darkness growing , he went indoors and forgot all about it . He had a strange feeling of uneasiness that night -- not sleeplessness , for he seemed conscious of being asleep . At daylight he rose , and as usual looked out for the kite . He did not see it in its usual position in the sky , so looked round the points of the compass . He was more than astonished when presently he saw the missing kite struggling as usual against the controlling cord . But it had gone to the further side of the tower , and now hung and strained _against the wind_ to the north . He thought it so strange that he determined to investigate the phenomenon , and to say nothing about it in the meantime . In his many travels , Edgar Caswall had been accustomed to use the sextant , and was now an expert in the matter . By the aid of this and other instruments , he was able to fix the position of the kite and the point over which it hung . He was startled to find that exactly under it -- so far as he could ascertain -- was Diana 's Grove . He had an inclination to take Lady Arabella into his confidence in the matter , but he thought better of it and wisely refrained . For some reason which he did not try to explain to himself , he was glad of his silence , when , on the following morning , he found , on looking out , that the point over which the kite then hovered was Mercy Farm . When he had verified this with his instruments , he sat before the window of the tower , looking out and thinking . The new locality was more to his liking than the other ; but the why of it puzzled him , all the same . He spent the rest of the day in the turret-room , which he did not leave all day . It seemed to him that he was now drawn by forces which he could not control -- of which , indeed , he had no knowledge -- in directions which he did not understand , and which were without his own volition . In sheer helpless inability to think the problem out satisfactorily , he called up a servant and told him to tell Oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turret-room . The answer came back that the African had not been seen since the previous evening . Caswall was now so irritable that even this small thing upset him . As he was distrait and wanted to talk to somebody , he sent for Simon Chester , who came at once , breathless with hurrying and upset by the unexpected summons . Caswall bade him sit down , and when the old man was in a less uneasy frame of mind , he again asked him if he had ever seen what was in Mesmer 's chest or heard it spoken about . Chester admitted that he had once , in the time of `` the then Mr. Edgar , '' seen the chest open , which , knowing something of its history and guessing more , so upset him that he had fainted . When he recovered , the chest was closed . From that time the then Mr. Edgar had never spoken about it again . When Caswall asked him to describe what he had seen when the chest was open , he got very agitated , and , despite all his efforts to remain calm , he suddenly went off into a faint . Caswall summoned servants , who applied the usual remedies . Still the old man did not recover . After the lapse of a considerable time , the doctor who had been summoned made his appearance . A glance was sufficient for him to make up his mind . Still , he knelt down by the old man , and made a careful examination . Then he rose to his feet , and in a hushed voice said : '' I grieve to say , sir , that he has passed away . '' CHAPTER XV -- ON THE TRACK Those who had seen Edgar Caswall familiarly since his arrival , and had already estimated his cold-blooded nature at something of its true value , were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old Chester . The fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at his character . They thought , naturally enough , that the concern which he felt was that of a master for a faithful old servant of his family . They little thought that it was merely the selfish expression of his disappointment , that he had thus lost the only remaining clue to an interesting piece of family history -- one which was now and would be for ever wrapped in mystery . Caswall knew enough about the life of his ancestor in Paris to wish to know more fully and more thoroughly all that had been . The period covered by that ancestor 's life in Paris was one inviting every form of curiosity . Lady Arabella , who had her own game to play , saw in the _metier_ of sympathetic friend , a series of meetings with the man she wanted to secure . She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old Chester 's death ; indeed , as soon as the news had filtered in through the back door of Diana 's Grove . At that meeting , she played her part so well that even Caswall 's cold nature was impressed . Oolanga was the only one who did not credit her with at least some sense of fine feeling in the matter . In emotional , as in other matters , Oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian , and as he could not understand anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering , pain , or for the loss of money , he could not understand anyone simulating such an emotion except for show intended to deceive . He thought that she had come to Castra Regis again for the opportunity of stealing something , and was determined that on this occasion the chance of pressing his advantage over her should not pass . He felt , therefore , that the occasion was one for extra carefulness in the watching of all that went on . Ever since he had come to the conclusion that Lady Arabella was trying to steal the treasure-chest , he suspected nearly everyone of the same design , and made it a point to watch all suspicious persons and places . As Adam was engaged on his own researches regarding Lady Arabella , it was only natural that there should be some crossing of each other 's tracks . This is what did actually happen . Adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he was interested , taking with him the mongoose in its box . He arrived at the gate of Diana 's Grove just as Lady Arabella was preparing to set out for Castra Regis on what she considered her mission of comfort . Seeing Adam from her window going through the shadows of the trees round the gate , she thought that he must be engaged on some purpose similar to her own . So , quickly making her toilet , she quietly left the house , and , taking advantage of every shadow and substance which could hide her , followed him on his walk . Oolanga , the experienced tracker , followed her , but succeeded in hiding his movements better than she did . He saw that Adam had on his shoulder a mysterious box , which he took to contain something valuable . Seeing that Lady Arabella was secretly following Adam , he was confirmed in this idea . His mind -- such as it was -- was fixed on her trying to steal , and he credited her at once with making use of this new opportunity . In his walk , Adam went into the grounds of Castra Regis , and Oolanga saw her follow him with great secrecy . He feared to go closer , as now on both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery . When he realised that Lady Arabella was bound for the Castle , he devoted himself to following her with singleness of purpose . He therefore missed seeing that Adam branched off the track and returned to the high road . That night Edgar Caswall had slept badly . The tragic occurrence of the day was on his mind , and he kept waking and thinking of it . After an early breakfast , he sat at the open window watching the kite and thinking of many things . From his room he could see all round the neighbourhood , but the two places that interested him most were Mercy Farm and Diana's Grove . At first the movements about those spots were of a humble kind -- those that belong to domestic service or agricultural needs -- the opening of doors and windows , the sweeping and brushing , and generally the restoration of habitual order . From his high window -- whose height made it a screen from the observation of others -- he saw the chain of watchers move into his own grounds , and then presently break up -- Adam Salton going one way , and Lady Arabella , followed by the nigger , another . Then Oolanga disappeared amongst the trees ; but Caswall could see that he was still watching . Lady Arabella , after looking around her , slipped in by the open door , and he could , of course , see her no longer . Presently , however , he heard a light tap at his door , then the door opened slowly , and he could see the flash of Lady Arabella 's white dress through the opening . CHAPTER XVI -- A VISIT OF SYMPATHY Caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw Lady Arabella , though he need not have been , after what had already occurred in the same way . The look of surprise on his face was so much greater than Lady Arabella had expected -- though she thought she was prepared to meet anything that might occur -- that she stood still , in sheer amazement . Cold-blooded as she was and ready for all social emergencies , she was nonplussed how to go on . She was plucky , however , and began to speak at once , although she had not the slightest idea what she was going to say . `` I came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have so lately experienced . '' `` My grief ? I 'm afraid I must be very dull ; but I really do not understand . '' Already she felt at a disadvantage , and hesitated . `` I mean about the old man who died so suddenly -- your old . . . retainer . '' Caswall 's face relaxed something of its puzzled concentration . `` Oh , he was only a servant ; and he had over-stayed his three-score and ten years by something like twenty years . He must have been ninety ! '' `` Still , as an old servant . . . `` Caswall 's words were not so cold as their inflection . `` I never interfere with servants . He was kept on here merely because he had been so long on the premises . I suppose the steward thought it might make him unpopular if the old fellow had been dismissed . '' How on earth was she to proceed on such a task as hers if this was the utmost geniality she could expect ? So she at once tried another tack -- this time a personal one . `` I am sorry I disturbed you . I am really not unconventional -- though certainly no slave to convention . Still there are limits . . . it is bad enough to intrude in this way , and I do not know what you can say or think of the time selected , for the intrusion . '' After all , Edgar Caswall was a gentleman by custom and habit , so he rose to the occasion . `` I can only say , Lady Arabella , that you are always welcome at any time you may deign to honour my house with your presence . '' She smiled at him sweetly . `` Thank you _so_ much . You _do_ put one at ease . My breach of convention makes me glad rather than sorry . I feel that I can open my heart to you about anything . '' Forthwith she proceeded to tell him about Oolanga and his strange suspicions of her honesty . Caswall laughed and made her explain all the details . His final comment was enlightening . `` Let me give you a word of advice : If you have the slightest fault to find with that infernal nigger , shoot him at sight . A swelled-headed nigger , with a bee in his bonnet , is one of the worst difficulties in the world to deal with . So better make a clean job of it , and wipe him out at once ! '' `` But what about the law , Mr . Caswall ? '' `` Oh , the law does n't concern itself much about dead niggers . A few more or less do not matter . To my mind it 's rather a relief ! '' `` I 'm afraid of you , '' was her only comment , made with a sweet smile and in a soft voice . `` All right , '' he said , `` let us leave it at that . Anyhow , we shall be rid of one of them ! '' `` I do n't love niggers any more than you do , '' she replied , `` and I suppose one must n't be too particular where that sort of cleaning up is concerned . '' Then she changed in voice and manner , and asked genially : '' And now tell me , am I forgiven ? '' `` You are , dear lady -- if there is anything to forgive . '' As he spoke , seeing that she had moved to go , he came to the door with her , and in the most natural way accompanied her downstairs . He passed through the hall with her and down the avenue . As he went back to the house , she smiled to herself . `` Well , that is all right . I do n't think the morning has been altogether thrown away . '' And she walked slowly back to Diana 's Grove . Adam Salton followed the line of the Brow , and refreshed his memory as to the various localities . He got home to Lesser Hill just as Sir Nathaniel was beginning lunch . Mr. Salton had gone to Walsall to keep an early appointment ; so he was all alone . When the meal was over -- seeing in Adam 's face that he had something to speak about -- he followed into the study and shut the door . When the two men had lighted their pipes , Sir Nathaniel began . `` I have remembered an interesting fact about Diana 's Grove -- there is , I have long understood , some strange mystery about that house . It may be of some interest , or it may be trivial , in such a tangled skein as we are trying to unravel . '' `` Please tell me all you know or suspect . To begin , then , of what sort is the mystery -- physical , mental , moral , historical , scientific , occult ? Any kind of hint will help me . '' `` Quite right . I shall try to tell you what I think ; but I have not put my thoughts on the subject in sequence , so you must forgive me if due order is not observed in my narration . I suppose you have seen the house at Diana 's Grove ? '' `` The outside of it ; but I have that in my mind 's eye , and I can fit into my memory whatever you may mention . '' `` The house is very old -- probably the first house of some sort that stood there was in the time of the Romans . This was probably renewed -- perhaps several times at later periods . The house stands , or , rather , used to stand here when Mercia was a kingdom -- I do not suppose that the basement can be later than the Norman Conquest . Some years ago , when I was President of the Mercian Archaeological Society , I went all over it very carefully . This was when it was purchased by Captain March . The house had then been done up , so as to be suitable for the bride . The basement is very strong , -- almost as strong and as heavy as if it had been intended as a fortress . There are a whole series of rooms deep underground . One of them in particular struck me . The room itself is of considerable size , but the masonry is more than massive . In the middle of the room is a sunk well , built up to floor level and evidently going deep underground . There is no windlass nor any trace of there ever having been any -- no rope -- nothing . Now , we know that the Romans had wells of immense depth , from which the water was lifted by the 'old rag rope ' ; that at Woodhull used to be nearly a thousand feet . Here , then , we have simply an enormously deep well-hole . The door of the room was massive , and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot square . It was evidently intended for some kind of protection to someone or something ; but no one in those days had ever heard of anyone having been allowed even to see the room . All this is _a propos_ of a suggestion on my part that the well-hole was a way by which the White Worm ( whatever it was ) went and came . At that time I would have had a search made -- even excavation if necessary -- at my own expense , but all suggestions were met with a prompt and explicit negative . So , of course , I took no further step in the matter . Then it died out of recollection -- even of mine . '' `` Do you remember , sir , '' asked Adam , `` what was the appearance of the room where the well-hole was ? Was there furniture -- in fact , any sort of thing in the room ? '' `` The only thing I remember was a sort of green light -- very clouded , very dim -- which came up from the well . Not a fixed light , but intermittent and irregular -- quite unlike anything I had ever seen . '' `` Do you remember how you got into the well-room ? Was there a separate door from outside , or was there any interior room or passage which opened into it ? '' `` I think there must have been some room with a way into it . I remember going up some steep steps ; they must have been worn smooth by long use or something of the kind , for I could hardly keep my feet as I went up . Once I stumbled and nearly fell into the well-hole . '' `` Was there anything strange about the place -- any queer smell , for instance ? '' `` Queer smell -- yes ! Like bilge or a rank swamp . It was distinctly nauseating ; when I came out I felt as if I had just been going to be sick . I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of what I saw or felt . '' `` Then perhaps , sir , later in the day you will tell me anything you may chance to recollect . '' `` I shall be delighted , Adam . If your uncle has not returned by then , I 'll join you in the study after dinner , and we can resume this interesting chat . '' CHAPTER XVII -- THE MYSTERY OF `` THE GROVE '' That afternoon Adam decided to do a little exploring . As he passed through the wood outside the gate of Diana 's Grove , he thought he saw the African 's face for an instant . So he went deeper into the undergrowth , and followed along parallel to the avenue to the house . He was glad that there was no workman or servant about , for he did not care that any of Lady Arabella 's people should find him wandering about her grounds . Taking advantage of the denseness of the trees , he came close to the house and skirted round it . He was repaid for his trouble , for on the far side of the house , close to where the rocky frontage of the cliff fell away , he saw Oolanga crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great oak . The man was so intent on watching someone , or something , that he did not guard against being himself watched . This suited Adam , for he could thus make scrutiny at will . The thick wood , though the trees were mostly of small girth , threw a heavy shadow , so that the steep declension , in front of which grew the tree behind which the African lurked , was almost in darkness . Adam drew as close as he could , and was amazed to see a patch of light on the ground before him ; when he realised what it was , he was determined , more than ever to follow on his quest . The nigger had a dark lantern in his hand , and was throwing the light down the steep incline . The glare showed a series of stone steps , which ended in a low-lying heavy iron door fixed against the side of the house . All the strange things he had heard from Sir Nathaniel , and all those , little and big , which he had himself noticed , crowded into his mind in a chaotic way . Instinctively he took refuge behind a thick oak stem , and set himself down , to watch what might occur . After a short time it became apparent that the African was trying to find out what was behind the heavy door . There was no way of looking in , for the door fitted tight into the massive stone slabs . The only opportunity for the entrance of light was through a small hole between the great stones above the door . This hole was too high up to look through from the ground level . Oolanga , having tried standing tiptoe on the highest point near , and holding the lantern as high as he could , threw the light round the edges of the door to see if he could find anywhere a hole or a flaw in the metal through which he could obtain a glimpse . Foiled in this , he brought from the shrubbery a plank , which he leant against the top of the door and then climbed up with great dexterity . This did not bring him near enough to the window-hole to look in , or even to throw the light of the lantern through it , so he climbed down and carried the plank back to the place from which he had got it . Then he concealed himself near the iron door and waited , manifestly with the intent of remaining there till someone came near . Presently Lady Arabella , moving noiselessly through the shade , approached the door . When he saw her close enough to touch it , Oolanga stepped forward from his concealment , and spoke in a whisper , which through the gloom sounded like a hiss . `` I want to see you , missy -- soon and secret . '' `` What do you want ? '' `` You know well , missy ; I told you already . '' She turned on him with blazing eyes , the green tint in them glowing like emeralds . `` Come , none of that . If there is anything sensible which you wish to say to me , you can see me here , just where we are , at seven o'clock . '' He made no reply in words , but , putting the backs of his hands together , bent lower and lower till his forehead touched the earth . Then he rose and went slowly away . Adam Salton , from his hiding-place , saw and wondered . In a few minutes he moved from his place and went home to Lesser Hill , fully determined that seven o'clock would find him in some hidden place behind Diana's Grove . At a little before seven Adam stole softly out of the house and took the back-way to the rear of Diana 's Grove . The place seemed silent and deserted , so he took the opportunity of concealing himself near the spot whence he had seen Oolanga trying to investigate whatever was concealed behind the iron door . He waited , perfectly still , and at last saw a gleam of white passing soundlessly through the undergrowth . He was not surprised when he recognised the colour of Lady Arabella 's dress . She came close and waited , with her face to the iron door . From some place of concealment near at hand Oolanga appeared , and came close to her . Adam noticed , with surprised amusement , that over his shoulder was the box with the mongoose . Of course the African did not know that he was seen by anyone , least of all by the man whose property he had with him . Silent-footed as he was , Lady Arabella heard him coming , and turned to meet him . It was somewhat hard to see in the gloom , for , as usual , he was all in black , only his collar and cuffs showing white . Lady Arabella opened the conversation which ensued between the two . `` What do you want ? To rob me , or murder me ? '' `` No , to lub you ! '' This frightened her a little , and she tried to change the tone . `` Is that a coffin you have with you ? If so , you are wasting your time . It would not hold me . '' When a nigger suspects he is being laughed at , all the ferocity of his nature comes to the front ; and this man was of the lowest kind . `` Dis ai n't no coffin for nobody . Dis box is for you . Somefin you lub . Me give him to you ! '' Still anxious to keep off the subject of affection , on which she believed him to have become crazed , she made another effort to keep his mind elsewhere . `` Is this why you want to see me ? '' He nodded . `` Then come round to the other door . But be quiet . I have no desire to be seen so close to my own house in conversation with a -- a -- a nigger like you ! '' She had chosen the word deliberately . She wished to meet his passion with another kind . Such would , at all events , help to keep him quiet . In the deep gloom she could not see the anger which suffused his face . Rolling eyeballs and grinding teeth are , however , sufficient signs of anger to be decipherable in the dark . She moved round the corner of the house to her right . Oolanga was following her , when she stopped him by raising her hand . `` No , not that door , '' she said ; `` that is not for niggers . The other door will do well enough for you ! '' Lady Arabella took in her hand a small key which hung at the end of her watch-chain , and moved to a small door , low down , round the corner , and a little downhill from the edge of the Brow . Oolanga , in obedience to her gesture , went back to the iron door . Adam looked carefully at the mongoose box as the African went by , and was glad to see that it was intact . Unconsciously , as he looked , he fingered the key that was in his waistcoat pocket . When Oolanga was out of sight , Adam hurried after Lady Arabella . CHAPTER XVIII -- EXIT OOLANGA The woman turned sharply as Adam touched her shoulder . `` One moment whilst we are alone . You had better not trust that nigger ! '' he whispered . Her answer was crisp and concise : '' I do n't . '' `` Forewarned is forearmed . Tell me if you will -- it is for your own protection . Why do you mistrust him ? '' `` My friend , you have no idea of that man 's impudence . Would you believe that he wants me to marry him ? '' `` No ! '' said Adam incredulously , amused in spite of himself . `` Yes , and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of treasure -- at least , he thought it was -- stolen from Mr. Caswall . Why do you distrust him , Mr . Salton ? '' `` Did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder ? That belongs to me . I left it in the gun-room when I went to lunch . He must have crept in and stolen it . Doubtless he thinks that it , too , is full of treasure . '' `` He does ! '' `` How on earth do you know ? '' asked Adam . `` A little while ago he offered to give it to me -- another bribe to accept him . Faugh ! I am ashamed to tell you such a thing . The beast ! '' Whilst they had been speaking , she had opened the door , a narrow iron one , well hung , for it opened easily and closed tightly without any creaking or sound of any kind . Within all was dark ; but she entered as freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it had been broad daylight . For Adam , there was just sufficient green light from somewhere for him to see that there was a broad flight of heavy stone steps leading upward ; but Lady Arabella , after shutting the door behind her , when it closed tightly without a clang , tripped up the steps lightly and swiftly . For an instant all was dark , but there came again the faint green light which enabled him to see the outlines of things . Another iron door , narrow like the first and fairly high , led into another large room , the walls of which were of massive stones , so closely joined together as to exhibit only one smooth surface . This presented the appearance of having at one time been polished . On the far side , also smooth like the walls , was the reverse of a wide , but not high , iron door . Here there was a little more light , for the high-up aperture over the door opened to the air . Lady Arabella took from her girdle another small key , which she inserted in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock . The great bolt seemed wonderfully hung , for the moment the small key was turned , the bolts of the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron doors swung open . On the stone steps outside stood Oolanga , with the mongoose box slung over his shoulder . Lady Arabella stood a little on one side , and the African , accepting the movement as an invitation , entered in an obsequious way . The moment , however , that he was inside , he gave a quick look around him . `` Much death here -- big death . Many deaths . Good , good ! '' He sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent . The matter and manner of his speech were so revolting that instinctively Adam 's hand wandered to his revolver , and , with his finger on the trigger , he rested satisfied that he was ready for any emergency . There was certainly opportunity for the nigger 's enjoyment , for the open well-hole was almost under his nose , sending up such a stench as almost made Adam sick , though Lady Arabella seemed not to mind it at all . It was like nothing that Adam had ever met with . He compared it with all the noxious experiences he had ever had -- the drainage of war hospitals , of slaughter-houses , the refuse of dissecting rooms . None of these was like it , though it had something of them all , with , added , the sourness of chemical waste and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water- logged ship whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned . Then , quite unexpectedly , the negro noticed the presence of a third person -- Adam Salton ! He pulled out a pistol and shot at him , happily missing . Adam was himself usually a quick shot , but this time his mind had been on something else and he was not ready . However , he was quick to carry out an intention , and he was not a coward . In another moment both men were in grips . Beside them was the dark well-hole , with that horrid effluvium stealing up from its mysterious depths . Adam and Oolanga both had pistols ; Lady Arabella , who had not one , was probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting , but that being impossible , she made her effort in another way . Gliding forward , she tried to seize the African ; but he eluded her grasp , just missing , in doing so , falling into the mysterious hole . As he swayed back to firm foothold , he turned his own gun on her and shot . Instinctively Adam leaped at his assailant ; clutching at each other , they tottered on the very brink . Lady Arabella 's anger , now fully awake , was all for Oolanga . She moved towards him with her hands extended , and had just seized him when the catch of the locked box -- due to some movement from within -- flew open , and the king-cobra-killer flew at her with a venomous fury impossible to describe . As it seized her throat , she caught hold of it , and , with a fury superior to its own , tore it in two just as if it had been a sheet of paper . The strength used for such an act must have been terrific . In an instant , it seemed to spout blood and entrails , and was hurled into the well-hole . In another instant she had seized Oolanga , and with a swift rush had drawn him , her white arms encircling him , down with her into the gaping aperture . Adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling circle , and as it sank down into the well , a pair of blazing green eyes became fixed , sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity , and disappeared , throwing upward the green light which grew more and more vivid every moment . As the light sank into the noisome depths , there came a shriek which chilled Adam 's blood -- a prolonged agony of pain and terror which seemed to have no end . Adam Salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from the memory of those dreadful moments . The gloom which surrounded that horrible charnel pit , which seemed to go down to the very bowels of the earth , conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of the nethermost hell . The ghastly fate of the African as he sank down to his terrible doom , his black face growing grey with terror , his white eyeballs , now like veined bloodstone , rolling in the helpless extremity of fear . The mysterious green light was in itself a milieu of horror . And through it all the awful cry came up from that fathomless pit , whose entrance was flooded with spots of fresh blood . Even the death of the fearless little snake-killer -- so fierce , so frightful , as if stained with a ferocity which told of no living force above earth , but only of the devils of the pit -- was only an incident . Adam was in a state of intellectual tumult , which had no parallel in his experience . He tried to rush away from the horrible place ; even the baleful green light , thrown up through the gloomy well-shaft , was dying away as its source sank deeper into the primeval ooze . The darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming density -- darkness in such a place and with such a memory of it ! He made a wild rush forward -- slipt on the steps in some sticky , acrid- smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood , and , falling forward , felt his way into the inner room , where the well-shaft was not . Then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement . Up the stone steps from the narrow door by which he had entered , glided the white-clad figure of Lady Arabella , the only colour to be seen on her being blood-marks on her face and hands and throat . Otherwise , she was calm and unruffled , as when earlier she stood aside for him to pass in through the narrow iron door . CHAPTER XIX -- AN ENEMY IN THE DARK Adam Salton went for a walk before returning to Lesser Hill ; he felt that it might be well , not only to steady his nerves , shaken by the horrible scene , but to get his thoughts into some sort of order , so as to be ready to enter on the matter with Sir Nathaniel . He was a little embarrassed as to telling his uncle , for affairs had so vastly progressed beyond his original view that he felt a little doubtful as to what would be the old gentleman 's attitude when he should hear of the strange events for the first time . Mr. Salton would certainly not be satisfied at being treated as an outsider with regard to such things , most of which had points of contact with the inmates of his own house . It was with an immense sense of relief that Adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the housekeeper that he was detained by business at Walsall , where he would remain for the night ; and that he would be back in the morning in time for lunch . When Adam got home after his walk , he found Sir Nathaniel just going to bed . He did not say anything to him then of what had happened , but contented himself with arranging that they would walk together in the early morning , as he had much to say that would require serious attention . Strangely enough he slept well , and awoke at dawn with his mind clear and his nerves in their usual unshaken condition . The maid brought up , with his early morning cup of tea , a note which had been found in the letter- box . It was from Lady Arabella , and was evidently intended to put him on his guard as to what he should say about the previous evening . He read it over carefully several times , before he was satisfied that he had taken in its full import . `` DEAR MR. SALTON , `` I can not go to bed until I have written to you , so you must forgive me if I disturb you , and at an unseemly time . Indeed , you must also forgive me if , in trying to do what is right , I err in saying too much or too little . The fact is that I am quite upset and unnerved by all that has happened in this terrible night . I find it difficult even to write ; my hands shake so that they are not under control , and I am trembling all over with memory of the horrors we saw enacted before our eyes . I am grieved beyond measure that I should be , however remotely , a cause of this horror coming on you . Forgive me if you can , and do not think too hardly of me . This I ask with confidence , for since we shared together the danger -- the very pangs -- of death , I feel that we should be to one another something more than mere friends , that I may lean on you and trust you , assured that your sympathy and pity are for me . You really must let me thank you for the friendliness , the help , the confidence , the real aid at a time of deadly danger and deadly fear which you showed me . That awful man -- I shall see him for ever in my dreams . His black , malignant face will shut out all memory of sunshine and happiness . I shall eternally see his evil eyes as he threw himself into that well-hole in a vain effort to escape from the consequences of his own misdoing . The more I think of it , the more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the whole thing -- of course , except his own horrible death . `` Perhaps you have noticed a fur collar I occasionally wear . It is one of my most valued treasures -- an ermine collar studded with emeralds . I had often seen the nigger 's eyes gleam covetously when he looked at it . Unhappily , I wore it yesterday . That may have been the cause that lured the poor man to his doom . On the very brink of the abyss he tore the collar from my neck -- that was the last I saw of him . When he sank into the hole , I was rushing to the iron door , which I pulled behind me . When I heard that soul-sickening yell , which marked his disappearance in the chasm , I was more glad than I can say that my eyes were spared the pain and horror which my ears had to endure . `` When I tore myself out of the negro 's grasp as he sank into the well- hole ; I realised what freedom meant . Freedom ! Freedom ! Not only from that noisome prison-house , which has now such a memory , but from the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster . Whilst I live , I shall always thank you for my freedom . A woman must sometimes express her gratitude ; otherwise it becomes too great to bear . I am not a sentimental girl , who merely likes to thank a man ; I am a woman who knows all , of bad as well as good , that life can give . I have known what it is to love and to lose . But you must not let me bring any unhappiness into your life . I must live on -- as I have lived -- alone , and , in addition , bear with other woes the memory of this latest insult and horror . In the meantime , I must get away as quickly as possible from Diana 's Grove . In the morning I shall go up to town , where I shall remain for a week -- I can not stay longer , as business affairs demand my presence here . I think , however , that a week in the rush of busy London , surrounded with multitudes of commonplace people , will help to soften -- I can not expect total obliteration -- the terrible images of the bygone night . When I can sleep easily -- which will be , I hope , after a day or two -- I shall be fit to return home and take up again the burden which will , I suppose , always be with me . `` I shall be most happy to see you on my return -- or earlier , if my good fortune sends you on any errand to London . I shall stay at the Mayfair Hotel . In that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers and horrors we have shared together . Adieu , and thank you , again and again , for all your kindness and consideration to me . `` ARABELLA MARSH . '' Adam was surprised by this effusive epistle , but he determined to say nothing of it to Sir Nathaniel until he should have thought it well over . When Adam met Sir Nathaniel at breakfast , he was glad that he had taken time to turn things over in his mind . The result had been that not only was he familiar with the facts in all their bearings , but he had already so far differentiated them that he was able to arrange them in his own mind according to their values . Breakfast had been a silent function , so it did not interfere in any way with the process of thought . So soon as the door was closed , Sir Nathaniel began : '' I see , Adam , that something has occurred , and that you have much to tell me . '' `` That is so , sir . I suppose I had better begin by telling you all I know -- all that has happened since I left you yesterday ? '' Accordingly Adam gave him details of all that had happened during the previous evening . He confined himself rigidly to the narration of circumstances , taking care not to colour events by any comment of his own , or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not fully understand . At first , Sir Nathaniel seemed disposed to ask questions , but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the narration was concise and self-explanatory . Thenceforth , he contented himself with quick looks and glances , easily interpreted , or by some acquiescent motions of his hands , when such could be convenient , to emphasise his idea of the correctness of any inference . Until Adam ceased speaking , having evidently come to an end of what he had to say with regard to this section of his story , the elder man made no comment whatever . Even when Adam took from his pocket Lady Arabella 's letter , with the manifest intention of reading it , he did not make any comment . Finally , when Adam folded up the letter and put it , in its envelope , back in his pocket , as an intimation that he had now quite finished , the old diplomatist carefully made a few notes in his pocket-book . `` Your narrative , my dear Adam , is altogether admirable . I think I may now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts , and that our conference had better take the shape of a mutual exchange of ideas . Let us both ask questions as they may arise ; and I do not doubt that we shall arrive at some enlightening conclusions . '' `` Will you kindly begin , sir ? I do not doubt that , with your longer experience , you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which envelops certain of the things which we have to consider . '' `` I hope so , my dear boy . For a beginning , then , let me say that Lady Arabella 's letter makes clear some things which she intended -- and also some things which she did not intend . But , before I begin to draw deductions , let me ask you a few questions . Adam , are you heart-whole , quite heart-whole , in the matter of Lady Arabella ? '' His companion answered at once , each looking the other straight in the eyes during question and answer . `` Lady Arabella , sir , is a charming woman , and I should have deemed it a privilege to meet her -- to talk to her -- even -- since I am in the confessional -- to flirt a little with her . But if you mean to ask if my affections are in any way engaged , I can emphatically answer 'No ! ' -- as indeed you will understand when presently I give you the reason . Apart from that , there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day . '' `` Could you -- would you mind giving me the reason now ? It will help us to understand what is before us , in the way of difficulty . '' `` Certainly , sir . My reason , on which I can fully depend , is that I love another woman ! '' `` That clinches it . May I offer my good wishes , and , I hope , my congratulations ? '' `` I am proud of your good wishes , sir , and I thank you for them . But it is too soon for congratulations -- the lady does not even know my hopes yet . Indeed , I hardly knew them myself , as definite , till this moment . '' `` I take it then , Adam , that at the right time I may be allowed to know who the lady is ? '' Adam laughed a low , sweet laugh , such as ripples from a happy heart . `` There need not be an hour 's , a minute 's delay . I shall be glad to share my secret with you , sir . The lady , sir , whom I am so happy as to love , and in whom my dreams of life-long happiness are centred , is Mimi Watford ! '' `` Then , my dear Adam , I need not wait to offer congratulations . She is indeed a very charming young lady . I do not think I ever saw a girl who united in such perfection the qualities of strength of character and sweetness of disposition . With all my heart , I congratulate you . Then I may take it that my question as to your heart-wholeness is answered in the affirmative ? '' `` Yes ; and now , sir , may I ask in turn why the question ? '' `` Certainly ! I asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a point where my questions might be painful to you . '' `` It is not merely that I love Mimi , but I have reason to look on Lady Arabella as her enemy , '' Adam continued . `` Her enemy ? '' `` Yes . A rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her destruction . '' Sir Nathaniel went to the door , looked outside it and returned , locking it carefully behind him . CHAPTER XX -- METABOLISM '' Am I looking grave ? '' asked Sir Nathaniel inconsequently when he re-entered the room . `` You certainly are , sir . '' `` We little thought when first we met that we should be drawn into such a vortex . Already we are mixed up in robbery , and probably murder , but -- a thousand times worse than all the crimes in the calendar -- in an affair of ghastly mystery which has no bottom and no end -- with forces of the most unnerving kind , which had their origin in an age when the world was different from the world which we know . We are going back to the origin of superstition -- to an age when dragons tore each other in their slime . We must fear nothing -- no conclusion , however improbable , almost impossible it may be . Life and death is hanging on our judgment , not only for ourselves , but for others whom we love . Remember , I count on you as I hope you count on me . '' `` I do , with all confidence . '' `` Then , '' said Sir Nathaniel , `` let us think justly and boldly and fear nothing , however terrifying it may seem . I suppose I am to take as exact in every detail your account of all the strange things which happened whilst you were in Diana 's Grove ? '' `` So far as I know , yes . Of course I may be mistaken in recollection of some detail or another , but I am certain that in the main what I have said is correct . '' `` You feel sure that you saw Lady Arabella seize the negro round the neck , and drag him down with her into the hole ? '' `` Absolutely certain , sir , otherwise I should have gone to her assistance . '' `` We have , then , an account of what happened from an eye-witness whom we trust -- that is yourself . We have also another account , written by Lady Arabella under her own hand . These two accounts do not agree . Therefore we must take it that one of the two is lying . '' `` Apparently , sir . '' `` And that Lady Arabella is the liar ! '' `` Apparently -- as I am not . '' `` We must , therefore , try to find a reason for her lying . She has nothing to fear from Oolanga , who is dead . Therefore the only reason which could actuate her would be to convince someone else that she was blameless . This 'someone ' could not be you , for you had the evidence of your own eyes . There was no one else present ; therefore it must have been an absent person . '' `` That seems beyond dispute , sir . '' `` There is only one other person whose good opinion she could wish to keep -- Edgar Caswall . He is the only one who fills the bill . Her lies point to other things besides the death of the African . She evidently wanted it to be accepted that his falling into the well was his own act . I can not suppose that she expected to convince you , the eye-witness ; but if she wished later on to spread the story , it was wise of her to try to get your acceptance of it . '' `` That is so ! '' `` Then there were other matters of untruth . That , for instance , of the ermine collar embroidered with emeralds . If an understandable reason be required for this , it would be to draw attention away from the green lights which were seen in the room , and especially in the well-hole . Any unprejudiced person would accept the green lights to be the eyes of a great snake , such as tradition pointed to living in the well-hole . In fine , therefore , Lady Arabella wanted the general belief to be that there was no snake of the kind in Diana 's Grove . For my own part , I don't believe in a partial liar -- this art does not deal in veneer ; a liar is a liar right through . Self-interest may prompt falsity of the tongue ; but if one prove to be a liar , nothing that he says can ever be believed . This leads us to the conclusion that because she said or inferred that there was no snake , we should look for one -- and expect to find it , too . `` Now let me digress . I live , and have for many years lived , in Derbyshire , a county more celebrated for its caves than any other county in England . I have been through them all , and am familiar with every turn of them ; as also with other great caves in Kentucky , in France , in Germany , and a host of other places -- in many of these are tremendously deep caves of narrow aperture , which are valued by intrepid explorers , who descend narrow gullets of abysmal depth -- and sometimes never return . In many of the caverns in the Peak I am convinced that some of the smaller passages were used in primeval times as the lairs of some of the great serpents of legend and tradition . It may have been that such caverns were formed in the usual geologic way -- bubbles or flaws in the earth 's crust -- which were later used by the monsters of the period of the young world . It may have been , of course , that some of them were worn originally by water ; but in time they all found a use when suitable for living monsters . `` This brings us to another point , more difficult to accept and understand than any other requiring belief in a base not usually accepted , or indeed entered on -- whether such abnormal growths could have ever changed in their nature . Some day the study of metabolism may progress so far as to enable us to accept structural changes proceeding from an intellectual or moral base . We may lean towards a belief that great animal strength may be a sound base for changes of all sorts . If this be so , what could be a more fitting subject than primeval monsters whose strength was such as to allow a survival of thousands of years ? We do not know yet if brain can increase and develop independently of other parts of the living structure . `` After all , the mediaeval belief in the Philosopher 's Stone which could transmute metals , has its counterpart in the accepted theory of metabolism which changes living tissue . In an age of investigation like our own , when we are returning to science as the base of wonders -- almost of miracles -- we should be slow to refuse to accept facts , however impossible they may seem to be . `` Let us suppose a monster of the early days of the world -- a dragon of the prime -- of vast age running into thousands of years , to whom had been conveyed in some way -- it matters not -- a brain just sufficient for the beginning of growth . Suppose the monster to be of incalculable size and of a strength quite abnormal -- a veritable incarnation of animal strength . Suppose this animal is allowed to remain in one place , thus being removed from accidents of interrupted development ; might not , would not this creature , in process of time -- ages , if necessary -- have that rudimentary intelligence developed ? There is no impossibility in this ; it is only the natural process of evolution . In the beginning , the instincts of animals are confined to alimentation , self-protection , and the multiplication of their species . As time goes on and the needs of life become more complex , power follows need . We have been long accustomed to consider growth as applied almost exclusively to size in its various aspects . But Nature , who has no doctrinaire ideas , may equally apply it to concentration . A developing thing may expand in any given way or form . Now , it is a scientific law that increase implies gain and loss of various kinds ; what a thing gains in one direction it may lose in another . May it not be that Mother Nature may deliberately encourage decrease as well as increase -- that it may be an axiom that what is gained in concentration is lost in size ? Take , for instance , monsters that tradition has accepted and localised , such as the Worm of Lambton or that of Spindleston Heugh . If such a creature were , by its own process of metabolism , to change much of its bulk for intellectual growth , we should at once arrive at a new class of creature -- more dangerous , perhaps , than the world has ever had any experience of -- a force which can think , which has no soul and no morals , and therefore no acceptance of responsibility . A snake would be a good illustration of this , for it is cold-blooded , and therefore removed from the temptations which often weaken or restrict warm-blooded creatures . If , for instance , the Worm of Lambton -- if such ever existed -- were guided to its own ends by an organised intelligence capable of expansion , what form of creature could we imagine which would equal it in potentialities of evil ? Why , such a being would devastate a whole country . Now , all these things require much thought , and we want to apply the knowledge usefully , and we should therefore be exact . Would it not be well to resume the subject later in the day ? '' `` I quite agree , sir . I am in a whirl already ; and want to attend carefully to what you say ; so that I may try to digest it . '' Both men seemed fresher and better for the `` easy , '' and when they met in the afternoon each of them had something to contribute to the general stock of information . Adam , who was by nature of a more militant disposition than his elderly friend , was glad to see that the conference at once assumed a practical trend . Sir Nathaniel recognised this , and , like an old diplomatist , turned it to present use . `` Tell me now , Adam , what is the outcome , in your own mind , of our conversation ? '' `` That the whole difficulty already assumes practical shape ; but with added dangers , that at first I did not imagine . '' `` What is the practical shape , and what are the added dangers ? I am not disputing , but only trying to clear my own ideas by the consideration of yours -- '' So Adam went on : '' In the past , in the early days of the world , there were monsters who were so vast that they could exist for thousands of years . Some of them must have overlapped the Christian era . They may have progressed intellectually in process of time . If they had in any way so progressed , or even got the most rudimentary form of brain , they would be the most dangerous things that ever were in the world . Tradition says that one of these monsters lived in the Marsh of the East , and came up to a cave in Diana 's Grove , which was also called the Lair of the White Worm . Such creatures may have grown down as well as up . They _may_ have grown into , or something like , human beings . Lady Arabella March is of snake nature . She has committed crimes to our knowledge . She retains something of the vast strength of her primal being -- can see in the dark -- has the eyes of a snake . She used the nigger , and then dragged him through the snake's hole down to the swamp ; she is intent on evil , and hates some one we love . Result . . . `` `` Yes , the result ? '' `` First , that Mimi Watford should be taken away at once -- then -- '' '' Yes ? '' `` The monster must be destroyed . '' `` Bravo ! That is a true and fearless conclusion . At whatever cost , it must be carried out . '' `` At once ? '' `` Soon , at all events . That creature 's very existence is a danger . Her presence in this neighbourhood makes the danger immediate . '' As he spoke , Sir Nathaniel 's mouth hardened and his eyebrows came down till they met . There was no doubting his concurrence in the resolution , or his readiness to help in carrying it out . But he was an elderly man with much experience and knowledge of law and diplomacy . It seemed to him to be a stern duty to prevent anything irrevocable taking place till it had been thought out and all was ready . There were all sorts of legal cruxes to be thought out , not only regarding the taking of life , even of a monstrosity in human form , but also of property . Lady Arabella , be she woman or snake or devil , owned the ground she moved in , according to British law , and the law is jealous and swift to avenge wrongs done within its ken . All such difficulties should be -- must be -- avoided for Mr. Salton 's sake , for Adam 's own sake , and , most of all , for Mimi Watford 's sake . Before he spoke again , Sir Nathaniel had made up his mind that he must try to postpone decisive action until the circumstances on which they depended -- which , after all , were only problematical -- should have been tested satisfactorily , one way or another . When he did speak , Adam at first thought that his friend was wavering in his intention , or `` funking '' the responsibility . However , his respect for Sir Nathaniel was so great that he would not act , or even come to a conclusion on a vital point , without his sanction . He came close and whispered in his ear : '' We will prepare our plans to combat and destroy this horrible menace , after we have cleared up some of the more baffling points . Meanwhile , we must wait for the night -- I hear my uncle 's footsteps echoing down the hall . '' Sir Nathaniel nodded his approval . CHAPTER XXI -- GREEN LIGHT When old Mr. Salton had retired for the night , Adam and Sir Nathaniel returned to the study . Things went with great regularity at Lesser Hill , so they knew that there would be no interruption to their talk . When their cigars were lighted , Sir Nathaniel began . `` I hope , Adam , that you do not think me either slack or changeable of purpose . I mean to go through this business to the bitter end -- whatever it may be . Be satisfied that my first care is , and shall be , the protection of Mimi Watford . To that I am pledged ; my dear boy , we who are interested are all in the same danger . That semi-human monster out of the pit hates and means to destroy us all -- you and me certainly , and probably your uncle . I wanted especially to talk with you to-night , for I can not help thinking that the time is fast coming -- if it has not come already -- when we must take your uncle into our confidence . It was one thing when fancied evils threatened , but now he is probably marked for death , and it is only right that he should know all . '' `` I am with you , sir . Things have changed since we agreed to keep him out of the trouble . Now we dare not ; consideration for his feelings might cost his life . It is a duty -- and no light or pleasant one , either . I have not a shadow of doubt that he will want to be one with us in this . But remember , we are his guests ; his name , his honour , have to be thought of as well as his safety . '' `` All shall be as you wish , Adam . And now as to what we are to do ? We can not murder Lady Arabella off-hand . Therefore we shall have to put things in order for the killing , and in such a way that we can not be taxed with a crime . '' `` It seems to me , sir , that we are in an exceedingly tight place . Our first difficulty is to know where to begin . I never thought this fighting an antediluvian monster would be such a complicated job . This one is a woman , with all a woman 's wit , combined with the heartlessness of a _cocotte_ . She has the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus . We may be sure that in the fight that is before us there will be no semblance of fair-play . Also that our unscrupulous opponent will not betray herself ! '' `` That is so -- but being feminine , she will probably over-reach herself . Now , Adam , it strikes me that , as we have to protect ourselves and others against feminine nature , our strong game will be to play our masculine against her feminine . Perhaps we had better sleep on it . She is a thing of the night ; and the night may give us some ideas . '' So they both turned in . Adam knocked at Sir Nathaniel 's door in the grey of the morning , and , on being bidden , came into the room . He had several letters in his hand . Sir Nathaniel sat up in bed . `` Well ! '' `` I should like to read you a few letters , but , of course , I shall not send them unless you approve . In fact '' -- with a smile and a blush -- '' there are several things which I want to do ; but I hold my hand and my tongue till I have your approval . '' `` Go on ! '' said the other kindly . `` Tell me all , and count at any rate on my sympathy , and on my approval and help if I can see my way . '' Accordingly Adam proceeded : '' When I told you the conclusions at which I had arrived , I put in the foreground that Mimi Watford should , for the sake of her own safety , be removed -- and that the monster which had wrought all the harm should be destroyed . '' `` Yes , that is so . '' `` To carry this into practice , sir , one preliminary is required -- unless harm of another kind is to be faced . Mimi should have some protector whom all the world would recognise . The only form recognised by convention is marriage ! '' Sir Nathaniel smiled in a fatherly way . `` To marry , a husband is required . And that husband should be you . '' `` Yes , yes . '' `` And the marriage should be immediate and secret -- or , at least , not spoken of outside ourselves . Would the young lady be agreeable to that proceeding ? '' `` I do not know , sir ! '' `` Then how are we to proceed ? '' `` I suppose that we -- or one of us -- must ask her . '' `` Is this a sudden idea , Adam , a sudden resolution ? '' `` A sudden resolution , sir , but not a sudden idea . If she agrees , all is well and good . The sequence is obvious . '' `` And it is to be kept a secret amongst ourselves ? '' `` I want no secret , sir , except for Mimi 's good . For myself , I should like to shout it from the house-tops ! But we must be discreet ; untimely knowledge to our enemy might work incalculable harm . '' `` And how would you suggest , Adam , that we could combine the momentous question with secrecy ? '' Adam grew red and moved uneasily . `` Someone must ask her -- as soon as possible ! '' `` And that someone ? '' `` I thought that you , sir , would be so good ! '' `` God bless my soul ! This is a new kind of duty to take on -- at my time of life . Adam , I hope you know that you can count on me to help in any way I can ! '' `` I have already counted on you , sir , when I ventured to make such a suggestion . I can only ask , '' he added , `` that you will be more than ever kind to me -- to us -- and look on the painful duty as a voluntary act of grace , prompted by kindness and affection . '' `` Painful duty ! '' `` Yes , '' said Adam boldly . `` Painful to you , though to me it would be all joyful . '' `` It is a strange job for an early morning ! Well , we all live and learn . I suppose the sooner I go the better . You had better write a line for me to take with me . For , you see , this is to be a somewhat unusual transaction , and it may be embarrassing to the lady , even to myself . So we ought to have some sort of warrant , something to show that we have been mindful of her feelings . It will not do to take acquiescence for granted -- although we act for her good . '' `` Sir Nathaniel , you are a true friend ; I am sure that both Mimi and I shall be grateful to you for all our lives -- however long they may be ! '' So the two talked it over and agreed as to points to be borne in mind by the ambassador . It was striking ten when Sir Nathaniel left the house , Adam seeing him quietly off . As the young man followed him with wistful eyes -- almost jealous of the privilege which his kind deed was about to bring him -- he felt that his own heart was in his friend 's breast . The memory of that morning was like a dream to all those concerned in it . Sir Nathaniel had a confused recollection of detail and sequence , though the main facts stood out in his memory boldly and clearly . Adam Salton's recollection was of an illimitable wait , filled with anxiety , hope , and chagrin , all dominated by a sense of the slow passage of time and accompanied by vague fears . Mimi could not for a long time think at all , or recollect anything , except that Adam loved her and was saving her from a terrible danger . When she had time to think , later on , she wondered when she had any ignorance of the fact that Adam loved her , and that she loved him with all her heart . Everything , every recollection however small , every feeling , seemed to fit into those elemental facts as though they had all been moulded together . The main and crowning recollection was her saying goodbye to Sir Nathaniel , and entrusting to him loving messages , straight from her heart , to Adam Salton , and of his bearing when -- with an impulse which she could not check -- she put her lips to his and kissed him . Later , when she was alone and had time to think , it was a passing grief to her that she would have to be silent , for a time , to Lilla on the happy events of that strange mission . She had , of course , agreed to keep all secret until Adam should give her leave to speak . The advice and assistance of Sir Nathaniel was a great help to Adam in carrying out his idea of marrying Mimi Watford without publicity . He went with him to London , and , with his influence , the young man obtained the license of the Archbishop of Canterbury for a private marriage . Sir Nathaniel then persuaded old Mr. Salton to allow his nephew to spend a few weeks with him at Doom Tower , and it was here that Mimi became Adam's wife . But that was only the first step in their plans ; before going further , however , Adam took his bride off to the Isle of Man . He wished to place a stretch of sea between Mimi and the White Worm , while things matured . On their return , Sir Nathaniel met them and drove them at once to Doom , taking care to avoid any one that he knew on the journey . Sir Nathaniel had taken care to have the doors and windows shut and locked -- all but the door used for their entry . The shutters were up and the blinds down . Moreover , heavy curtains were drawn across the windows . When Adam commented on this , Sir Nathaniel said in a whisper : '' Wait till we are alone , and I 'll tell you why this is done ; in the meantime not a word or a sign . You will approve when we have had a talk together . '' They said no more on the subject till after dinner , when they were ensconced in Sir Nathaniel 's study , which was on the top storey . Doom Tower was a lofty structure , situated on an eminence high up in the Peak . The top commanded a wide prospect , ranging from the hills above the Ribble to the near side of the Brow , which marked the northern bound of ancient Mercia . It was of the early Norman period , less than a century younger than Castra Regis . The windows of the study were barred and locked , and heavy dark curtains closed them in . When this was done not a gleam of light from the tower could be seen from outside . When they were alone , Sir Nathaniel explained that he had taken his old friend , Mr. Salton , into full confidence , and that in future all would work together . `` It is important for you to be extremely careful . In spite of the fact that our marriage was kept secret , as also your temporary absence , both are known . '' `` How ? To whom ? '' `` How , I know not ; but I am beginning to have an idea . '' `` To her ? '' asked Adam , in momentary consternation . Sir Nathaniel shivered perceptibly . `` The White Worm -- yes ! '' Adam noticed that from now on , his friend never spoke of Lady Arabella otherwise , except when he wished to divert the suspicion of others . Sir Nathaniel switched off the electric light , and when the room was pitch dark , he came to Adam , took him by the hand , and led him to a seat set in the southern window . Then he softly drew back a piece of the curtain and motioned his companion to look out . Adam did so , and immediately shrank back as though his eyes had opened on pressing danger . His companion set his mind at rest by saying in a low voice : '' It is all right ; you may speak , but speak low . There is no danger here -- at present ! '' Adam leaned forward , taking care , however , not to press his face against the glass . What he saw would not under ordinary circumstances have caused concern to anybody . With his special knowledge , it was appalling -- though the night was now so dark that in reality there was little to be seen . On the western side of the tower stood a grove of old trees , of forest dimensions . They were not grouped closely , but stood a little apart from each other , producing the effect of a row widely planted . Over the tops of them was seen a green light , something like the danger signal at a railway-crossing . It seemed at first quite still ; but presently , when Adam 's eye became accustomed to it , he could see that it moved as if trembling . This at once recalled to Adam 's mind the light quivering above the well-hole in the darkness of that inner room at Diana 's Grove , Oolanga 's awful shriek , and the hideous black face , now grown grey with terror , disappearing into the impenetrable gloom of the mysterious orifice . Instinctively he laid his hand on his revolver , and stood up ready to protect his wife . Then , seeing that nothing happened , and that the light and all outside the tower remained the same , he softly pulled the curtain over the window . Sir Nathaniel switched on the light again , and in its comforting glow they began to talk freely . CHAPTER XXII -- AT CLOSE QUARTERS '' She has diabolical cunning , '' said Sir Nathaniel . `` Ever since you left , she has ranged along the Brow and wherever you were accustomed to frequent . I have not heard whence the knowledge of your movements came to her , nor have I been able to learn any data whereon to found an opinion . She seems to have heard both of your marriage and your absence ; but I gather , by inference , that she does not actually know where you and Mimi are , or of your return . So soon as the dusk fails , she goes out on her rounds , and before dawn covers the whole ground round the Brow , and away up into the heart of the Peak . The White Worm , in her own proper shape , certainly has great facilities for the business on which she is now engaged . She can look into windows of any ordinary kind . Happily , this house is beyond her reach , if she wishes -- as she manifestly does -- to remain unrecognised . But , even at this height , it is wise to show no lights , lest she might learn something of our presence or absence . '' `` Would it not be well , sir , if one of us could see this monster in her real shape at close quarters ? I am willing to run the risk -- for I take it there would be no slight risk in the doing . I do n't suppose anyone of our time has seen her close and lived to tell the tale . '' Sir Nathaniel held up an expostulatory hand . `` Good God , lad , what are you suggesting ? Think of your wife , and all that is at stake . '' `` It is of Mimi that I think -- for her sake that I am willing to risk whatever is to be risked . '' Adam 's young bride was proud of her man , but she blanched at the thought of the ghastly White Worm . Adam saw this and at once reassured her . `` So long as her ladyship does not know whereabout I am , I shall have as much safety as remains to us ; bear in mind , my darling , that we can not be too careful . '' Sir Nathaniel realised that Adam was right ; the White Worm had no supernatural powers and could not harm them until she discovered their hiding place . It was agreed , therefore , that the two men should go together . When the two men slipped out by the back door of the house , they walked cautiously along the avenue which trended towards the west . Everything was pitch dark -- so dark that at times they had to feel their way by the palings and tree-trunks . They could still see , seemingly far in front of them and high up , the baleful light which at the height and distance seemed like a faint line . As they were now on the level of the ground , the light seemed infinitely higher than it had from the top of the tower . At the sight Adam 's heart fell ; the danger of the desperate enterprise which he had undertaken burst upon him . But this feeling was shortly followed by another which restored him to himself -- a fierce loathing , and a desire to kill , such as he had never experienced before . They went on for some distance on a level road , fairly wide , from which the green light was visible . Here Sir Nathaniel spoke softly , placing his lips to Adam 's ear for safety . `` We know nothing whatever of this creature 's power of hearing or smelling , though I presume that both are of no great strength . As to seeing , we may presume the opposite , but in any case we must try to keep in the shade behind the tree-trunks . The slightest error would be fatal to us . '' Adam only nodded , in case there should be any chance of the monster seeing the movement . After a time that seemed interminable , they emerged from the circling wood . It was like coming out into sunlight by comparison with the misty blackness which had been around them . There was light enough to see by , though not sufficient to distinguish things at a distance . Adam 's eyes sought the green light in the sky . It was still in about the same place , but its surroundings were more visible . It was now at the summit of what seemed to be a long white pole , near the top of which were two pendant white masses , like rudimentary arms or fins . The green light , strangely enough , did not seem lessened by the surrounding starlight , but had a clearer effect and a deeper green . Whilst they were carefully regarding this -- Adam with the aid of an opera-glass -- their nostrils were assailed by a horrid stench , something like that which rose from the well-hole in Diana 's Grove . By degrees , as their eyes got the right focus , they saw an immense towering mass that seemed snowy white . It was tall and thin . The lower part was hidden by the trees which lay between , but they could follow the tall white shaft and the duplicate green lights which topped it . As they looked there was a movement -- the shaft seemed to bend , and the line of green light descended amongst the trees . They could see the green light twinkle as it passed between the obstructing branches . Seeing where the head of the monster was , the two men ventured a little further forward , and saw that the hidden mass at the base of the shaft was composed of vast coils of the great serpent 's body , forming a base from which the upright mass rose . As they looked , this lower mass moved , the glistening folds catching the moonlight , and they could see that the monster 's progress was along the ground . It was coming towards them at a swift pace , so they turned and ran , taking care to make as little noise as possible , either by their footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth close to them . They did not stop or pause till they saw before them the high dark tower of Doom . CHAPTER XXIII -- IN THE ENEMY 'S HOUSE Sir Nathaniel was in the library next morning , after breakfast , when Adam came to him carrying a letter . `` Her ladyship does n't lose any time . She has begun work already ! '' Sir Nathaniel , who was writing at a table near the window , looked up . `` What is it ? '' said he . Adam held out the letter he was carrying . It was in a blazoned envelope . `` Ha ! '' said Sir Nathaniel , `` from the White Worm ! I expected something of the kind . '' `` But , '' said Adam , `` how could she have known we were here ? She didn't know last night . '' `` I do n't think we need trouble about that , Adam . There is so much we do not understand . This is only another mystery . Suffice it that she does know -- perhaps it is all the better and safer for us . '' `` How is that ? '' asked Adam with a puzzled look . `` General process of reasoning , my boy ; and the experience of some years in the diplomatic world . This creature is a monster without heart or consideration for anything or anyone . She is not nearly so dangerous in the open as when she has the dark to protect her . Besides , we know , by our own experience of her movements , that for some reason she shuns publicity . In spite of her vast bulk and abnormal strength , she is afraid to attack openly . After all , she is only a snake and with a snake 's nature , which is to keep low and squirm , and proceed by stealth and cunning . She will never attack when she can run away , although she knows well that running away would probably be fatal to her . What is the letter about ? '' Sir Nathaniel 's voice was calm and self-possessed . When he was engaged in any struggle of wits he was all diplomatist . `` She asks Mimi and me to tea this afternoon at Diana 's Grove , and hopes that you also will favour her . '' Sir Nathaniel smiled . `` Please ask Mrs. Salton to accept for us all . '' `` She means some deadly mischief . Surely -- surely it would be wiser not . '' `` It is an old trick that we learn early in diplomacy , Adam -- to fight on ground of your own choice . It is true that she suggested the place on this occasion ; but by accepting it we make it ours . Moreover , she will not be able to understand our reason for doing so , and her own bad conscience -- if she has any , bad or good -- and her own fears and doubts will play our game for us . No , my dear boy , let us accept , by all means . '' Adam said nothing , but silently held out his hand , which his companion shook : no words were necessary . When it was getting near tea-time , Mimi asked Sir Nathaniel how they were going . `` We must make a point of going in state . We want all possible publicity . '' Mimi looked at him inquiringly . `` Certainly , my dear , in the present circumstances publicity is a part of safety . Do not be surprised if , whilst we are at Diana 's Grove , occasional messages come for you -- for all or any of us . '' `` I see ! '' said Mrs. Salton . `` You are taking no chances . '' `` None , my dear . All I have learned at foreign courts , and amongst civilised and uncivilised people , is going to be utilised within the next couple of hours . '' Sir Nathaniel 's voice was full of seriousness , and it brought to Mimi in a convincing way the awful gravity of the occasion . In due course , they set out in a carriage drawn by a fine pair of horses , who soon devoured the few miles of their journey . Before they came to the gate , Sir Nathaniel turned to Mimi . `` I have arranged with Adam certain signals which may be necessary if certain eventualities occur . These need be nothing to do with you directly . But bear in mind that if I ask you or Adam to do anything , do not lose a second in the doing of it . We must try to pass off such moments with an appearance of unconcern . In all probability , nothing requiring such care will occur . The White Worm will not try force , though she has so much of it to spare . Whatever she may attempt to-day , of harm to any of us , will be in the way of secret plot . Some other time she may try force , but -- if I am able to judge such a thing -- not to-day . The messengers who may ask for any of us will not be witnesses only , they may help to stave off danger . '' Seeing query in her face , he went on : `` Of what kind the danger may be , I know not , and can not guess . It will doubtless be some ordinary circumstance ; but none the less dangerous on that account . Here we are at the gate . Now , be careful in all matters , however small . To keep your head is half the battle . '' There were a number of men in livery in the hall when they arrived . The doors of the drawing-room were thrown open , and Lady Arabella came forth and offered them cordial welcome . This having been got over , Lady Arabella led them into another room where tea was served . Adam was acutely watchful and suspicious of everything , and saw on the far side of this room a panelled iron door of the same colour and configuration as the outer door of the room where was the well-hole wherein Oolanga had disappeared . Something in the sight alarmed him , and he quietly stood near the door . He made no movement , even of his eyes , but he could see that Sir Nathaniel was watching him intently , and , he fancied , with approval . They all sat near the table spread for tea , Adam still near the door . Lady Arabella fanned herself , complaining of heat , and told one of the footmen to throw all the outer doors open . Tea was in progress when Mimi suddenly started up with a look of fright on her face ; at the same moment , the men became cognisant of a thick smoke which began to spread through the room -- a smoke which made those who experienced it gasp and choke . The footmen began to edge uneasily towards the inner door . Denser and denser grew the smoke , and more acrid its smell . Mimi , towards whom the draught from the open door wafted the smoke , rose up choking , and ran to the inner door , which she threw open to its fullest extent , disclosing on the outside a curtain of thin silk , fixed to the doorposts . The draught from the open door swayed the thin silk towards her , and in her fright , she tore down the curtain , which enveloped her from head to foot . Then she ran through the still open door , heedless of the fact that she could not see where she was going . Adam , followed by Sir Nathaniel , rushed forward and joined her -- Adam catching his wife by the arm and holding her tight . It was well that he did so , for just before her lay the black orifice of the well-hole , which , of course , she could not see with the silk curtain round her head . The floor was extremely slippery ; something like thick oil had been spilled where she had to pass ; and close to the edge of the hole her feet shot from under her , and she stumbled forward towards the well-hole . When Adam saw Mimi slip , he flung himself backward , still holding her . His weight told , and he dragged her up from the hole and they fell together on the floor outside the zone of slipperiness . In a moment he had raised her up , and together they rushed out through the open door into the sunlight , Sir Nathaniel close behind them . They were all pale except the old diplomatist , who looked both calm and cool . It sustained and cheered Adam and his wife to see him thus master of himself . Both managed to follow his example , to the wonderment of the footmen , who saw the three who had just escaped a terrible danger walking together gaily , as , under the guiding pressure of Sir Nathaniel 's hand , they turned to re- enter the house . Lady Arabella , whose face had blanched to a deadly white , now resumed her ministrations at the tea-board as though nothing unusual had happened . The slop-basin was full of half-burned brown paper , over which tea had been poured . Sir Nathaniel had been narrowly observing his hostess , and took the first opportunity afforded him of whispering to Adam : '' The real attack is to come -- she is too quiet . When I give my hand to your wife to lead her out , come with us -- and caution her to hurry . Don't lose a second , even if you have to make a scene . Hs-s-s-h ! '' Then they resumed their places close to the table , and the servants , in obedience to Lady Arabella 's order , brought in fresh tea . Thence on , that tea-party seemed to Adam , whose faculties were at their utmost intensity , like a terrible dream . As for poor Mimi , she was so overwrought both with present and future fear , and with horror at the danger she had escaped , that her faculties were numb . However , she was braced up for a trial , and she felt assured that whatever might come she would be able to go through with it . Sir Nathaniel seemed just as usual -- suave , dignified , and thoughtful -- perfect master of himself . To her husband , it was evident that Mimi was ill at ease . The way she kept turning her head to look around her , the quick coming and going of the colour of her face , her hurried breathing , alternating with periods of suspicious calm , were evidences of mental perturbation . To her , the attitude of Lady Arabella seemed compounded of social sweetness and personal consideration . It would be hard to imagine more thoughtful and tender kindness towards an honoured guest . When tea was over and the servants had come to clear away the cups , Lady Arabella , putting her arm round Mimi 's waist , strolled with her into an adjoining room , where she collected a number of photographs which were scattered about , and , sitting down beside her guest , began to show them to her . While she was doing this , the servants closed all the doors of the suite of rooms , as well as that which opened from the room outside -- that of the well-hole into the avenue . Suddenly , without any seeming cause , the light in the room began to grow dim . Sir Nathaniel , who was sitting close to Mimi , rose to his feet , and , crying , `` Quick ! '' caught hold of her hand and began to drag her from the room . Adam caught her other hand , and between them they drew her through the outer door which the servants were beginning to close . It was difficult at first to find the way , the darkness was so great ; but to their relief when Adam whistled shrilly , the carriage and horses , which had been waiting in the angle of the avenue , dashed up . Her husband and Sir Nathaniel lifted -- almost threw -- Mimi into the carriage . The postillion plied whip and spur , and the vehicle , rocking with its speed , swept through the gate and tore up the road . Behind them was a hubbub -- servants rushing about , orders being shouted out , doors shutting , and somewhere , seemingly far back in the house , a strange noise . Every nerve of the horses was strained as they dashed recklessly along the road . The two men held Mimi between them , the arms of both of them round her as though protectingly . As they went , there was a sudden rise in the ground ; but the horses , breathing heavily , dashed up it at racing speed , not slackening their pace when the hill fell away again , leaving them to hurry along the downgrade . It would be foolish to say that neither Adam nor Mimi had any fear in returning to Doom Tower . Mimi felt it more keenly than her husband , whose nerves were harder , and who was more inured to danger . Still she bore up bravely , and as usual the effort was helpful to her . When once she was in the study in the top of the turret , she almost forgot the terrors which lay outside in the dark . She did not attempt to peep out of the window ; but Adam did -- and saw nothing . The moonlight showed all the surrounding country , but nowhere was to be observed that tremulous line of green light . The peaceful night had a good effect on them all ; danger , being unseen , seemed far off . At times it was hard to realise that it had ever been . With courage restored , Adam rose early and walked along the Brow , seeing no change in the signs of life in Castra Regis . What he did see , to his wonder and concern , on his returning homeward , was Lady Arabella , in her tight-fitting white dress and ermine collar , but without her emeralds ; she was emerging from the gate of Diana 's Grove and walking towards the Castle . Pondering on this , and trying to find some meaning in it , occupied his thoughts till he joined Mimi and Sir Nathaniel at breakfast . They began the meal in silence . What had been had been , and was known to them all . Moreover , it was not a pleasant topic . A fillip was given to the conversation when Adam told of his seeing Lady Arabella , on her way to Castra Regis . They each had something to say of her , and of what her wishes or intentions were towards Edgar Caswall . Mimi spoke bitterly of her in every aspect . She had not forgotten -- and never would -- never could -- the occasion when , to harm Lilla , the woman had consorted even with the nigger . As a social matter , she was disgusted with her for following up the rich landowner -- '' throwing herself at his head so shamelessly , '' was how she expressed it . She was interested to know that the great kite still flew from Caswall 's tower . But beyond such matters she did not try to go . The only comment she made was of strongly expressed surprise at her ladyship 's `` cheek '' in ignoring her own criminal acts , and her impudence in taking it for granted that others had overlooked them also . CHAPTER XXIV -- A STARTLING PROPOSITION The more Mimi thought over the late events , the more puzzled she was . What did it all mean -- what could it mean , except that there was an error of fact somewhere . Could it be possible that some of them -- all of them had been mistaken , that there had been no White Worm at all ? On either side of her was a belief impossible of reception . Not to believe in what seemed apparent was to destroy the very foundations of belief . . . yet in old days there had been monsters on the earth , and certainly some people had believed in just such mysterious changes of identity . It was all very strange . Just fancy how any stranger -- say a doctor -- would regard her , if she were to tell him that she had been to a tea-party with an antediluvian monster , and that they had been waited on by up-to-date men-servants . Adam had returned , exhilarated by his walk , and more settled in his mind than he had been for some time . Like Mimi , he had gone through the phase of doubt and inability to believe in the reality of things , though it had not affected him to the same extent . The idea , however , that his wife was suffering ill-effects from her terrible ordeal , braced him up . He remained with her for a time , then he sought Sir Nathaniel in order to talk over the matter with him . He knew that the calm common sense and self-reliance of the old man , as well as his experience , would be helpful to them all . Sir Nathaniel had come to the conclusion that , for some reason which he did not understand , Lady Arabella had changed her plans , and , for the present at all events , was pacific . He was inclined to attribute her changed demeanour to the fact that her influence over Edgar Caswall was so far increased , as to justify a more fixed belief in his submission to her charms . As a matter of fact , she had seen Caswall that morning when she visited Castra Regis , and they had had a long talk together , during which the possibility of their union had been discussed . Caswall , without being enthusiastic on the subject , had been courteous and attentive ; as she had walked back to Diana 's Grove , she almost congratulated herself on her new settlement in life . That the idea was becoming fixed in her mind , was shown by a letter which she wrote later in the day to Adam Salton , and sent to him by hand . It ran as follows : `` DEAR MR. SALTON , `` I wonder if you would kindly advise , and , if possible , help me in a matter of business . I have been for some time trying to make up my mind to sell Diana 's Grove , I have put off and put off the doing of it till now . The place is my own property , and no one has to be consulted with regard to what I may wish to do about it . It was bought by my late husband , Captain Adolphus Ranger March , who had another residence , The Crest , Appleby . He acquired all rights of all kinds , including mining and sporting . When he died , he left his whole property to me . I shall feel leaving this place , which has become endeared to me by many sacred memories and affections -- the recollection of many happy days of my young married life , and the more than happy memories of the man I loved and who loved me so much . I should be willing to sell the place for any fair price -- so long , of course , as the purchaser was one I liked and of whom I approved . May I say that you yourself would be the ideal person . But I dare not hope for so much . It strikes me , however , that among your Australian friends may be someone who wishes to make a settlement in the Old Country , and would care to fix the spot in one of the most historic regions in England , full of romance and legend , and with a never-ending vista of historical interest -- an estate which , though small , is in perfect condition and with illimitable possibilities of development , and many doubtful -- or unsettled -- rights which have existed before the time of the Romans or even Celts , who were the original possessors . In addition , the house has been kept up to the _dernier cri_ . Immediate possession can be arranged . My lawyers can provide you , or whoever you may suggest , with all business and historical details . A word from you of acceptance or refusal is all that is necessary , and we can leave details to be thrashed out by our agents . Forgive me , wo n't you , for troubling you in the matter , and believe me , yours very sincerely . `` ARABELLA MARCH . '' Adam read this over several times , and then , his mind being made up , he went to Mimi and asked if she had any objection . She answered -- after a shudder -- that she was , in this , as in all things , willing to do whatever he might wish . `` Dearest , I am willing that you should judge what is best for us . Be quite free to act as you see your duty , and as your inclination calls . We are in the hands of God , and He has hitherto guided us , and will do so to His own end . '' From his wife 's room Adam Salton went straight to the study in the tower , where he knew Sir Nathaniel would be at that hour . The old man was alone , so , when he had entered in obedience to the `` Come in , '' which answered his query , he closed the door and sat down beside him . `` Do you think , sir , that it would be well for me to buy Diana 's Grove ? '' `` God bless my soul ! '' said the old man , startled , `` why on earth would you want to do that ? '' `` Well , I have vowed to destroy that White Worm , and my being able to do whatever I may choose with the Lair would facilitate matters and avoid complications . '' Sir Nathaniel hesitated longer than usual before speaking . He was thinking deeply . `` Yes , Adam , there is much common sense in your suggestion , though it startled me at first . I think that , for all reasons , you would do well to buy the property and to have the conveyance settled at once . If you want more money than is immediately convenient , let me know , so that I may be your banker . '' `` Thank you , sir , most heartily ; but I have more money at immediate call than I shall want . I am glad you approve . '' `` The property is historic , and as time goes on it will increase in value . Moreover , I may tell you something , which indeed is only a surmise , but which , if I am right , will add great value to the place . '' Adam listened . `` Has it ever struck you why the old name , 'The Lair of the White Worm , ' was given ? We know that there was a snake which in early days was called a worm ; but why white ? '' `` I really do n't know , sir ; I never thought of it . I simply took it for granted . '' `` So did I at first -- long ago . But later I puzzled my brain for a reason . '' `` And what was the reason , sir ? '' `` Simply and solely because the snake or worm _was_ white . We are near the county of Stafford , where the great industry of china-burning was originated and grew . Stafford owes much of its wealth to the large deposits of the rare china clay found in it from time to time . These deposits become in time pretty well exhausted ; but for centuries Stafford adventurers looked for the special clay , as Ohio and Pennsylvania farmers and explorers looked for oil . Anyone owning real estate on which china clay can be discovered strikes a sort of gold mine . '' `` Yes , and then -- '' The young man looked puzzled . `` The original 'Worm ' so-called , from which the name of the place came , had to find a direct way down to the marshes and the mud-holes . Now , the clay is easily penetrable , and the original hole probably pierced a bed of china clay . When once the way was made it would become a sort of highway for the Worm . But as much movement was necessary to ascend such a great height , some of the clay would become attached to its rough skin by attrition . The downway must have been easy work , but the ascent was different , and when the monster came to view in the upper world , it would be fresh from contact with the white clay . Hence the name , which has no cryptic significance , but only fact . Now , if that surmise be true -- and I do not see why not -- there must be a deposit of valuable clay -- possibly of immense depth . '' Adam 's comment pleased the old gentleman . `` I have it in my bones , sir , that you have struck -- or rather reasoned out -- a great truth . '' Sir Nathaniel went on cheerfully . `` When the world of commerce wakes up to the value of your find , it will be as well that your title to ownership has been perfectly secured . If anyone ever deserved such a gain , it is you . '' With his friend 's aid , Adam secured the property without loss of time . Then he went to see his uncle , and told him about it . Mr. Salton was delighted to find his young relative already constructively the owner of so fine an estate -- one which gave him an important status in the county . He made many anxious enquiries about Mimi , and the doings of the White Worm , but Adam reassured him . The next morning , when Adam went to his host in the smoking-room , Sir Nathaniel asked him how he purposed to proceed with regard to keeping his vow . `` It is a difficult matter which you have undertaken . To destroy such a monster is something like one of the labours of Hercules , in that not only its size and weight and power of using them in little-known ways are against you , but the occult side is alone an unsurpassable difficulty . The Worm is already master of all the elements except fire -- and I do not see how fire can be used for the attack . It has only to sink into the earth in its usual way , and you could not overtake it if you had the resources of the biggest coal-mine in existence . But I daresay you have mapped out some plan in your mind , '' he added courteously . `` I have , sir . But , of course , it may not stand the test of practice . '' `` May I know the idea ? '' `` Well , sir , this was my argument : At the time of the Chartist trouble , an idea spread amongst financial circles that an attack was going to be made on the Bank of England . Accordingly , the directors of that institution consulted many persons who were supposed to know what steps should be taken , and it was finally decided that the best protection against fire -- which is what was feared -- was not water but sand . To carry the scheme into practice great store of fine sea-sand -- the kind that blows about and is used to fill hour-glasses -- was provided throughout the building , especially at the points liable to attack , from which it could be brought into use . `` I propose to provide at Diana 's Grove , as soon as it comes into my possession , an enormous amount of such sand , and shall take an early occasion of pouring it into the well-hole , which it will in time choke . Thus Lady Arabella , in her guise of the White Worm , will find herself cut off from her refuge . The hole is a narrow one , and is some hundreds of feet deep . The weight of the sand this can contain would not in itself be sufficient to obstruct ; but the friction of such a body working up against it would be tremendous . '' `` One moment . What use would the sand be for destruction ? '' `` None , directly ; but it would hold the struggling body in place till the rest of my scheme came into practice . '' `` And what is the rest ? '' `` As the sand is being poured into the well-hole , quantities of dynamite can also be thrown in ! '' `` Good . But how would the dynamite explode -- for , of course , that is what you intend . Would not some sort of wire or fuse he required for each parcel of dynamite ? '' Adam smiled . `` Not in these days , sir . That was proved in New York . A thousand pounds of dynamite , in sealed canisters , was placed about some workings . At the last a charge of gunpowder was fired , and the concussion exploded the dynamite . It was most successful . Those who were non-experts in high explosives expected that every pane of glass in New York would be shattered . But , in reality , the explosive did no harm outside the area intended , although sixteen acres of rock had been mined and only the supporting walls and pillars had been left intact . The whole of the rocks were shattered . '' Sir Nathaniel nodded approval . `` That seems a good plan -- a very excellent one . But if it has to tear down so many feet of precipice , it may wreck the whole neighbourhood . '' `` And free it for ever from a monster , '' added Adam , as he left the room to find his wife . CHAPTER XXV -- THE LAST BATTLE Lady Arabella had instructed her solicitors to hurry on with the conveyance of Diana 's Grove , so no time was lost in letting Adam Salton have formal possession of the estate . After his interview with Sir Nathaniel , he had taken steps to begin putting his plan into action . In order to accumulate the necessary amount of fine sea-sand , he ordered the steward to prepare for an elaborate system of top-dressing all the grounds . A great heap of the sand , brought from bays on the Welsh coast , began to grow at the back of the Grove . No one seemed to suspect that it was there for any purpose other than what had been given out . Lady Arabella , who alone could have guessed , was now so absorbed in her matrimonial pursuit of Edgar Caswall , that she had neither time nor inclination for thought extraneous to this . She had not yet moved from the house , though she had formally handed over the estate . Adam put up a rough corrugated-iron shed behind the Grove , in which he stored his explosives . All being ready for his great attempt whenever the time should come , he was now content to wait , and , in order to pass the time , interested himself in other things -- even in Caswall 's great kite , which still flew from the high tower of Castra Regis . The mound of fine sand grew to proportions so vast as to puzzle the bailiffs and farmers round the Brow . The hour of the intended cataclysm was approaching apace . Adam wished -- but in vain -- for an opportunity , which would appear to be natural , of visiting Caswall in the turret of Castra Regis . At last , one morning , he met Lady Arabella moving towards the Castle , so he took his courage _a deux mains_ and asked to be allowed to accompany her . She was glad , for her own purposes , to comply with his wishes . So together they entered , and found their way to the turret-room . Caswall was much surprised to see Adam come to his house , but lent himself to the task of seeming to be pleased . He played the host so well as to deceive even Adam . They all went out on the turret roof , where he explained to his guests the mechanism for raising and lowering the kite , taking also the opportunity of testing the movements of the multitudes of birds , how they answered almost instantaneously to the lowering or raising of the kite . As Lady Arabella walked home with Adam from Castra Regis , she asked him if she might make a request . Permission having been accorded , she explained that before she finally left Diana 's Grove , where she had lived so long , she had a desire to know the depth of the well-hole . Adam was really happy to meet her wishes , not from any sentiment , but because he wished to give some valid and ostensible reason for examining the passage of the Worm , which would obviate any suspicion resulting from his being on the premises . He brought from London a Kelvin sounding apparatus , with a sufficient length of piano-wire for testing any probable depth . The wire passed easily over the running wheel , and when this was once fixed over the hole , he was satisfied to wait till the most advantageous time for his final experiment . * * * * * In the meantime , affairs had been going quietly at Mercy Farm . Lilla , of course , felt lonely in the absence of her cousin , but the even tenor of life went on for her as for others . After the first shock of parting was over , things went back to their accustomed routine . In one respect , however , there was a marked difference . So long as home conditions had remained unchanged , Lilla was content to put ambition far from her , and to settle down to the life which had been hers as long as she could remember . But Mimi 's marriage set her thinking ; naturally , she came to the conclusion that she too might have a mate . There was not for her much choice -- there was little movement in the matrimonial direction at the farmhouse . She did not approve of the personality of Edgar Caswall , and his struggle with Mimi had frightened her ; but he was unmistakably an excellent _parti_ , much better than she could have any right to expect . This weighs much with a woman , and more particularly one of her class . So , on the whole , she was content to let things take their course , and to abide by the issue . As time went on , she had reason to believe that things did not point to happiness . She could not shut her eyes to certain disturbing facts , amongst which were the existence of Lady Arabella and her growing intimacy with Edgar Caswall ; as well as his own cold and haughty nature , so little in accord with the ardour which is the foundation of a young maid 's dreams of happiness . How things would , of necessity , alter if she were to marry , she was afraid to think . All told , the prospect was not happy for her , and she had a secret longing that something might occur to upset the order of things as at present arranged . When Lilla received a note from Edgar Caswall asking if he might come to tea on the following afternoon , her heart sank within her . If it was only for her father 's sake , she must not refuse him or show any disinclination which he might construe into incivility . She missed Mimi more than she could say or even dared to think . Hitherto , she had always looked to her cousin for sympathy , for understanding , for loyal support . Now she and all these things , and a thousand others -- gentle , assuring , supporting -- were gone . And instead there was a horrible aching void . For the whole afternoon and evening , and for the following forenoon , poor Lilla 's loneliness grew to be a positive agony . For the first time she began to realise the sense of her loss , as though all the previous suffering had been merely a preparation . Everything she looked at , everything she remembered or thought of , became laden with poignant memory . Then on the top of all was a new sense of dread . The reaction from the sense of security , which had surrounded her all her life , to a never-quieted apprehension , was at times almost more than she could bear . It so filled her with fear that she had a haunting feeling that she would as soon die as live . However , whatever might be her own feelings , duty had to be done , and as she had been brought up to consider duty first , she braced herself to go through , to the very best of her ability , what was before her . Still , the severe and prolonged struggle for self-control told upon Lilla . She looked , as she felt , ill and weak . She was really in a nerveless and prostrate condition , with black circles round her eyes , pale even to her lips , and with an instinctive trembling which she was quite unable to repress . It was for her a sad mischance that Mimi was away , for her love would have seen through all obscuring causes , and have brought to light the girl 's unhappy condition of health . Lilla was utterly unable to do anything to escape from the ordeal before her ; but her cousin , with the experience of her former struggles with Mr. Caswall and of the condition in which these left her , would have taken steps -- even peremptory ones , if necessary -- to prevent a repetition . Edgar arrived punctually to the time appointed by herself . When Lilla , through the great window , saw him approaching the house , her condition of nervous upset was pitiable . She braced herself up , however , and managed to get through the interview in its preliminary stages without any perceptible change in her normal appearance and bearing . It had been to her an added terror that the black shadow of Oolanga , whom she dreaded , would follow hard on his master . A load was lifted from her mind when he did not make his usual stealthy approach . She had also feared , though in lesser degree , lest Lady Arabella should be present to make trouble for her as before . With a woman 's natural forethought in a difficult position , she had provided the furnishing of the tea-table as a subtle indication of the social difference between her and her guest . She had chosen the implements of service , as well as all the provender set forth , of the humblest kind . Instead of arranging the silver teapot and china cups , she had set out an earthen teapot , such as was in common use in the farm kitchen . The same idea was carried out in the cups and saucers of thick homely delft , and in the cream-jug of similar kind . The bread was of simple whole-meal , home-baked . The butter was good , since she had made it herself , while the preserves and honey came from her own garden . Her face beamed with satisfaction when the guest eyed the appointments with a supercilious glance . It was a shock to the poor girl herself , for she enjoyed offering to a guest the little hospitalities possible to her ; but that had to be sacrificed with other pleasures . Caswall 's face was more set and iron-clad than ever -- his piercing eyes seemed from the very beginning to look her through and through . Her heart quailed when she thought of what would follow -- of what would be the end , when this was only the beginning . As some protection , though it could be only of a sentimental kind , she brought from her own room the photographs of Mimi , of her grandfather , and of Adam Salton , whom by now she had grown to look on with reliance , as a brother whom she could trust . She kept the pictures near her heart , to which her hand naturally strayed when her feelings of constraint , distrust , or fear became so poignant as to interfere with the calm which she felt was necessary to help her through her ordeal . At first Edgar Caswall was courteous and polite , even thoughtful ; but after a little while , when he found her resistance to his domination grow , he abandoned all forms of self-control and appeared in the same dominance as he had previously shown . She was prepared , however , for this , both by her former experience and the natural fighting instinct within her . By this means , as the minutes went on , both developed the power and preserved the equality in which they had begun . Without warning , the psychic battle between the two individualities began afresh . This time both the positive and negative causes were all in favour of the man . The woman was alone and in bad spirits , unsupported ; nothing at all was in her favour except the memory of the two victorious contests ; whereas the man , though unaided , as before , by either Lady Arabella or Oolanga , was in full strength , well rested , and in flourishing circumstances . It was not , therefore , to be wondered at that his native dominance of character had full opportunity of asserting itself . He began his preliminary stare with a conscious sense of power , and , as it appeared to have immediate effect on the girl , he felt an ever- growing conviction of ultimate victory . After a little Lilla 's resolution began to flag . She felt that the contest was unequal -- that she was unable to put forth her best efforts . As she was an unselfish person , she could not fight so well in her own battle as in that of someone whom she loved and to whom she was devoted . Edgar saw the relaxing of the muscles of face and brow , and the almost collapse of the heavy eyelids which seemed tumbling downward in sleep . Lilla made gallant efforts to brace her dwindling powers , but for a time unsuccessfully . At length there came an interruption , which seemed like a powerful stimulant . Through the wide window she saw Lady Arabella enter the plain gateway of the farm , and advance towards the hall door . She was clad as usual in tight-fitting white , which accentuated her thin , sinuous figure . The sight did for Lilla what no voluntary effort could have done . Her eyes flashed , and in an instant she felt as though a new life had suddenly developed within her . Lady Arabella 's entry , in her usual unconcerned , haughty , supercilious way , heightened the effect , so that when the two stood close to each other battle was joined . Mr. Caswall , too , took new courage from her coming , and all his masterfulness and power came back to him . His looks , intensified , had more obvious effect than had been noticeable that day . Lilla seemed at last overcome by his dominance . Her face became red and pale -- violently red and ghastly pale -- by rapid turns . Her strength seemed gone . Her knees collapsed , and she was actually sinking on the floor , when to her surprise and joy Mimi came into the room , running hurriedly and breathing heavily . Lilla rushed to her , and the two clasped hands . With that , a new sense of power , greater than Lilla had ever seen in her , seemed to quicken her cousin . Her hand swept the air in front of Edgar Caswall , seeming to drive him backward more and more by each movement , till at last he seemed to be actually hurled through the door which Mimi 's entrance had left open , and fell at full length on the gravel path without . Then came the final and complete collapse of Lilla , who , without a sound , sank down on the floor . CHAPTER XXVI -- FACE TO FACE Mimi was greatly distressed when she saw her cousin lying prone . She had a few times in her life seen Lilla on the verge of fainting , but never senseless ; and now she was frightened . She threw herself on her knees beside Lilla , and tried , by rubbing her hands and other measures commonly known , to restore her . But all her efforts were unavailing . Lilla still lay white and senseless . In fact , each moment she looked worse ; her breast , that had been heaving with the stress , became still , and the pallor of her face grew like marble . At these succeeding changes Mimi 's fright grew , till it altogether mastered her . She succeeded in controlling herself only to the extent that she did not scream . Lady Arabella had followed Caswall , when he had recovered sufficiently to get up and walk -- though stumblingly -- in the direction of Castra Regis . When Mimi was quite alone with Lilla and the need for effort had ceased , she felt weak and trembled . In her own mind , she attributed it to a sudden change in the weather -- it was momentarily becoming apparent that a storm was coming on . She raised Lilla 's head and laid it on her warm young breast , but all in vain . The cold of the white features thrilled through her , and she utterly collapsed when it was borne in on her that Lilla had passed away . The dusk gradually deepened and the shades of evening closed in , but Mimi did not seem to notice or to care . She sat on the floor with her arms round the body of the girl whom she loved . Darker and blacker grew the sky as the coming storm and the closing night joined forces . Still she sat on -- alone -- tearless -- unable to think . Mimi did not know how long she sat there . Though it seemed to her that ages had passed , it could not have been more than half-an-hour . She suddenly came to herself , and was surprised to find that her grandfather had not returned . For a while she lay quiet , thinking of the immediate past . Lilla 's hand was still in hers , and to her surprise it was still warm . Somehow this helped her consciousness , and without any special act of will she stood up . She lit a lamp and looked at her cousin . There was no doubt that Lilla was dead ; but when the lamp-light fell on her eyes , they seemed to look at Mimi with intent -- with meaning . In this state of dark isolation a new resolution came to her , and grew and grew until it became a fixed definite purpose . She would face Caswall and call him to account for his murder of Lilla -- that was what she called it to herself . She would also take steps -- she knew not what or how -- to avenge the part taken by Lady Arabella . In this frame of mind she lit all the lamps in the room , got water and linen from her room , and set about the decent ordering of Lilla 's body . This took some time ; but when it was finished , she put on her hat and cloak , put out the lights , and set out quietly for Castra Regis . As Mimi drew near the Castle , she saw no lights except those in and around the tower room . The lights showed her that Mr. Caswall was there , so she entered by the hall door , which as usual was open , and felt her way in the darkness up the staircase to the lobby of the room . The door was ajar , and the light from within showed brilliantly through the opening . She saw Edgar Caswall walking restlessly to and fro in the room , with his hands clasped behind his back . She opened the door without knocking , and walked right into the room . As she entered , he ceased walking , and stared at her in surprise . She made no remark , no comment , but continued the fixed look which he had seen on her entrance . For a time silence reigned , and the two stood looking fixedly at each other . Mimi was the first to speak . `` You murderer ! Lilla is dead ! '' `` Dead ! Good God ! When did she die ? '' `` She died this afternoon , just after you left her . '' `` Are you sure ? '' `` Yes -- and so are you -- or you ought to be . You killed her ! '' `` I killed her ! Be careful what you say ! '' `` As God sees us , it is true ; and you know it . You came to Mercy Farm on purpose to break her -- if you could . And the accomplice of your guilt , Lady Arabella March , came for the same purpose . '' `` Be careful , woman , '' he said hotly . `` Do not use such names in that way , or you shall suffer for it . '' `` I am suffering for it -- have suffered for it -- shall suffer for it . Not for speaking the truth as I have done , but because you two , with devilish malignity , did my darling to death . It is you and your accomplice who have to dread punishment , not I . '' `` Take care ! '' he said again . `` Oh , I am not afraid of you or your accomplice , '' she answered spiritedly . `` I am content to stand by every word I have said , every act I have done . Moreover , I believe in God 's justice . I fear not the grinding of His mills ; if necessary I shall set the wheels in motion myself . But you do n't care for God , or believe in Him . Your god is your great kite , which cows the birds of a whole district . But be sure that His hand , when it rises , always falls at the appointed time . It may be that your name is being called even at this very moment at the Great Assize . Repent while there is still time . Happy you , if you may be allowed to enter those mighty halls in the company of the pure-souled angel whose voice has only to whisper one word of justice , and you disappear for ever into everlasting torment . '' The sudden death of Lilla caused consternation among Mimi 's friends and well-wishers . Such a tragedy was totally unexpected , as Adam and Sir Nathaniel had been expecting the White Worm 's vengeance to fall upon themselves . Adam , leaving his wife free to follow her own desires with regard to Lilla and her grandfather , busied himself with filling the well-hole with the fine sand prepared for the purpose , taking care to have lowered at stated intervals quantities of the store of dynamite , so as to be ready for the final explosion . He had under his immediate supervision a corps of workmen , and was assisted by Sir Nathaniel , who had come over for the purpose , and all were now staying at Lesser Hill . Mr. Salton , too , showed much interest in the job , and was constantly coming in and out , nothing escaping his observation . Since her marriage to Adam and their coming to stay at Doom Tower , Mimi had been fettered by fear of the horrible monster at Diana 's Grove . But now she dreaded it no longer . She accepted the fact of its assuming at will the form of Lady Arabella . She had still to tax and upbraid her for her part in the unhappiness which had been wrought on Lilla , and for her share in causing her death . One evening , when Mimi entered her own room , she went to the window and threw an eager look round the whole circle of sight . A single glance satisfied her that the White Worm in _propria persona_ was not visible . So she sat down in the window-seat and enjoyed the pleasure of a full view , from which she had been so long cut off . The maid who waited on her had told her that Mr. Salton had not yet returned home , so she felt free to enjoy the luxury of peace and quiet . As she looked out of the window , she saw something thin and white move along the avenue . She thought she recognised the figure of Lady Arabella , and instinctively drew back behind the curtain . When she had ascertained , by peeping out several times , that the lady had not seen her , she watched more carefully , all her instinctive hatred flooding back at the sight of her . Lady Arabella was moving swiftly and stealthily , looking back and around her at intervals , as if she feared to be followed . This gave Mimi an idea that she was up to no good , so she determined to seize the occasion for watching her in more detail . Hastily putting on a dark cloak and hat , she ran downstairs and out into the avenue . Lady Arabella had moved , but the sheen of her white dress was still to be seen among the young oaks around the gateway . Keeping in shadow , Mimi followed , taking care not to come so close as to awake the other 's suspicion , and watched her quarry pass along the road in the direction of Castra Regis . She followed on steadily through the gloom of the trees , depending on the glint of the white dress to keep her right . The wood began to thicken , and presently , when the road widened and the trees grew farther back , she lost sight of any indication of her whereabouts . Under the present conditions it was impossible for her to do any more , so , after waiting for a while , still hidden in the shadow to see if she could catch another glimpse of the white frock , she determined to go on slowly towards Castra Regis , and trust to the chapter of accidents to pick up the trail again . She went on slowly , taking advantage of every obstacle and shadow to keep herself concealed . At last she entered on the grounds of the Castle , at a spot from which the windows of the turret were dimly visible , without having seen again any sign of Lady Arabella . Meanwhile , during most of the time that Mimi Salton had been moving warily along in the gloom , she was in reality being followed by Lady Arabella , who had caught sight of her leaving the house and had never again lost touch with her . It was a case of the hunter being hunted . For a time Mimi 's many turnings , with the natural obstacles that were perpetually intervening , caused Lady Arabella some trouble ; but when she was close to Castra Regis , there was no more possibility of concealment , and the strange double following went swiftly on . When she saw Mimi close to the hall door of Castra Regis and ascending the steps , she followed . When Mimi entered the dark hall and felt her way up the staircase , still , as she believed , following Lady Arabella , the latter kept on her way . When they reached the lobby of the turret- rooms , Mimi believed that the object of her search was ahead of her . Edgar Caswall sat in the gloom of the great room , occasionally stirred to curiosity when the drifting clouds allowed a little light to fall from the storm-swept sky . But nothing really interested him now . Since he had heard of Lilla 's death , the gloom of his remorse , emphasised by Mimi 's upbraiding , had made more hopeless his cruel , selfish , saturnine nature . He heard no sound , for his normal faculties seemed benumbed . Mimi , when she came to the door , which stood ajar , gave a light tap . So light was it that it did not reach Caswall 's ears . Then , taking her courage in both hands , she boldly pushed the door and entered . As she did so , her heart sank , for now she was face to face with a difficulty which had not , in her state of mental perturbation , occurred to her . CHAPTER XXVII -- ON THE TURRET ROOF The storm which was coming was already making itself manifest , not only in the wide scope of nature , but in the hearts and natures of human beings . Electrical disturbance in the sky and the air is reproduced in animals of all kinds , and particularly in the highest type of them all -- the most receptive -- the most electrical . So it was with Edgar Caswall , despite his selfish nature and coldness of blood . So it was with Mimi Salton , despite her unselfish , unchanging devotion for those she loved . So it was even with Lady Arabella , who , under the instincts of a primeval serpent , carried the ever-varying wishes and customs of womanhood , which is always old -- and always new . Edgar , after he had turned his eyes on Mimi , resumed his apathetic position and sullen silence . Mimi quietly took a seat a little way apart , whence she could look on the progress of the coming storm and study its appearance throughout the whole visible circle of the neighbourhood . She was in brighter and better spirits than she had been for many days past . Lady Arabella tried to efface herself behind the now open door . Without , the clouds grew thicker and blacker as the storm-centre came closer . As yet the forces , from whose linking the lightning springs , were held apart , and the silence of nature proclaimed the calm before the storm . Caswall felt the effect of the gathering electric force . A sort of wild exultation grew upon him , such as he had sometimes felt just before the breaking of a tropical storm . As he became conscious of this , he raised his head and caught sight of Mimi . He was in the grip of an emotion greater than himself ; in the mood in which he was he felt the need upon him of doing some desperate deed . He was now absolutely reckless , and as Mimi was associated with him in the memory which drove him on , he wished that she too should be engaged in this enterprise . He had no knowledge of the proximity of Lady Arabella , and thought that he was far removed from all he knew and whose interests he shared -- alone with the wild elements , which were being lashed to fury , and with the woman who had struggled with him and vanquished him , and on whom he would shower the full measure of his hate . The fact was that Edgar Caswall was , if not mad , close to the border-line . Madness in its first stage -- monomania -- is a lack of proportion . So long as this is general , it is not always noticeable , for the uninspired onlooker is without the necessary means of comparison . But in monomania the errant faculty protrudes itself in a way that may not be denied . It puts aside , obscures , or takes the place of something else -- just as the head of a pin placed before the centre of the iris will block out the whole scope of vision . The most usual form of monomania has commonly the same beginning as that from which Edgar Caswall suffered -- an over-large idea of self-importance . Alienists , who study the matter exactly , probably know more of human vanity and its effects than do ordinary men . Caswall 's mental disturbance was not hard to identify . Every asylum is full of such cases -- men and women , who , naturally selfish and egotistical , so appraise to themselves their own importance that every other circumstance in life becomes subservient to it . The disease supplies in itself the material for self-magnification . When the decadence attacks a nature naturally proud and selfish and vain , and lacking both the aptitude and habit of self-restraint , the development of the disease is more swift , and ranges to farther limits . It is such persons who become imbued with the idea that they have the attributes of the Almighty -- even that they themselves are the Almighty . Mimi had a suspicion -- or rather , perhaps , an intuition -- of the true state of things when she heard him speak , and at the same time noticed the abnormal flush on his face , and his rolling eyes . There was a certain want of fixedness of purpose which she had certainly not noticed before -- a quick , spasmodic utterance which belongs rather to the insane than to those of intellectual equilibrium . She was a little frightened , not only by his thoughts , but by his staccato way of expressing them . Caswall moved to the door leading to the turret stair by which the roof was reached , and spoke in a peremptory way , whose tone alone made her feel defiant . `` Come ! I want you . '' She instinctively drew back -- she was not accustomed to such words , more especially to such a tone . Her answer was indicative of a new contest . `` Why should I go ? What for ? '' He did not at once reply -- another indication of his overwhelming egotism . She repeated her questions ; habit reasserted itself , and he spoke without thinking the words which were in his heart . `` I want you , if you will be so good , to come with me to the turret roof . I am much interested in certain experiments with the kite , which would be , if not a pleasure , at least a novel experience to you . You would see something not easily seen otherwise . '' `` I will come , '' she answered simply ; Edgar moved in the direction of the stair , she following close behind him . She did not like to be left alone at such a height , in such a place , in the darkness , with a storm about to break . Of himself she had no fear ; all that had been seemed to have passed away with her two victories over him in the struggle of wills . Moreover , the more recent apprehension -- that of his madness -- had also ceased . In the conversation of the last few minutes he seemed so rational , so clear , so unaggressive , that she no longer saw reason for doubt . So satisfied was she that even when he put out a hand to guide her to the steep , narrow stairway , she took it without thought in the most conventional way . Lady Arabella , crouching in the lobby behind the door , heard every word that had been said , and formed her own opinion of it . It seemed evident to her that there had been some rapprochement between the two who had so lately been hostile to each other , and that made her furiously angry . Mimi was interfering with her plans ! She had made certain of her capture of Edgar Caswall , and she could not tolerate even the lightest and most contemptuous fancy on his part which might divert him from the main issue . When she became aware that he wished Mimi to come with him to the roof and that she had acquiesced , her rage got beyond bounds . She became oblivious to any danger there might be in a visit to such an exposed place at such a time , and to all lesser considerations , and made up her mind to forestall them . She stealthily and noiselessly crept through the wicket , and , ascending the stair , stepped out on the roof . It was bitterly cold , for the fierce gusts of the storm which swept round the turret drove in through every unimpeded way , whistling at the sharp corners and singing round the trembling flagstaff . The kite-string and the wire which controlled the runners made a concourse of weird sounds which somehow , perhaps from the violence which surrounded them , acting on their length , resolved themselves into some kind of harmony -- a fitting accompaniment to the tragedy which seemed about to begin . Mimi 's heart beat heavily . Just before leaving the turret-chamber she had a shock which she could not shake off . The lights of the room had momentarily revealed to her , as they passed out , Edgar 's face , concentrated as it was whenever he intended to use his mesmeric power . Now the black eyebrows made a thick line across his face , under which his eyes shone and glittered ominously . Mimi recognised the danger , and assumed the defiant attitude that had twice already served her so well . She had a fear that the circumstances and the place were against her , and she wanted to be forearmed . The sky was now somewhat lighter than it had been . Either there was lightning afar off , whose reflections were carried by the rolling clouds , or else the gathered force , though not yet breaking into lightning , had an incipient power of light . It seemed to affect both the man and the woman . Edgar seemed altogether under its influence . His spirits were boisterous , his mind exalted . He was now at his worst ; madder than he had been earlier in the night . Mimi , trying to keep as far from him as possible , moved across the stone floor of the turret roof , and found a niche which concealed her . It was not far from Lady Arabella 's place of hiding . Edgar , left thus alone on the centre of the turret roof , found himself altogether his own master in a way which tended to increase his madness . He knew that Mimi was close at hand , though he had lost sight of her . He spoke loudly , and the sound of his own voice , though it was carried from him on the sweeping wind as fast as the words were spoken , seemed to exalt him still more . Even the raging of the elements round him appeared to add to his exaltation . To him it seemed that these manifestations were obedient to his own will . He had reached the sublime of his madness ; he was now in his own mind actually the Almighty , and whatever might happen would be the direct carrying out of his own commands . As he could not see Mimi , nor fix whereabout she was , he shouted loudly : '' Come to me ! You shall see now what you are despising , what you are warring against . All that you see is mine -- the darkness as well as the light . I tell you that I am greater than any other who is , or was , or shall be . When the Master of Evil took Christ up on a high place and showed Him all the kingdoms of the earth , he was doing what he thought no other could do . He was wrong -- he forgot _Me_ . I shall send you light , up to the very ramparts of heaven . A light so great that it shall dissipate those black clouds that are rushing up and piling around us . Look ! Look ! At the very touch of my hand that light springs into being and mounts up -- and up -- and up ! '' He made his way whilst he was speaking to the corner of the turret whence flew the giant kite , and from which the runners ascended . Mimi looked on , appalled and afraid to speak lest she should precipitate some calamity . Within the niche Lady Arabella cowered in a paroxysm of fear . Edgar took up a small wooden box , through a hole in which the wire of the runner ran . This evidently set some machinery in motion , for a sound as of whirring came . From one side of the box floated what looked like a piece of stiff ribbon , which snapped and crackled as the wind took it . For a few seconds Mimi saw it as it rushed along the sagging line to the kite . When close to it , there was a loud crack , and a sudden light appeared to issue from every chink in the box . Then a quick flame flashed along the snapping ribbon , which glowed with an intense light -- a light so great that the whole of the countryside around stood out against the background of black driving clouds . For a few seconds the light remained , then suddenly disappeared in the blackness around . Transcribed form the 1911 W. Foulsham & Co.

CHAPTER I -- ADAM SALTON ARRIVES Adam Salton sauntered into the Empire Club , Sydney , and found awaiting him a letter from his grand-uncle . He had first heard from the old gentleman less than a year before , when Richard Salton had claimed kinship , stating that he had been unable to write earlier , as he had found it very difficult to trace his grand-nephew 's address . Adam was delighted and replied cordially ; he had often heard his father speak of the older branch of the family with whom his people had long lost touch . Some interesting correspondence had ensued . Adam eagerly opened the letter which had only just arrived , and conveyed a cordial invitation to stop with his grand-uncle at Lesser Hill , for as long a time as he could spare . `` Indeed , '' Richard Salton went on , `` I am in hopes that you will make your permanent home here . You see , my dear boy , you and I are all that remain of our race , and it is but fitting that you should succeed me when the time comes . In this year of grace , 1860 , I am close on eighty years of age , and though we have been a long-lived race , the span of life can not be prolonged beyond reasonable bounds . I am prepared to like you , and to make your home with me as happy as you could wish . So do come at once on receipt of this , and find the welcome I am waiting to give you . I send , in case such may make matters easy for you , a banker 's draft for 200 pounds . Come soon , so that we may both of us enjoy many happy days together . If you are able to give me the pleasure of seeing you , send me as soon as you can a letter telling me when to expect you . Then when you arrive at Plymouth or Southampton or whatever port you are bound for , wait on board , and I will meet you at the earliest hour possible . '' * * * * * Old Mr. Salton was delighted when Adam 's reply arrived and sent a groom hot-foot to his crony , Sir Nathaniel de Salis , to inform him that his grand-nephew was due at Southampton on the twelfth of June . Mr. Salton gave instructions to have ready a carriage early on the important day , to start for Stafford , where he would catch the 11.40 a.m. train . He would stay that night with his grand-nephew , either on the ship , which would be a new experience for him , or , if his guest should prefer it , at a hotel . In either case they would start in the early morning for home . He had given instructions to his bailiff to send the postillion carriage on to Southampton , to be ready for their journey home , and to arrange for relays of his own horses to be sent on at once . He intended that his grand-nephew , who had been all his life in Australia , should see something of rural England on the drive . He had plenty of young horses of his own breeding and breaking , and could depend on a journey memorable to the young man . The luggage would be sent on by rail to Stafford , where one of his carts would meet it . Mr. Salton , during the journey to Southampton , often wondered if his grand-nephew was as much excited as he was at the idea of meeting so near a relation for the first time ; and it was with an effort that he controlled himself . The endless railway lines and switches round the Southampton Docks fired his anxiety afresh . As the train drew up on the dockside , he was getting his hand traps together , when the carriage door was wrenched open and a young man jumped in . `` How are you , uncle ? I recognised you from the photo you sent me ! I wanted to meet you as soon as I could , but everything is so strange to me that I did n't quite know what to do . However , here I am . I am glad to see you , sir . I have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of miles ; now I find that the reality beats all the dreaming ! '' As he spoke the old man and the young one were heartily wringing each other 's hands . The meeting so auspiciously begun proceeded well . Adam , seeing that the old man was interested in the novelty of the ship , suggested that he should stay the night on board , and that he would himself be ready to start at any hour and go anywhere that the other suggested . This affectionate willingness to fall in with his own plans quite won the old man 's heart . He warmly accepted the invitation , and at once they became not only on terms of affectionate relationship , but almost like old friends . The heart of the old man , which had been empty for so long , found a new delight . The young man found , on landing in the old country , a welcome and a surrounding in full harmony with all his dreams throughout his wanderings and solitude , and the promise of a fresh and adventurous life . It was not long before the old man accepted him to full relationship by calling him by his Christian name . After a long talk on affairs of interest , they retired to the cabin , which the elder was to share . Richard Salton put his hands affectionately on the boy's shoulders -- though Adam was in his twenty-seventh year , he was a boy , and always would be , to his grand-uncle . `` I am so glad to find you as you are , my dear boy -- just such a young man as I had always hoped for as a son , in the days when I still had such hopes . However , that is all past . But thank God there is a new life to begin for both of us . To you must be the larger part -- but there is still time for some of it to be shared in common . I have waited till we should have seen each other to enter upon the subject ; for I thought it better not to tie up your young life to my old one till we should have sufficient personal knowledge to justify such a venture . Now I can , so far as I am concerned , enter into it freely , since from the moment my eyes rested on you I saw my son -- as he shall be , God willing -- if he chooses such a course himself . '' `` Indeed I do , sir -- with all my heart ! '' `` Thank you , Adam , for that . '' The old , man 's eyes filled and his voice trembled . Then , after a long silence between them , he went on : `` When I heard you were coming I made my will . It was well that your interests should be protected from that moment on . Here is the deed -- keep it , Adam . All I have shall belong to you ; and if love and good wishes , or the memory of them , can make life sweeter , yours shall be a happy one . Now , my dear boy , let us turn in . We start early in the morning and have a long drive before us . I hope you do n't mind driving ? I was going to have the old travelling carriage in which my grandfather , your great-grand-uncle , went to Court when William IV . was king . It is all right -- they built well in those days -- and it has been kept in perfect order . But I think I have done better : I have sent the carriage in which I travel myself . The horses are of my own breeding , and relays of them shall take us all the way . I hope you like horses ? They have long been one of my greatest interests in life . '' `` I love them , sir , and I am happy to say I have many of my own . My father gave me a horse farm for myself when I was eighteen . I devoted myself to it , and it has gone on . Before I came away , my steward gave me a memorandum that we have in my own place more than a thousand , nearly all good . '' `` I am glad , my boy . Another link between us . '' `` Just fancy what a delight it will be , sir , to see so much of England -- and with you ! '' `` Thank you again , my boy . I will tell you all about your future home and its surroundings as we go . We shall travel in old-fashioned state , I tell you . My grandfather always drove four-in-hand ; and so shall we . '' `` Oh , thanks , sir , thanks . May I take the ribbons sometimes ? '' `` Whenever you choose , Adam . The team is your own . Every horse we use to- day is to be your own . '' `` You are too generous , uncle ! '' `` Not at all . Only an old man 's selfish pleasure . It is not every day that an heir to the old home comes back . And -- oh , by the way . . . No , we had better turn in now -- I shall tell you the rest in the morning . '' CHAPTER II -- THE CASWALLS OF CASTRA REGIS Mr. Salton had all his life been an early riser , and necessarily an early waker . But early as he woke on the next morning -- and although there was an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr and rattle of the `` donkey '' engine winches of the great ship -- he met the eyes of Adam fixed on him from his berth . His grand-nephew had given him the sofa , occupying the lower berth himself . The old man , despite his great strength and normal activity , was somewhat tired by his long journey of the day before , and the prolonged and exciting interview which followed it . So he was glad to lie still and rest his body , whilst his mind was actively exercised in taking in all he could of his strange surroundings . Adam , too , after the pastoral habit to which he had been bred , woke with the dawn , and was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day whenever it might suit his elder companion . It was little wonder , then , that , so soon as each realised the other 's readiness , they simultaneously jumped up and began to dress . The steward had by previous instructions early breakfast prepared , and it was not long before they went down the gangway on shore in search of the carriage . They found Mr. Salton 's bailiff looking out for them on the dock , and he brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the street . Richard Salton pointed out with pride to his young companion the suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel . To it were harnessed four useful horses , with a postillion to each pair . `` See , '' said the old man proudly , `` how it has all the luxuries of useful travel -- silence and isolation as well as speed . There is nothing to obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to overhear what they may say . I have used that trap for a quarter of a century , and I never saw one more suitable for travel . You shall test it shortly . We are going to drive through the heart of England ; and as we go I 'll tell you what I was speaking of last night . Our route is to be by Salisbury , Bath , Bristol , Cheltenham , Worcester , Stafford ; and so home . '' Adam remained silent a few minutes , during which he seemed all eyes , for he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon . `` Has our journey to-day , sir , '' he asked , `` any special relation to what you said last night that you wanted to tell me ? '' `` Not directly ; but indirectly , everything . '' `` Wo n't you tell me now -- I see we can not be overheard -- and if anything strikes you as we go along , just run it in . I shall understand . '' So old Salton spoke : '' To begin at the beginning , Adam . That lecture of yours on 'The Romans in Britain , ' a report of which you posted to me , set me thinking -- in addition to telling me your tastes . I wrote to you at once and asked you to come home , for it struck me that if you were fond of historical research -- as seemed a fact -- this was exactly the place for you , in addition to its being the home of your own forbears . If you could learn so much of the British Romans so far away in New South Wales , where there can not be even a tradition of them , what might you not make of the same amount of study on the very spot . Where we are going is in the real heart of the old kingdom of Mercia , where there are traces of all the various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became Britain . '' `` I rather gathered that you had some more definite -- more personal reason for my hurrying . After all , history can keep -- except in the making ! '' `` Quite right , my boy . I had a reason such as you very wisely guessed . I was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local history occurred . '' `` What is that , if I may ask , sir ? '' `` Certainly . The principal landowner of our part of the county is on his way home , and there will be a great home-coming , which you may care to see . The fact is , for more than a century the various owners in the succession here , with the exception of a short time , have lived abroad . '' `` How is that , sir , if I may ask ? '' `` The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra Regis , the family seat of the Caswall family . The last owner who lived here was Edgar Caswall , grandfather of the man who is coming here -- and he was the only one who stayed even a short time . This man 's grandfather , also named Edgar -- they keep the tradition of the family Christian name -- quarrelled with his family and went to live abroad , not keeping up any intercourse , good or bad , with his relatives , although this particular Edgar , as I told you , did visit his family estate , yet his son was born and lived and died abroad , while his grandson , the latest inheritor , was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirty -- his present age . This was the second line of absentees . The great estate of Castra Regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five generations -- covering more than a hundred and twenty years . It has been well administered , however , and no tenant or other connected with it has had anything of which to complain . All the same , there has been much natural anxiety to see the new owner , and we are all excited about the event of his coming . Even I am , though I own my own estate , which , though adjacent , is quite apart from Castra Regis. -- Here we are now in new ground for you . That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral , and when we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county , and you will naturally want your eyes . So we shall shortly have to keep our minds on old Mercia . However , you need not be disappointed . My old friend , Sir Nathaniel de Salis , who , like myself , is a free-holder near Castra Regis -- his estate , Doom Tower , is over the border of Derbyshire , on the Peak -- is coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome Edgar Caswall . He is just the sort of man you will like . He is devoted to history , and is President of the Mercian Archaeological Society . He knows more of our own part of the country , with its history and its people , than anyone else . I expect he will have arrived before us , and we three can have a long chat after dinner . He is also our local geologist and natural historian . So you and he will have many interests in common . Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak and its caverns , and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times . '' They spent the night at Cheltenham , and on the following morning resumed their journey to Stafford . Adam 's eyes were in constant employment , and it was not till Salton declared that they had now entered on the last stage of their journey , that he referred to Sir Nathaniel 's coming . As the dusk was closing down , they drove on to Lesser Hill , Mr. Salton's house . It was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings . Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill , not quite so high as that which was covered by the Castle , on whose tower flew the flag , and which was all ablaze with moving lights , manifestly used in the preparations for the festivities on the morrow . So Adam deferred his curiosity till daylight . His grand-uncle was met at the door by a fine old man , who greeted him warmly . `` I came over early as you wished . I suppose this is your grand-nephew -- I am glad to meet you , Mr. Adam Salton . I am Nathaniel de Salis , and your uncle is one of my oldest friends . '' Adam , from the moment of their eyes meeting , felt as if they were already friends . The meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already sounded in his ears . The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met , made the imparting of information easy . Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of the world , who had travelled much , and within a certain area studied deeply . He was a brilliant conversationalist , as was to be expected from a successful diplomatist , even under unstimulating conditions . But he had been touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger man 's evident admiration and willingness to learn from him . Accordingly the conversation , which began on the most friendly basis , soon warmed to an interest above proof , as the old man spoke of it next day to Richard Salton . He knew already that his old friend wanted his grand-nephew to learn all he could of the subject in hand , and so had during his journey from the Peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation . Accordingly , Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he wanted to know . When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn , leaving the three men at their wine , Sir Nathaniel began . `` I gather from your uncle -- by the way , I suppose we had better speak of you as uncle and nephew , instead of going into exact relationship ? In fact , your uncle is so old and dear a friend , that , with your permission , I shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as Adam , as though you were his son . '' `` I should like , '' answered the young man , `` nothing better ! '' The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men , but , with the usual avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves , they instinctively returned to the previous question . Sir Nathaniel took the lead . `` I understand , Adam , that your uncle has posted you regarding the relationships of the Caswall family ? '' `` Partly , sir ; but I understood that I was to hear minuter details from you -- if you would be so good . '' `` I shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge goes . Well , the first Caswall in our immediate record is an Edgar , head of the family and owner of the estate , who came into his kingdom just about the time that George III . did . He had one son of about twenty-four . There was a violent quarrel between the two . No one of this generation has any idea of the cause ; but , considering the family characteristics , we may take it for granted that though it was deep and violent , it was on the surface trivial . `` The result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was going . He never came back again . A few years after , he died , without having in the meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his father . He married abroad and left one son , who seems to have been brought up in ignorance of all belonging to him . The gulf between them appears to have been unbridgable ; for in time this son married and in turn had a son , but neither joy nor sorrow brought the sundered together . Under such conditions no _rapprochement_ was to be looked for , and an utter indifference , founded at best on ignorance , took the place of family affection -- even on community of interests . It was only due to the watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of this new heir was ever made known . He actually spent a few months in the ancestral home . `` After this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the estate . As no other children have been born to any of the newer generations in the intervening years , all hopes of heritage are now centred in the grandson of this man . `` Now , it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing characteristics of this race . These were well preserved and unchanging ; one and all they are the same : cold , selfish , dominant , reckless of consequences in pursuit of their own will . It was not that they did not keep faith , though that was a matter which gave them little concern , but that they took care to think beforehand of what they should do in order to gain their own ends . If they should make a mistake , someone else should bear the burthen of it . This was so perpetually recurrent that it seemed to be a part of a fixed policy . It was no wonder that , whatever changes took place , they were always ensured in their own possessions . They were absolutely cold and hard by nature . Not one of them -- so far as we have any knowledge -- was ever known to be touched by the softer sentiments , to swerve from his purpose , or hold his hand in obedience to the dictates of his heart . The pictures and effigies of them all show their adherence to the early Roman type . Their eyes were full ; their hair , of raven blackness , grew thick and close and curly . Their figures were massive and typical of strength . `` The thick black hair , growing low down on the neck , told of vast physical strength and endurance . But the most remarkable characteristic is the eyes . Black , piercing , almost unendurable , they seem to contain in themselves a remarkable will power which there is no gainsaying . It is a power that is partly racial and partly individual : a power impregnated with some mysterious quality , partly hypnotic , partly mesmeric , which seems to take away from eyes that meet them all power of resistance -- nay , all power of wishing to resist . With eyes like those , set in that all-commanding face , one would need to be strong indeed to think of resisting the inflexible will that lay behind . `` You may think , Adam , that all this is imagination on my part , especially as I have never seen any of them . So it is , but imagination based on deep study . I have made use of all I know or can surmise logically regarding this strange race . With such strange compelling qualities , is it any wonder that there is abroad an idea that in the race there is some demoniac possession , which tends to a more definite belief that certain individuals have in the past sold themselves to the Devil ? `` But I think we had better go to bed now . We have a lot to get through to-morrow , and I want you to have your brain clear , and all your susceptibilities fresh . Moreover , I want you to come with me for an early walk , during which we may notice , whilst the matter is fresh in our minds , the peculiar disposition of this place -- not merely your grand-uncle 's estate , but the lie of the country around it . There are many things on which we may seek -- and perhaps find -- enlightenment . The more we know at the start , the more things which may come into our view will develop themselves . '' CHAPTER III -- DIANA 'S GROVE Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning , but when he had dressed and gone downstairs ; he found that , early as he was , Sir Nathaniel was ahead of him . The old gentleman was quite prepared for a long walk , and they started at once . Sir Nathaniel , without speaking , led the way to the east , down the hill . When they had descended and risen again , they found themselves on the eastern brink of a steep hill . It was of lesser height than that on which the Castle was situated ; but it was so placed that it commanded the various hills that crowned the ridge . All along the ridge the rock cropped out , bare and bleak , but broken in rough natural castellation . The form of the ridge was a segment of a circle , with the higher points inland to the west . In the centre rose the Castle , on the highest point of all . Between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of various sizes and heights , amongst some of which were what , in the early morning light , looked like ruins . These -- whatever they were -- were of massive grey stone , probably limestone rudely cut -- if indeed they were not shaped naturally . The fall of the ground was steep all along the ridge , so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings seemed to overhang the plain far below , through which ran many",The Lair Of The White Worm
Pelham Grenville,"Produced by Tim Barnett THE ADVENTURES OF SALLY By P. G. Wodehouse CHAPTER I. SALLY GIVES A PARTY 1 Sally looked contentedly down the long table . She felt happy at last . Everybody was talking and laughing now , and her party , rallying after an uncertain start , was plainly the success she had hoped it would be . The first atmosphere of uncomfortable restraint , caused , she was only too well aware , by her brother Fillmore 's white evening waistcoat , had worn off ; and the male and female patrons of Mrs. Meecher 's select boarding-house ( transient and residential ) were themselves again . At her end of the table the conversation had turned once more to the great vital topic of Sally 's legacy and what she ought to do with it . The next best thing to having money of one 's own , is to dictate the spending of somebody else 's , and Sally 's guests were finding a good deal of satisfaction in arranging a Budget for her . Rumour having put the sum at their disposal at a high figure , their suggestions had certain spaciousness . “ Let me tell you , ” said Augustus Bartlett , briskly , “ what I 'd do , if I were you. ” Augustus Bartlett , who occupied an intensely subordinate position in the firm of Kahn , Morris and Brown , the Wall Street brokers , always affected a brisk , incisive style of speech , as befitted a man in close touch with the great ones of Finance . “ I 'd sink a couple of hundred thousand in some good , safe bond-issue -- we 've just put one out which you would do well to consider -- and play about with the rest . When I say play about , I mean have a flutter in anything good that crops up . Multiple Steel 's worth looking at . They tell me it 'll be up to a hundred and fifty before next Saturday. ” Elsa Doland , the pretty girl with the big eyes who sat on Mr. Bartlett's left , had other views . “ Buy a theatre , Sally , and put on good stuff. ” “ And lose every bean you 've got , ” said a mild young man , with a deep voice across the table . “ If I had a few hundred thousand , ” said the mild young man , “ I 'd put every cent of it on Benny Whistler for the heavyweight championship . I 've private information that Battling Tuke has been got at and means to lie down in the seventh ... ” “ Say , listen , ” interrupted another voice , “ lem me tell you what I 'd do with four hundred thousand ... ” “ If I had four hundred thousand , ” said Elsa Doland , “ I know what would be the first thing I 'd do. ” “ What 's that ? ” asked Sally . “ Pay my bill for last week , due this morning. ” Sally got up quickly , and flitting down the table , put her arm round her friend 's shoulder and whispered in her ear : “ Elsa darling , are you really broke ? If you are , you know , I 'll ... ” Elsa Doland laughed . “ You 're an angel , Sally . There 's no one like you . You 'd give your last cent to anyone . Of course I 'm not broke . I 've just come back from the road , and I 've saved a fortune . I only said that to draw you. ” Sally returned to her seat , relieved , and found that the company had now divided itself into two schools of thought . The conservative and prudent element , led by Augustus Bartlett , had definitely decided on three hundred thousand in Liberty Bonds and the rest in some safe real estate ; while the smaller , more sporting section , impressed by the mild young man 's inside information , had already placed Sally 's money on Benny Whistler , doling it out cautiously in small sums so as not to spoil the market . And so solid , it seemed , was Mr. Tuke 's reputation with those in the inner circle of knowledge that the mild young man was confident that , if you went about the matter cannily and without precipitation , three to one might be obtained . It seemed to Sally that the time had come to correct certain misapprehensions . “ I do n't know where you get your figures , ” she said , “ but I 'm afraid they 're wrong . I 've just twenty-five thousand dollars. ” The statement had a chilling effect . To these jugglers with half-millions the amount mentioned seemed for the moment almost too small to bother about . It was the sort of sum which they had been mentally setting aside for the heiress 's car fare . Then they managed to adjust their minds to it . After all , one could do something even with a pittance like twenty-five thousand . “ If I 'd twenty-five thousand , ” said Augustus Bartlett , the first to rally from the shock , “ I 'd buy Amalgamated ... ” “ If I had twenty-five thousand ... ” began Elsa Doland . “ If I 'd had twenty-five thousand in the year nineteen hundred , ” observed a gloomy-looking man with spectacles , “ I could have started a revolution in Paraguay. ” He brooded sombrely on what might have been . “ Well , I 'll tell you exactly what I 'm going to do , ” said Sally . “ I'm going to start with a trip to Europe ... France , specially . I 've heard France well spoken of -- as soon as I can get my passport ; and after I've loafed there for a few weeks , I 'm coming back to look about and find some nice cosy little business which will let me put money into it and keep me in luxury . Are there any complaints ? ” “ Even a couple of thousand on Benny Whistler ... ” said the mild young man . “ I do n't want your Benny Whistler , ” said Sally . “ I would n't have him if you gave him to me . If I want to lose money , I 'll go to Monte Carlo and do it properly. ” “ Monte Carlo , ” said the gloomy man , brightening up at the magic name . “ I was in Monte Carlo in the year '97 , and if I 'd had another fifty dollars ... just fifty ... I 'd have ... ” At the far end of the table there was a stir , a cough , and the grating of a chair on the floor ; and slowly , with that easy grace which actors of the old school learned in the days when acting was acting , Mr. Maxwell Faucitt , the boarding-house 's oldest inhabitant , rose to his feet . “ Ladies , ” said Mr. Faucitt , bowing courteously , “ and ... ” ceasing to bow and casting from beneath his white and venerable eyebrows a quelling glance at certain male members of the boarding-house 's younger set who were showing a disposition towards restiveness , “ ... gentlemen . I feel that I can not allow this occasion to pass without saying a few words. ” His audience did not seem surprised . It was possible that life , always prolific of incident in a great city like New York , might some day produce an occasion which Mr. Faucitt would feel that he could allow to pass without saying a few words ; but nothing of the sort had happened as yet , and they had given up hope . Right from the start of the meal they had felt that it would be optimism run mad to expect the old gentleman to abstain from speech on the night of Sally Nicholas ' farewell dinner party ; and partly because they had braced themselves to it , but principally because Miss Nicholas ' hospitality had left them with a genial feeling of repletion , they settled themselves to listen with something resembling equanimity . A movement on the part of the Marvellous Murphys -- new arrivals , who had been playing the Bushwick with their equilibristic act during the preceding week -- to form a party of the extreme left and heckle the speaker , broke down under a cold look from their hostess . Brief though their acquaintance had been , both of these lissom young gentlemen admired Sally immensely . And it should be set on record that this admiration of theirs was not misplaced . He would have been hard to please who had not been attracted by Sally . She was a small , trim , wisp of a girl with the tiniest hands and feet , the friendliest of smiles , and a dimple that came and went in the curve of her rounded chin . Her eyes , which disappeared when she laughed , which was often , were a bright hazel ; her hair a soft mass of brown . She had , moreover , a manner , an air of distinction lacking in the majority of Mrs. Meecher 's guests . And she carried youth like a banner . In approving of Sally , the Marvellous Murphys had been guilty of no lapse from their high critical standard . “ I have been asked , ” proceeded Mr. Faucitt , “ though I am aware that there are others here far worthier of such a task -- Brutuses compared with whom I , like Marc Antony , am no orator -- I have been asked to propose the health ... ” “ Who asked you ? ” It was the smaller of the Marvellous Murphys who spoke . He was an unpleasant youth , snub-nosed and spotty . Still , he could balance himself with one hand on an inverted ginger-ale bottle while revolving a barrel on the soles of his feet . There is good in all of us . “ I have been asked , ” repeated Mr. Faucitt , ignoring the unmannerly interruption , which , indeed , he would have found it hard to answer , “ to propose the health of our charming hostess ( applause ) , coupled with the name of her brother , our old friend Fillmore Nicholas. ” The gentleman referred to , who sat at the speaker 's end of the table , acknowledged the tribute with a brief nod of the head . It was a nod of condescension ; the nod of one who , conscious of being hedged about by social inferiors , nevertheless does his best to be not unkindly . And Sally , seeing it , debated in her mind for an instant the advisability of throwing an orange at her brother . There was one lying ready to her hand , and his glistening shirt-front offered an admirable mark ; but she restrained herself . After all , if a hostess yields to her primitive impulses , what happens ? Chaos . She had just frowned down the exuberance of the rebellious Murphys , and she felt that if , even with the highest motives , she began throwing fruit , her influence for good in that quarter would be weakened . She leaned back with a sigh . The temptation had been hard to resist . A democratic girl , pomposity was a quality which she thoroughly disliked ; and though she loved him , she could not disguise from herself that , ever since affluence had descended upon him some months ago , her brother Fillmore had become insufferably pompous . If there are any young men whom inherited wealth improves , Fillmore Nicholas was not one of them . He seemed to regard himself nowadays as a sort of Man of Destiny . To converse with him was for the ordinary human being like being received in audience by some more than stand-offish monarch . It had taken Sally over an hour to persuade him to leave his apartment on Riverside Drive and revisit the boarding-house for this special occasion ; and , when he had come , he had entered wearing such faultless evening dress that he had made the rest of the party look like a gathering of tramp-cyclists . His white waistcoat alone was a silent reproach to honest poverty , and had caused an awkward constraint right through the soup and fish courses . Most of those present had known Fillmore Nicholas as an impecunious young man who could make a tweed suit last longer than one would have believed possible ; they had called him “ Fill ” and helped him in more than usually lean times with small loans : but to-night they had eyed the waistcoat dumbly and shrank back abashed . “ Speaking , ” said Mr. Faucitt , “ as an Englishman -- for though I have long since taken out what are technically known as my 'papers ' it was as a subject of the island kingdom that I first visited this great country -- I may say that the two factors in American life which have always made the profoundest impression upon me have been the lavishness of American hospitality and the charm of the American girl . To-night we have been privileged to witness the American girl in the capacity of hostess , and I think I am right in saying , in asseverating , in committing myself to the statement that this has been a night which none of us present here will ever forget . Miss Nicholas has given us , ladies and gentlemen , a banquet . I repeat , a banquet . There has been alcoholic refreshment . I do not know where it came from : I do not ask how it was procured , but we have had it . Miss Nicholas ... ” Mr. Faucitt paused to puff at his cigar . Sally 's brother Fillmore suppressed a yawn and glanced at his watch . Sally continued to lean forward raptly . She knew how happy it made the old gentleman to deliver a formal speech ; and though she wished the subject had been different , she was prepared to listen indefinitely . “ Miss Nicholas , ” resumed Mr. Faucitt , lowering his cigar , “ ... But why , ” he demanded abruptly , “ do I call her Miss Nicholas ? ” “ Because it 's her name , ” hazarded the taller Murphy . Mr. Faucitt eyed him with disfavour . He disapproved of the marvellous brethren on general grounds because , himself a resident of years standing , he considered that these transients from the vaudeville stage lowered the tone of the boarding-house ; but particularly because the one who had just spoken had , on his first evening in the place , addressed him as “ grandpa. ” “ Yes , sir , ” he said severely , “ it is her name . But she has another name , sweeter to those who love her , those who worship her , those who have watched her with the eye of sedulous affection through the three years she has spent beneath this roof , though that name , ” said Mr. Faucitt , lowering the tone of his address and descending to what might almost be termed personalities , “ may not be familiar to a couple of dud acrobats who have only been in the place a week-end , thank heaven , and are off to-morrow to infest some other city . That name , ” said Mr. Faucitt , soaring once more to a loftier plane , “ is Sally . Our Sally . For three years our Sally has flitted about this establishment like -- I choose the simile advisedly -- like a ray of sunshine . For three years she has made life for us a brighter , sweeter thing . And now a sudden access of worldly wealth , happily synchronizing with her twenty-first birthday , is to remove her from our midst . From our midst , ladies and gentlemen , but not from our hearts . And I think I may venture to hope , to prognosticate , that , whatever lofty sphere she may adorn in the future , to whatever heights in the social world she may soar , she will still continue to hold a corner in her own golden heart for the comrades of her Bohemian days . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you our hostess , Miss Sally Nicholas , coupled with the name of our old friend , her brother Fillmore. ” Sally , watching her brother heave himself to his feet as the cheers died away , felt her heart beat a little faster with anticipation . Fillmore was a fluent young man , once a power in his college debating society , and it was for that reason that she had insisted on his coming here tonight . She had guessed that Mr. Faucitt , the old dear , would say all sorts of delightful things about her , and she had mistrusted her ability to make a fitting reply . And it was imperative that a fitting reply should proceed from someone . She knew Mr. Faucitt so well . He looked on these occasions rather in the light of scenes from some play ; and , sustaining his own part in them with such polished grace , was certain to be pained by anything in the nature of an anti-climax after he should have ceased to take the stage . Eloquent himself , he must be answered with eloquence , or his whole evening would be spoiled . Fillmore Nicholas smoothed a wrinkle out of his white waistcoat ; and having rested one podgy hand on the table-cloth and the thumb of the other in his pocket , glanced down the table with eyes so haughtily drooping that Sally 's fingers closed automatically about her orange , as she wondered whether even now it might not be a good thing ... It seems to be one of Nature 's laws that the most attractive girls should have the least attractive brothers . Fillmore Nicholas had not worn well . At the age of seven he had been an extraordinarily beautiful child , but after that he had gone all to pieces ; and now , at the age of twenty-five , it would be idle to deny that he was something of a mess . For the three years preceding his twenty-fifth birthday , restricted means and hard work had kept his figure in check ; but with money there had come an ever-increasing sleekness . He looked as if he fed too often and too well . All this , however , Sally was prepared to forgive him , if he would only make a good speech . She could see Mr. Faucitt leaning back in his chair , all courteous attention . Rolling periods were meat and drink to the old gentleman . Fillmore spoke . “ I 'm sure , ” said Fillmore , “ you do n't want a speech ... Very good of you to drink our health . Thank you. ” He sat down . The effect of these few simple words on the company was marked , but not in every case identical . To the majority the emotion which they brought was one of unmixed relief . There had been something so menacing , so easy and practised , in Fillmore 's attitude as he had stood there that the gloomier-minded had given him at least twenty minutes , and even the optimists had reckoned that they would be lucky if they got off with ten . As far as the bulk of the guests were concerned , there was no grumbling . Fillmore 's , to their thinking , had been the ideal after-dinner speech . Far different was it with Mr. Maxwell Faucitt . The poor old man was wearing such an expression of surprise and dismay as he might have worn had somebody unexpectedly pulled the chair from under him . He was feeling the sick shock which comes to those who tread on a non-existent last stair . And Sally , catching sight of his face , uttered a sharp wordless exclamation as if she had seen a child fall down and hurt itself in the street . The next moment she had run round the table and was standing behind him with her arms round his neck . She spoke across him with a sob in her voice . “ My brother , ” she stammered , directing a malevolent look at the immaculate Fillmore , who , avoiding her gaze , glanced down his nose and smoothed another wrinkle out of his waistcoat , “ has not said quite -- quite all I hoped he was going to say . I ca n't make a speech , but ... ” Sally gulped , “ ... but , I love you all and of course I shall never forget you , and ... and ... ” Here Sally kissed Mr. Faucitt and burst into tears . “ There , there , ” said Mr. Faucitt , soothingly . The kindest critic could not have claimed that Sally had been eloquent : nevertheless Mr. Maxwell Faucitt was conscious of no sense of anti-climax . 2 Sally had just finished telling her brother Fillmore what a pig he was . The lecture had taken place in the street outside the boarding-house immediately on the conclusion of the festivities , when Fillmore , who had furtively collected his hat and overcoat , had stolen forth into the night , had been overtaken and brought to bay by his justly indignant sister . Her remarks , punctuated at intervals by bleating sounds from the accused , had lasted some ten minutes . As she paused for breath , Fillmore seemed to expand , like an indiarubber ball which has been sat on . Dignified as he was to the world , he had never been able to prevent himself being intimidated by Sally when in one of these moods of hers . He regretted this , for it hurt his self-esteem , but he did not see how the fact could be altered . Sally had always been like that . Even the uncle , who after the deaths of their parents had become their guardian , had never , though a grim man , been able to cope successfully with Sally . In that last hectic scene three years ago , which had ended in their going out into the world , together like a second Adam and Eve , the verbal victory had been hers . And it had been Sally who had achieved triumph in the one battle which Mrs. Meecher , apparently as a matter of duty , always brought about with each of her patrons in the first week of their stay . A sweet-tempered girl , Sally , like most women of a generous spirit , had cyclonic potentialities . As she seemed to have said her say , Fillmore kept on expanding till he had reached the normal , when he ventured upon a speech for the defence . “ What have I done ? ” demanded Fillmore plaintively . “ Do you want to hear all over again ? ” “ No , no , ” said Fillmore hastily . “ But , listen , Sally , you don't understand my position . You do n't seem to realize that all that sort of thing , all that boarding-house stuff , is a thing of the past . One 's got beyond it . One wants to drop it . One wants to forget it , darn it ! Be fair . Look at it from my viewpoint . I 'm going to be a big man ... ” “ You 're going to be a fat man , ” said Sally , coldly . Fillmore refrained from discussing the point . He was sensitive . “ I 'm going to do big things , ” he substituted . “ I 've got a deal on at this very moment which ... well , I ca n't tell you about it , but it's going to be big . Well , what I 'm driving at , is about all this sort of thing ” -- he indicated the lighted front of Mrs. Meecher 's home-from-home with a wide gesture -- “ is that it 's over . Finished and done with . These people were all very well when ... ” “ ... when you 'd lost your week 's salary at poker and wanted to borrow a few dollars for the rent. ” “ I always paid them back , ” protested Fillmore , defensively . “ I did. ” “ Well , we did , ” said Fillmore , accepting the amendment with the air of a man who has no time for chopping straws . “ Anyway , what I mean is , I do n't see why , just because one has known people at a certain period in one 's life when one was practically down and out , one should have them round one 's neck for ever . One ca n't prevent people forming an I-knew-him-when club , but , darn it , one need n't attend the meetings. ” “ One 's friends ... ” “ Oh , friends , ” said Fillmore . “ That 's just where all this makes me so tired . One 's in a position where all these people are entitled to call themselves one 's friends , simply because father put it in his will that I was n't to get the money till I was twenty-five , instead of letting me have it at twenty-one like anybody else . I wonder where I should have been by now if I could have got that money when I was twenty-one. ” “ In the poor-house , probably , ” said Sally . Fillmore was wounded . “ Ah ! you do n't believe in me , ” he sighed . “ Oh , you would be all right if you had one thing , ” said Sally . Fillmore passed his qualities in swift review before his mental eye . Brains ? Dash ? Spaciousness ? Initiative ? All present and correct . He wondered where Sally imagined the hiatus to exist . “ One thing ? ” he said . “ What 's that ? ” “ A nurse. ” Fillmore 's sense of injury deepened . He supposed that this was always the way , that those nearest to a man never believed in his ability till he had proved it so masterfully that it no longer required the assistance of faith . Still , it was trying ; and there was not much consolation to be derived from the thought that Napoleon had had to go through this sort of thing in his day . “ I shall find my place in the world , ” he said sulkily . “ Oh , you 'll find your place all right , ” said Sally . “ And I 'll come round and bring you jelly and read to you on the days when visitors are allowed ... Oh , hullo. ” The last remark was addressed to a young man who had been swinging briskly along the sidewalk from the direction of Broadway and who now , coming abreast of them , stopped . “ Good evening , Mr. Foster. ” “ Good evening . Miss Nicholas. ” “ You do n't know my brother , do you ? ” “ I do n't believe I do. ” “ He left the underworld before you came to it , ” said Sally . “ You would n't think it to look at him , but he was once a prune-eater among the proletariat , even as you and I. Mrs. Meecher looks on him as a son. ” The two men shook hands . Fillmore was not short , but Gerald Foster with his lean , well-built figure seemed to tower over him . He was an Englishman , a man in the middle twenties , clean-shaven , keen-eyed , and very good to look at . Fillmore , who had recently been going in for one of those sum-up-your-fellow-man-at-a-glance courses , the better to fit himself for his career of greatness , was rather impressed . It seemed to him that this Mr. Foster , like himself , was one of those who Get There . If you are that kind yourself , you get into the knack of recognizing the others . It is a sort of gift . There was a few moments of desultory conversation , of the kind that usually follows an introduction , and then Fillmore , by no means sorry to get the chance , took advantage of the coming of this new arrival to remove himself . He had not enjoyed his chat with Sally , and it seemed probable that he would enjoy a continuation of it even less . He was glad that Mr. Foster had happened along at this particular juncture . Excusing himself briefly , he hurried off down the street . Sally stood for a minute , watching him till he had disappeared round the corner . She had a slightly regretful feeling that , now it was too late , she would think of a whole lot more good things which it would have been agreeable to say to him . And it had become obvious to her that Fillmore was not getting nearly enough of that kind of thing said to him nowadays . Then she dismissed him from her mind and turning to Gerald Foster , slipped her arm through his . “ Well , Jerry , darling , ” she said . “ What a shame you could n't come to the party . Tell me all about everything. ” 3 It was exactly two months since Sally had become engaged to Gerald Foster ; but so rigorously had they kept the secret that nobody at Mrs. Meecher 's so much as suspected it . To Sally , who all her life had hated concealing things , secrecy of any kind was objectionable : but in this matter Gerald had shown an odd streak almost of furtiveness in his character . An announced engagement complicated life . People fussed about you and bothered you . People either watched you or avoided you . Such were his arguments , and Sally , who would have glossed over and found excuses for a disposition on his part towards homicide or arson , put them down to artistic sensitiveness . There is nobody so sensitive as your artist , particularly if he be unsuccessful : and when an artist has so little success that he can not afford to make a home for the woman he loves , his sensitiveness presumably becomes great indeed . Putting herself in his place , Sally could see that a protracted engagement , known by everybody , would be a standing advertisement of Gerald's failure to make good : and she acquiesced in the policy of secrecy , hoping that it would not last long . It seemed absurd to think of Gerald as an unsuccessful man . He had in him , as the recent Fillmore had perceived , something dynamic . He was one of those men of whom one could predict that they would succeed very suddenly and rapidly -- overnight , as it were . “ The party , ” said Sally , “ went off splendidly. ” They had passed the boarding-house door , and were walking slowly down the street . “ Everybody enjoyed themselves , I think , even though Fillmore did his best to spoil things by coming looking like an advertisement of What The Smart Men Will Wear This Season . You did n't see his waistcoat just now . He had covered it up . Conscience , I suppose . It was white and bulgy and gleaming and full up of pearl buttons and everything . I saw Augustus Bartlett curl up like a burnt feather when he caught sight of it . Still , time seemed to heal the wound , and everybody relaxed after a bit . Mr. Faucitt made a speech and I made a speech and cried , and ... oh , it was all very festive . It only needed you. ” “ I wish I could have come . I had to go to that dinner , though . Sally ... ” Gerald paused , and Sally saw that he was electric with suppressed excitement . “ Sally , the play 's going to be put on ! ” Sally gave a little gasp . She had lived this moment in anticipation for weeks . She had always known that sooner or later this would happen . She had read his plays over and over again , and was convinced that they were wonderful . Of course , hers was a biased view , but then Elsa Doland also admired them ; and Elsa 's opinion was one that carried weight . Elsa was another of those people who were bound to succeed suddenly . Even old Mr. Faucitt , who was a stern judge of acting and rather inclined to consider that nowadays there was no such thing , believed that she was a girl with a future who would do something big directly she got her chance . “ Jerry ! ” She gave his arm a hug . “ How simply terrific ! Then Goble and Kohn have changed their minds after all and want it ? I knew they would. ” A slight cloud seemed to dim the sunniness of the author 's mood . “ No , not that one , ” he said reluctantly . “ No hope there , I 'm afraid . I saw Goble this morning about that , and he said it did n't add up right . The one that 's going to be put on is 'The Primrose Way . ' You remember ? It 's got a big part for a girl in it. ” “ Of course ! The one Elsa liked so much . Well , that 's just as good . Who's going to do it ? I thought you had n't sent it out again. ” “ Well , it happens ... ” Gerald hesitated once more . “ It seems that this man I was dining with to-night -- a man named Cracknell ... ” “ Cracknell ? Not the Cracknell ? ” “ The Cracknell ? ” “ The one people are always talking about . The man they call the Millionaire Kid. ” “ Yes . Why , do you know him ? ” “ He was at Harvard with Fillmore . I never saw him , but he must be rather a painful person. ” “ Oh , he 's all right . Not much brains , of course , but -- well , he 's all right . And , anyway , he wants to put the play on. ” “ Well , that 's splendid , ” said Sally : but she could not get the right ring of enthusiasm into her voice . She had had ideals for Gerald . She had dreamed of him invading Broadway triumphantly under the banner of one of the big managers whose name carried a prestige , and there seemed something unworthy in this association with a man whose chief claim to eminence lay in the fact that he was credited by metropolitan gossip with possessing the largest private stock of alcohol in existence . “ I thought you would be pleased , ” said Gerald . “ Oh , I am , ” said Sally . With the buoyant optimism which never deserted her for long , she had already begun to cast off her momentary depression . After all , did it matter who financed a play so long as it obtained a production ? A manager was simply a piece of machinery for paying the bills ; and if he had money for that purpose , why demand asceticism and the finer sensibilities from him ? The real thing that mattered was the question of who was going to play the leading part , that deftly drawn character which had so excited the admiration of Elsa Doland . She sought information on this point . “ Who will play Ruth ? ” she asked . “ You must have somebody wonderful . It needs a tremendously clever woman . Did Mr. Cracknell say anything about that ? ” “ Oh , yes , we discussed that , of course. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , it seems ... ” Again Sally noticed that odd , almost stealthy embarrassment . Gerald appeared unable to begin a sentence to-night without feeling his way into it like a man creeping cautiously down a dark alley . She noticed it the more because it was so different from his usual direct method . Gerald , as a rule , was not one of those who apologize for themselves . He was forthright and masterful and inclined to talk to her from a height . To-night he seemed different . He broke off , was silent for a moment , and began again with a question . “ Do you know Mabel Hobson ? ” “ Mabel Hobson ? I 've seen her in the 'Follies , ' of course. ” Sally started . A suspicion had stung her , so monstrous that its absurdity became manifest the moment it had formed . And yet was it absurd ? Most Broadway gossip filtered eventually into the boarding-house , chiefly through the medium of that seasoned sport , the mild young man who thought so highly of the redoubtable Benny Whistler , and she was aware that the name of Reginald Cracknell , which was always getting itself linked with somebody , had been coupled with that of Miss Hobson . It seemed likely that in this instance rumour spoke truth , for the lady was of that compellingly blonde beauty which attracts the Cracknells of this world . But even so ... “ It seems that Cracknell ... ” said Gerald . “ Apparently this man Cracknell ... ” He was finding Sally 's bright , horrified gaze somewhat trying . “ Well , the fact is Cracknell believes in Mabel Hobson ... and ... well , he thinks this part would suit her. ” “ Oh , Jerry ! ” Could infatuation go to such a length ? Could even the spacious heart of a Reginald Cracknell so dominate that gentleman 's small size in heads as to make him entrust a part like Ruth in “ The Primrose Way ” to one who , when desired by the producer of her last revue to carry a bowl of roses across the stage and place it on a table , had rebelled on the plea that she had not been engaged as a dancer ? Surely even lovelorn Reginald could perceive that this was not the stuff of which great emotional actresses are made . “ Oh , Jerry ! ” she said again . There was an uncomfortable silence . They turned and walked back in the direction of the boarding-house . Somehow Gerald 's arm had managed to get itself detached from Sally 's . She was conscious of a curious dull ache that was almost like a physical pain . “ Jerry ! Is it worth it ? ” she burst out vehemently . The question seemed to sting the young man into something like his usual decisive speech . “ Worth it ? Of course it 's worth it . It 's a Broadway production . That's all that matters . Good heavens ! I 've been trying long enough to get a play on Broadway , and it is n't likely that I 'm going to chuck away my chance when it comes along just because one might do better in the way of casting. ” “ But , Jerry ! Mabel Hobson ! It 's ... it 's murder ! Murder in the first degree. ” “ Nonsense . She 'll be all right . The part will play itself . Besides , she has a personality and a following , and Cracknell will spend all the money in the world to make the thing a success . And it will be a start , whatever happens . Of course , it 's worth it. ” Fillmore would have been impressed by this speech . He would have recognized and respected in it the unmistakable ring which characterizes even the lightest utterances of those who get there . On Sally it had not immediately that effect . Nevertheless , her habit of making the best of things , working together with that primary article of her creed that the man she loved could do no wrong , succeeded finally in raising her spirits . Of course Jerry was right . It would have been foolish to refuse a contract because all its clauses were not ideal . “ You old darling , ” she said affectionately attaching herself to the vacant arm once more and giving it a penitent squeeze , “ you 're quite right . Of course you are . I can see it now . I was only a little startled at first . Everything 's going to be wonderful . Let 's get all our chickens out and count 'em . How are you going to spend the money ? ” “ I know how I 'm going to spend a dollar of it , ” said Gerald completely restored . “ I mean the big money . What 's a dollar ? ” “ It pays for a marriage-licence. ” Sally gave his arm another squeeze . “ Ladies and gentlemen , ” she said . “ Look at this man . Observe him . My partner ! ” CHAPTER II . ENTER GINGER 1 Sally was sitting with her back against a hillock of golden sand , watching with half-closed eyes the denizens of Roville-sur-Mer at their familiar morning occupations . At Roville , as at most French seashore resorts , the morning is the time when the visiting population assembles in force on the beach . Whiskered fathers of families made cheerful patches of colour in the foreground . Their female friends and relatives clustered in groups under gay parasols . Dogs roamed to and fro , and children dug industriously with spades , ever and anon suspending their labours in order to smite one another with these handy implements . One of the dogs , a poodle of military aspect , wandered up to Sally : and discovering that she was in possession of a box of sweets , decided to remain and await developments . Few things are so pleasant as the anticipation of them , but Sally's vacation had proved an exception to this rule . It had been a magic month of lazy happiness . She had drifted luxuriously from one French town to another , till the charm of Roville , with its blue sky , its Casino , its snow-white hotels along the Promenade , and its general glitter and gaiety , had brought her to a halt . Here she could have stayed indefinitely , but the voice of America was calling her back . Gerald had written to say that “ The Primrose Way ” was to be produced in Detroit , preliminary to its New York run , so soon that , if she wished to see the opening , she must return at once . A scrappy , hurried , unsatisfactory letter , the letter of a busy man : but one that Sally could not ignore . She was leaving Roville to-morrow . To-day , however , was to-day : and she sat and watched the bathers with a familiar feeling of peace , revelling as usual in the still novel sensation of having nothing to do but bask in the warm sunshine and listen to the faint murmur of the little waves . But , if there was one drawback , she had discovered , to a morning on the Roville plage , it was that you had a tendency to fall asleep : and this is a degrading thing to do so soon after breakfast , even if you are on a holiday . Usually , Sally fought stoutly against the temptation , but to-day the sun was so warm and the whisper of the waves so insinuating that she had almost dozed off , when she was aroused by voices close at hand . There were many voices on the beach , both near and distant , but these were talking English , a novelty in Roville , and the sound of the familiar tongue jerked Sally back from the borders of sleep . A few feet away , two men had seated themselves on the sand . From the first moment she had set out on her travels , it had been one of Sally 's principal amusements to examine the strangers whom chance threw in her way and to try by the light of her intuition to fit them out with characters and occupations : nor had she been discouraged by an almost consistent failure to guess right . Out of the corner of her eye she inspected these two men . The first of the pair did not attract her . He was a tall , dark man whose tight , precise mouth and rather high cheeks bones gave him an appearance vaguely sinister . He had the dusky look of the clean-shaven man whose life is a perpetual struggle with a determined beard . He certainly shaved twice a day , and just as certainly had the self-control not to swear when he cut himself . She could picture him smiling nastily when this happened . “ Hard , ” diagnosed Sally . “ I should n't like him . A lawyer or something , I think. ” She turned to the other and found herself looking into his eyes . This was because he had been staring at Sally with the utmost intentness ever since his arrival . His mouth had opened slightly . He had the air of a man who , after many disappointments , has at last found something worth looking at . “ Rather a dear , ” decided Sally . He was a sturdy , thick-set young man with an amiable , freckled face and the reddest hair Sally had ever seen . He had a square chin , and at one angle of the chin a slight cut . And Sally was convinced that , however he had behaved on receipt of that wound , it had not been with superior self-control . “ A temper , I should think , ” she meditated . “ Very quick , but soon over . Not very clever , I should say , but nice. ” She looked away , finding his fascinated gaze a little embarrassing . The dark man , who in the objectionably competent fashion which , one felt , characterized all his actions , had just succeeded in lighting a cigarette in the teeth of a strong breeze , threw away the match and resumed the conversation , which had presumably been interrupted by the process of sitting down . “ And how is Scrymgeour ? ” he inquired . “ Oh , all right , ” replied the young man with red hair absently . Sally was looking straight in front of her , but she felt that his eyes were still busy . “ I was surprised at his being here . He told me he meant to stay in Paris. ” There was a slight pause . Sally gave the attentive poodle a piece of nougat . “ I say , ” observed the red-haired young man in clear , penetrating tones that vibrated with intense feeling , “ that 's the prettiest girl I 've seen in my life ! ” 2 At this frank revelation of the red-haired young man 's personal opinions , Sally , though considerably startled , was not displeased . A broad-minded girl , the outburst seemed to her a legitimate comment on a matter of public interest . The young man 's companion , on the other hand , was unmixedly shocked . “ My dear fellow ! ” he ejaculated . “ Oh , it 's all right , ” said the red-haired young man , unmoved . “ She can't understand . There is n't a bally soul in this dashed place that can speak a word of English . If I did n't happen to remember a few odd bits of French , I should have starved by this time . That girl , ” he went on , returning to the subject most imperatively occupying his mind , “ is an absolute topper ! I give you my solemn word I 've never seen anybody to touch her . Look at those hands and feet . You do n't get them outside France . Of course , her mouth is a bit wide , ” he said reluctantly . Sally 's immobility , added to the other 's assurance concerning the linguistic deficiencies of the inhabitants of Roville , seemed to reassure the dark man . He breathed again . At no period of his life had he ever behaved with anything but the most scrupulous correctness himself , but he had quailed at the idea of being associated even remotely with incorrectness in another . It had been a black moment for him when the red-haired young man had uttered those few kind words . “ Still you ought to be careful , ” he said austerely . He looked at Sally , who was now dividing her attention between the poodle and a raffish-looking mongrel , who had joined the party , and returned to the topic of the mysterious Scrymgeour . “ How is Scrymgeour 's dyspepsia ? ” The red-haired young man seemed but faintly interested in the vicissitudes of Scrymgeour 's interior . “ Do you notice the way her hair sort of curls over her ears ? ” he said . “ Eh ? Oh , pretty much the same , I think. ” “ What hotel are you staying at ? ” “ The Normandie. ” Sally , dipping into the box for another chocolate cream , gave an imperceptible start . She , too , was staying at the Normandie . She presumed that her admirer was a recent arrival , for she had seen nothing of him at the hotel . “ The Normandie ? ” The dark man looked puzzled . “ I know Roville pretty well by report , but I 've never heard of any Hotel Normandie . Where is it ? ” “ It 's a little shanty down near the station . Not much of a place . Still , it 's cheap , and the cooking 's all right. ” His companion 's bewilderment increased . “ What on earth is a man like Scrymgeour doing there ? ” he said . Sally was conscious of an urgent desire to know more and more about the absent Scrymgeour . Constant repetition of his name had made him seem almost like an old friend . “ If there 's one thing he 's fussy about ... ” “ There are at least eleven thousand things he 's fussy about , ” interrupted the red-haired young man disapprovingly . “ Jumpy old blighter ! ” “ If there 's one thing he 's particular about , it 's the sort of hotel he goes to . Ever since I 've known him he has always wanted the best . I should have thought he would have gone to the Splendide. ” He mused on this problem in a dissatisfied sort of way for a moment , then seemed to reconcile himself to the fact that a rich man 's eccentricities must be humoured . “ I 'd like to see him again . Ask him if he will dine with me at the Splendide to-night . Say eight sharp. ” Sally , occupied with her dogs , whose numbers had now been augmented by a white terrier with a black patch over its left eye , could not see the young man 's face : but his voice , when he replied , told her that something was wrong . There was a false airiness in it . “ Oh , Scrymgeour is n't in Roville. ” “ No ? Where is he ? ” “ Paris , I believe. ” “ What ! ” The dark man 's voice sharpened . He sounded as though he were cross-examining a reluctant witness . “ Then why are n't you there ? What are you doing here ? Did he give you a holiday ? ” “ Yes , he did. ” “ When do you rejoin him ? ” “ I don't. ” “ What ! ” The red-haired young man 's manner was not unmistakably dogged . “ Well , if you want to know , ” he said , “ the old blighter fired me the day before yesterday. ” 3 There was a shuffling of sand as the dark man sprang up . Sally , intent on the drama which was unfolding itself beside her , absent-mindedly gave the poodle a piece of nougat which should by rights have gone to the terrier . She shot a swift glance sideways , and saw the dark man standing in an attitude rather reminiscent of the stern father of melodrama about to drive his erring daughter out into the snow . The red-haired young man , outwardly stolid , was gazing before him down the beach at a fat bather in an orange suit who , after six false starts , was now actually in the water , floating with the dignity of a wrecked balloon . “ Do you mean to tell me , ” demanded the dark man , “ that , after all the trouble the family took to get you what was practically a sinecure with endless possibilities if you only behaved yourself , you have deliberately thrown away ... ” A despairing gesture completed the sentence . “ Good God , you 're hopeless ! ” The red-haired young man made no reply . He continued to gaze down the beach . Of all outdoor sports , few are more stimulating than watching middle-aged Frenchmen bathe . Drama , action , suspense , all are here . From the first stealthy testing of the water with an apprehensive toe to the final seal-like plunge , there is never a dull moment . And apart from the excitement of the thing , judging it from a purely aesthetic standpoint , his must be a dull soul who can fail to be uplifted by the spectacle of a series of very stout men with whiskers , seen in tight bathing suits against a background of brightest blue . Yet the young man with red hair , recently in the employment of Mr. Scrymgeour , eyed this free circus without any enjoyment whatever . “ It 's maddening ! What are you going to do ? What do you expect us to do ? Are we to spend our whole lives getting you positions which you won't keep ? I can tell you we 're ... it 's monstrous ! It 's sickening ! Good God ! ” And with these words the dark man , apparently feeling , as Sally had sometimes felt in the society of her brother Fillmore , the futility of mere language , turned sharply and stalked away up the beach , the dignity of his exit somewhat marred a moment later by the fact of his straw hat blowing off and being trodden on by a passing child . He left behind him the sort of electric calm which follows the falling of a thunderbolt ; that stunned calm through which the air seems still to quiver protestingly . How long this would have lasted one can not say : for towards the end of the first minute it was shattered by a purely terrestrial uproar . With an abruptness heralded only by one short , low gurgling snarl , there sprang into being the prettiest dog fight that Roville had seen that season . It was the terrier with the black patch who began it . That was Sally's opinion : and such , one feels , will be the verdict of history . His best friend , anxious to make out a case for him , could not have denied that he fired the first gun of the campaign . But we must be just . The fault was really Sally 's . Absorbed in the scene which had just concluded and acutely inquisitive as to why the shadowy Scrymgeour had seen fit to dispense with the red-haired young man 's services , she had thrice in succession helped the poodle out of his turn . The third occasion was too much for the terrier . There is about any dog fight a wild , gusty fury which affects the average mortal with something of the helplessness induced by some vast clashing of the elements . It seems so outside one 's jurisdiction . One is oppressed with a sense of the futility of interference . And this was no ordinary dog fight . It was a stunning mêlée , which would have excited favourable comment even among the blasé residents of a negro quarter or the not easily-pleased critics of a Lancashire mining-village . From all over the beach dogs of every size , breed , and colour were racing to the scene : and while some of these merely remained in the ringside seats and barked , a considerable proportion immediately started fighting one another on general principles , well content to be in action without bothering about first causes . The terrier had got the poodle by the left hind-leg and was restating his war-aims . The raffish mongrel was apparently endeavouring to fletcherize a complete stranger of the Sealyham family . Sally was frankly unequal to the situation , as were the entire crowd of spectators who had come galloping up from the water 's edge . She had been paralysed from the start . Snarling bundles bumped against her legs and bounced away again , but she made no move . Advice in fluent French rent the air . Arms waved , and well-filled bathing suits leaped up and down . But nobody did anything practical until in the centre of the theatre of war there suddenly appeared the red-haired young man . The only reason why dog fights do not go on for ever is that Providence has decided that on each such occasion there shall always be among those present one Master Mind ; one wizard who , whatever his shortcomings in other battles of life , is in this single particular sphere competent and dominating . At Roville-sur-Mer it was the red-haired young man . His dark companion might have turned from him in disgust : his services might not have seemed worth retaining by the haughty Scrymgeour : he might be a pain in the neck to “ the family ” ; but he did know how to stop a dog fight . From the first moment of his intervention calm began to steal over the scene . He had the same effect on the almost inextricably entwined belligerents as , in mediaeval legend , the Holy Grail , sliding down the sunbeam , used to have on battling knights . He did not look like a dove of peace , but the most captious could not have denied that he brought home the goods . There was a magic in his soothing hands , a spell in his voice : and in a shorter time than one would have believed possible dog after dog had been sorted out and calmed down ; until presently all that was left of Armageddon was one solitary small Scotch terrier , thoughtfully licking a chewed leg . The rest of the combatants , once more in their right mind and wondering what all the fuss was about , had been captured and haled away in a whirl of recrimination by voluble owners . Having achieved this miracle , the young man turned to Sally . Gallant , one might say reckless , as he had been a moment before , he now gave indications of a rather pleasing shyness . He braced himself with that painful air of effort which announces to the world that an Englishman is about to speak a language other than his own . “ J'espère , ” he said , having swallowed once or twice to brace himself up for the journey through the jungle of a foreign tongue , “ J'espère que vous n'êtes pas -- oh , dammit , what 's the word -- J'espère que vous n'êtes pas blessée ? ” “ Blessée ? ” “ Yes , blessée . Wounded . Hurt , do n't you know . Bitten . Oh , dash it . J'espère ... ” “ Oh , bitten ! ” said Sally , dimpling . “ Oh , no , thanks very much . I wasn't bitten . And I think it was awfully brave of you to save all our lives. ” The compliment seemed to pass over the young man 's head . He stared at Sally with horrified eyes . Over his amiable face there swept a vivid blush . His jaw dropped . “ Oh , my sainted aunt ! ” he ejaculated . Then , as if the situation was too much for him and flight the only possible solution , he spun round and disappeared at a walk so rapid that it was almost a run . Sally watched him go and was sorry that he had torn himself away . She still wanted to know why Scrymgeour had fired him . 4 Bedtime at Roville is an hour that seems to vary according to one's proximity to the sea . The gilded palaces along the front keep deplorable hours , polluting the night air till dawn with indefatigable jazz : but at the pensions of the economical like the Normandie , early to bed is the rule . True , Jules , the stout young native who combined the offices of night-clerk and lift attendant at that establishment , was on duty in the hall throughout the night , but few of the Normandie 's patrons made use of his services . Sally , entering shortly before twelve o'clock on the night of the day on which the dark man , the red-haired young man , and their friend Scrymgeour had come into her life , found the little hall dim and silent . Through the iron cage of the lift a single faint bulb glowed : another , over the desk in the far corner , illuminated the upper half of Jules , slumbering in a chair . Jules seemed to Sally to be on duty in some capacity or other all the time . His work , like women 's , was never done . He was now restoring his tissues with a few winks of much-needed beauty sleep . Sally , who had been to the Casino to hear the band and afterwards had strolled on the moonlit promenade , had a guilty sense of intrusion . As she stood there , reluctant to break in on Jules ' rest -- for her sympathetic heart , always at the disposal of the oppressed , had long ached for this overworked peon -- she was relieved to hear footsteps in the street outside , followed by the opening of the front door . If Jules would have had to wake up anyway , she felt her sense of responsibility lessened . The door , having opened , closed again with a bang . Jules stirred , gurgled , blinked , and sat up , and Sally , turning , perceived that the new arrival was the red-haired young man . “ Oh , good evening , ” said Sally welcomingly . The young man stopped , and shuffled uncomfortably . The morning's happenings were obviously still green in his memory . He had either not ceased blushing since their last meeting or he was celebrating their reunion by beginning to blush again : for his face was a familiar scarlet . “ Er -- good evening , ” he said , disentangling his feet , which , in the embarrassment of the moment , had somehow got coiled up together . “ Or bon soir , I suppose you would say , ” murmured Sally . The young man acknowledged receipt of this thrust by dropping his hat and tripping over it as he stooped to pick it up . Jules , meanwhile , who had been navigating in a sort of somnambulistic trance in the neighbourhood of the lift , now threw back the cage with a rattle . “ It 's a shame to have woken you up , ” said Sally , commiseratingly , stepping in . Jules did not reply , for the excellent reason that he had not been woken up . Constant practice enabled him to do this sort of work without breaking his slumber . His brain , if you could call it that , was working automatically . He had shut up the gate with a clang and was tugging sluggishly at the correct rope , so that the lift was going slowly up instead of retiring down into the basement , but he was not awake . Sally and the red-haired young man sat side by side on the small seat , watching their conductor 's efforts . After the first spurt , conversation had languished . Sally had nothing of immediate interest to say , and her companion seemed to be one of these strong , silent men you read about . Only a slight snore from Jules broke the silence . At the third floor Sally leaned forward and prodded Jules in the lower ribs . All through her stay at Roville , she had found in dealing with the native population that actions spoke louder than words . If she wanted anything in a restaurant or at a shop , she pointed ; and , when she wished the lift to stop , she prodded the man in charge . It was a system worth a dozen French conversation books . Jules brought the machine to a halt : and it was at this point that he should have done the one thing connected with his professional activities which he did really well -- the opening , to wit , of the iron cage . There are ways of doing this . Jules ' was the right way . He was accustomed to do it with a flourish , and generally remarked “ V'la ! ” in a modest but self-congratulatory voice as though he would have liked to see another man who could have put through a job like that . Jules' opinion was that he might not be much to look at , but that he could open a lift door . To-night , however , it seemed as if even this not very exacting feat was beyond his powers . Instead of inserting his key in the lock , he stood staring in an attitude of frozen horror . He was a man who took most things in life pretty seriously , and whatever was the little difficulty just now seemed to have broken him all up . “ There appears , ” said Sally , turning to her companion , “ to be a hitch . Would you mind asking what 's the matter ? I do n't know any French myself except 'oo la la ! ' ” The young man , thus appealed to , nerved himself to the task . He eyed the melancholy Jules doubtfully , and coughed in a strangled sort of way . “ Oh , esker ... esker vous ... ” “ Do n't weaken , ” said Sally . “ I think you 've got him going. ” “ Esker vous ... Pourquoi vous ne ... I mean ne vous ... that is to say , quel est le raison ... ” He broke off here , because at this point Jules began to explain . He explained very rapidly and at considerable length . The fact that neither of his hearers understood a word of what he was saying appeared not to have impressed itself upon him . Or , if he gave a thought to it , he dismissed the objection as trifling . He wanted to explain , and he explained . Words rushed from him like water from a geyser . Sounds which you felt you would have been able to put a meaning to if he had detached them from the main body and repeated them slowly , went swirling down the stream and were lost for ever . “ Stop him ! ” said Sally firmly . The red-haired young man looked as a native of Johnstown might have looked on being requested to stop that city 's celebrated flood . “ Stop him ? ” “ Yes . Blow a whistle or something. ” Out of the depths of the young man 's memory there swam to the surface a single word -- a word which he must have heard somewhere or read somewhere : a legacy , perhaps , from long-vanished school-days . “ Zut ! ” he barked , and instantaneously Jules turned himself off at the main . There was a moment of dazed silence , such as might occur in a boiler-factory if the works suddenly shut down . “ Quick ! Now you 've got him ! ” cried Sally . “ Ask him what he 's talking about -- if he knows , which I doubt -- and tell him to speak slowly . Then we shall get somewhere. ” The young man nodded intelligently . The advice was good . “ Lentement , ” he said . “ Parlez lentement . Pas si -- you know what I mean -- pas si dashed vite ! ” “ Ah-a-ah ! ” cried Jules , catching the idea on the fly . “ Lentement . Ah , oui , lentement. ” There followed a lengthy conversation which , while conveying nothing to Sally , seemed intelligible to the red-haired linguist . “ The silly ass , ” he was able to announce some few minutes later , “ has made a bloomer . Apparently he was half asleep when we came in , and he shoved us into the lift and slammed the door , forgetting that he had left the keys on the desk. ” “ I see , ” said Sally . “ So we 're shut in ? ” “ I 'm afraid so . I wish to goodness , ” said the young man , “ I knew French well . I 'd curse him with some vim and not a little animation , the chump ! I wonder what 'blighter ' is in French , ” he said , meditating . “ It 's the merest suggestion , ” said Sally , “ but ought n't we to do something ? ” “ What could we do ? ” “ Well , for one thing , we might all utter a loud yell . It would scare most of the people in the hotel to death , but there might be a survivor or two who would come and investigate and let us out. ” “ What a ripping idea ! ” said the young man , impressed . “ I 'm glad you like it . Now tell him the main out-line , or he 'll think we 've gone mad. ” The young man searched for words , and eventually found some which expressed his meaning lamely but well enough to cause Jules to nod in a depressed sort of way . “ Fine ! ” said Sally . “ Now , all together at the word 'three . ' One -- two -- Oh , poor darling ! ” she broke off . “ Look at him ! ” In the far corner of the lift , the emotional Jules was sobbing silently into the bunch of cotton-waste which served him in the office of a pocket-handkerchief . His broken-hearted gulps echoed hollowly down the shaft . 5 In these days of cheap books of instruction on every subject under the sun , we most of us know how to behave in the majority of life 's little crises . We have only ourselves to blame if we are ignorant of what to do before the doctor comes , of how to make a dainty winter coat for baby out of father 's last year 's under-vest and of the best method of coping with the cold mutton . But nobody yet has come forward with practical advice as to the correct method of behaviour to be adopted when a lift-attendant starts crying . And Sally and her companion , as a consequence , for a few moments merely stared at each other helplessly . “ Poor darling ! ” said Sally , finding speech . “ Ask him what 's the matter. ” The young man looked at her doubtfully . “ You know , ” he said , “ I do n't enjoy chatting with this blighter . I mean to say , it 's a bit of an effort . I do n't know why it is , but talking French always makes me feel as if my nose were coming off . Could n't we just leave him to have his cry out by himself ? ” “ The idea ! ” said Sally . “ Have you no heart ? Are you one of those fiends in human shape ? ” He turned reluctantly to Jules , and paused to overhaul his vocabulary . “ You ought to be thankful for this chance , ” said Sally . “ It 's the only real way of learning French , and you 're getting a lesson for nothing . What did he say then ? ” “ Something about losing something , it seemed to me . I thought I caught the word perdu. ” “ But that means a partridge , does n't it ? I 'm sure I 've seen it on the menus. ” “ Would he talk about partridges at a time like this ? ” “ He might . The French are extraordinary people. ” “ Well , I 'll have another go at him . But he 's a difficult chap to chat with . If you give him the least encouragement , he sort of goes off like a rocket. ” He addressed another question to the sufferer , and listened attentively to the voluble reply . “ Oh ! ” he said with sudden enlightenment . “ Your job ? ” He turned to Sally . “ I got it that time , ” he said . “ The trouble is , he says , that if we yell and rouse the house , we 'll get out all right , but he will lose his job , because this is the second time this sort of thing has happened , and they warned him last time that once more would mean the push. ” “ Then we must n't dream of yelling , ” said Sally , decidedly . “ It means a pretty long wait , you know . As far as I can gather , there 's just a chance of somebody else coming in later , in which case he could let us out . But it 's doubtful . He rather thinks that everybody has gone to roost. ” “ Well , we must try it . I would n't think of losing the poor man his job . Tell him to take the car down to the ground-floor , and then we 'll just sit and amuse ourselves till something happens . We 've lots to talk about . We can tell each other the story of our lives. ” Jules , cheered by his victims ' kindly forbearance , lowered the car to the ground floor , where , after a glance of infinite longing at the keys on the distant desk , the sort of glance which Moses must have cast at the Promised Land from the summit of Mount Pisgah , he sagged down in a heap and resumed his slumbers . Sally settled herself as comfortably as possible in her corner . “ You 'd better smoke , ” she said . “ It will be something to do. ” “ Thanks awfully. ” “ And now , ” said Sally , “ tell me why Scrymgeour fired you. ” Little by little , under the stimulating influence of this nocturnal adventure , the red-haired young man had lost that shy confusion which had rendered him so ill at ease when he had encountered Sally in the hall of the hotel ; but at this question embarrassment gripped him once more . Another of those comprehensive blushes of his raced over his face , and he stammered . “ I say , I 'm glad ... I 'm fearfully sorry about that , you know ! ” “ About Scrymgeour ? ” “ You know what I mean . I mean , about making such a most ghastly ass of myself this morning . I ... I never dreamed you understood English. ” “ Why , I did n't object . I thought you were very nice and complimentary . Of course , I do n't know how many girls you 've seen in your life , but ... ” “ No , I say , do n't ! It makes me feel such a chump. ” “ And I 'm sorry about my mouth . It is wide . But I know you 're a fair-minded man and realize that it is n't my fault. ” “ Do n't rub it in , ” pleaded the young man . “ As a matter of fact , if you want to know , I think your mouth is absolutely perfect . I think , ” he proceeded , a little feverishly , “ that you are the most indescribable topper that ever ... ” “ You were going to tell me about Scrymgeour , ” said Sally . The young man blinked as if he had collided with some hard object while sleep-walking . Eloquence had carried him away . “ Scrymgeour ? ” he said . “ Oh , that would bore you. ” “ Do n't be silly , ” said Sally reprovingly . “ Ca n't you realize that we're practically castaways on a desert island ? There 's nothing to do till to-morrow but talk about ourselves . I want to hear all about you , and then I 'll tell you all about myself . If you feel diffident about starting the revelations , I 'll begin . Better start with names . Mine is Sally Nicholas . What 's yours ? ” “ Mine ? Oh , ah , yes , I see what you mean. ” “ I thought you would . I put it as clearly as I could . Well , what is it ? ” “ Kemp. ” “ And the first name ? ” “ Well , as a matter of fact , ” said the young man , “ I 've always rather hushed up my first name , because when I was christened they worked a low-down trick on me ! ” “ You ca n't shock me , ” said Sally , encouragingly . “ My father 's name was Ezekiel , and I 've a brother who was christened Fillmore. ” Mr. Kemp brightened . “ Well , mine is n't as bad as that ... No , I don't mean that , ” he broke off apologetically . “ Both awfully jolly names , of course ... ” “ Get on , ” said Sally . “ Well , they called me Lancelot . And , of course , the thing is that I do n't look like a Lancelot and never shall . My pals , ” he added in a more cheerful strain , “ call me Ginger. ” “ I do n't blame them , ” said Sally . “ Perhaps you would n't mind thinking of me as Ginger ? '' suggested the young man diffidently . “ Certainly. ” “ That 's awfully good of you. ” “ Not at all. ” Jules stirred in his sleep and grunted . No other sound came to disturb the stillness of the night . “ You were going to tell me about yourself ? ” said Mr. Lancelot ( Ginger ) Kemp . “ I 'm going to tell you all about myself , ” said Sally , “ not because I think it will interest you ... ” “ Oh , it will ! ” “ Not , I say , because I think it will interest you ... ” “ It will , really. ” Sally looked at him coldly . “ Is this a duet ? ” she inquired , “ or have I the floor ? ” “ I 'm awfully sorry. ” “ Not , I repeat for the third time , because I think It will interest you , but because if I do you wo n't have any excuse for not telling me your life-history , and you would n't believe how inquisitive I am . Well , in the first place , I live in America . I 'm over here on a holiday . And it's the first real holiday I 've had in three years -- since I left home , in fact. ” Sally paused . “ I ran away from home , ” she said . “ Good egg ! ” said Ginger Kemp . “ I beg your pardon ? ” “ I mean , quite right . I bet you were quite right. ” “ When I say home , ” Sally went on , “ it was only a sort of imitation home , you know . One of those just-as-good homes which are never as satisfactory as the real kind . My father and mother both died a good many years ago . My brother and I were dumped down on the reluctant doorstep of an uncle. ” “ Uncles , ” said Ginger Kemp , feelingly , “ are the devil . I 've got an ... but I 'm interrupting you. ” “ My uncle was our trustee . He had control of all my brother 's money and mine till I was twenty-one . My brother was to get his when he was twenty-five . My poor father trusted him blindly , and what do you think happened ? ” “ Good Lord ! The blighter embezzled the lot ? ” “ No , not a cent . Was n't it extraordinary ! Have you ever heard of a blindly trusted uncle who was perfectly honest ? Well , mine was . But the trouble was that , while an excellent man to have looking after one's money , he was n't a very lovable character . He was very hard . Hard ! He was as hard as -- well , nearly as hard as this seat . He hated poor Fill ... ” “ Phil ? ” “ I broke it to you just now that my brother 's name was Fillmore. ” “ Oh , your brother . Oh , ah , yes. ” “ He was always picking on poor Fill . And I 'm bound to say that Fill rather laid himself out as what you might call a pickee . He was always getting into trouble . One day , about three years ago , he was expelled from Harvard , and my uncle vowed he would have nothing more to do with him . So I said , if Fill left , I would leave . And , as this seemed to be my uncle 's idea of a large evening , no objection was raised , and Fill and I departed . We went to New York , and there we 've been ever since . About six months ' ago Fill passed the twenty-five mark and collected his money , and last month I marched past the given point and got mine . So it all ends happily , you see . Now tell me about yourself. ” “ But , I say , you know , dash it , you 've skipped a lot . I mean to say , you must have had an awful time in New York , did n't you ? How on earth did you get along ? ” “ Oh , we found work . My brother tried one or two things , and finally became an assistant stage-manager with some theatre people . The only thing I could do , having been raised in enervating luxury , was ballroom dancing , so I ball-room danced . I got a job at a place in Broadway called 'The Flower Garden ' as what is humorously called an 'instructress , ' as if anybody could 'instruct ' the men who came there . One was lucky if one saved one 's life and was n't quashed to death. ” “ How perfectly foul ! ” “ Oh , I do n't know . It was rather fun for a while . Still , ” said Sally , meditatively , “ I 'm not saying I could have held out much longer : I was beginning to give . I suppose I 've been trampled underfoot by more fat men than any other girl of my age in America . I do n't know why it was , but every man who came in who was a bit overweight seemed to make for me by instinct . That 's why I like to sit on the sands here and watch these Frenchmen bathing . It 's just heavenly to lie back and watch a two hundred and fifty pound man , coming along and feel that he is n't going to dance with me. ” “ But , I say ! How absolutely rotten it must have been for you ! ” “ Well , I 'll tell you one thing . It 's going to make me a very domesticated wife one of these days . You wo n't find me gadding about in gilded jazz-palaces ! For me , a little place in the country somewhere , with my knitting and an Elsie book , and bed at half-past nine ! And now tell me the story of your life . And make it long because I 'm perfectly certain there 's going to be no relief-expedition . I 'm sure the last dweller under this roof came in years ago . We shall be here till morning. ” “ I really think we had better shout , you know. ” “ And lose Jules his job ? Never ! ” “ Well , of course , I 'm sorry for poor old Jules ' troubles , but I hate to think of you having to ... ” “ Now get on with the story , ” said Sally . 6 Ginger Kemp exhibited some of the symptoms of a young bridegroom called upon at a wedding-breakfast to respond to the toast . He moved his feet restlessly and twisted his fingers . “ I hate talking about myself , you know , ” he said . “ So I supposed , ” said Sally . “ That 's why I gave you my autobiography first , to give you no chance of backing out . Do n't be such a shrinking violet . We 're all shipwrecked mariners here . I am intensely interested in your narrative . And , even if I was n't , I 'd much rather listen to it than to Jules ' snoring. ” “ He is snoring a bit , what ? Does it annoy you ? Shall I stir him ? ” “ You seem to have an extraordinary brutal streak in your nature , ” said Sally . “ You appear to think of nothing else but schemes for harassing poor Jules . Leave him alone for a second , and start telling me about yourself. ” “ Where shall I start ? ” “ Well , not with your childhood , I think . We 'll skip that. ” “ Well ... ” Ginger Kemp knitted his brow , searching for a dramatic opening . “ Well , I 'm more or less what you might call an orphan , like you . I mean to say , both my people are dead and all that sort of thing. ” “ Thanks for explaining . That has made it quite clear. ” “ I ca n't remember my mother . My father died when I was in my last year at Cambridge . I 'd been having a most awfully good time at the 'varsity , ' ” said Ginger , warming to his theme . “ Not thick , you know , but good . I 'd got my rugger and boxing blues and I 'd just been picked for scrum-half for England against the North in the first trial match , and between ourselves it really did look as if I was more or less of a snip for my international. ” Sally gazed at him wide eyed . “ Is that good or bad ? ” she asked . “ Eh ? ” “ Are you reciting a catalogue of your crimes , or do you expect me to get up and cheer ? What is a rugger blue , to start with ? ” “ Well , it 's ... it 's a rugger blue , you know. ” “ Oh , I see , ” said Sally . “ You mean a rugger blue. ” “ I mean to say , I played rugger -- footer -- that 's to say , football -- Rugby football -- for Cambridge , against Oxford . I was scrum-half. ” “ And what is a scrum-half ? ” asked Sally , patiently . “ Yes , I know you're going to say it 's a scrum-half , but ca n't you make it easier ? ” “ The scrum-half , ” said Ginger , “ is the half who works the scrum . He slings the pill out to the fly-half , who starts the three-quarters going . I do n't know if you understand ? ” “ I don't. ” “ It 's dashed hard to explain , ” said Ginger Kemp , unhappily . “ I mean , I do n't think I 've ever met anyone before who did n't know what a scrum-half was. ” “ Well , I can see that it has something to do with football , so we'll leave it at that . I suppose it 's something like our quarter-back . And what 's an international ? ” “ It 's called getting your international when you play for England , you know . England plays Wales , France , Ireland , and Scotland . If it hadn't been for the smash , I think I should have played for England against Wales. ” “ I see at last . What you 're trying to tell me is that you were very good at football. ” Ginger Kemp blushed warmly . “ Oh , I do n't say that . England was pretty short of scrum-halves that year. ” “ What a horrible thing to happen to a country ! Still , you were likely to be picked on the All-England team when the smash came ? What was the smash ? ” “ Well , it turned out that the poor old pater had n't left a penny . I never understood the process exactly , but I 'd always supposed that we were pretty well off ; and then it turned out that I had n't anything at all . I 'm bound to say it was a bit of a jar . I had to come down from Cambridge and go to work in my uncle 's office . Of course , I made an absolute hash of it. ” “ Why , of course ? ” “ Well , I 'm not a very clever sort of chap , you see . I somehow didn't seem able to grasp the workings . After about a year , my uncle , getting a bit fed-up , hoofed me out and got me a mastership at a school , and I made a hash of that . He got me one or two other jobs , and I made a hash of those. ” “ You certainly do seem to be one of our most prominent young hashers ! ” gasped Sally . “ I am , ” said Ginger , modestly . There was a silence . “ And what about Scrymgeour ? ” Sally asked . “ That was the last of the jobs , ” said Ginger . “ Scrymgeour is a pompous old ass who thinks he 's going to be Prime Minister some day . He 's a big bug at the Bar and has just got into Parliament . My cousin used to devil for him . That 's how I got mixed up with the blighter. ” “ Your cousin used ... ? I wish you would talk English. ” “ That was my cousin who was with me on the beach this morning. ” “ And what did you say he used to do for Mr. Scrymgeour ? ” “ Oh , it 's called devilling . My cousin 's at the Bar , too -- one of our rising nibs , as a matter of fact ... ” “ I thought he was a lawyer of some kind. ” “ He 's got a long way beyond it now , but when he started he used to devil for Scrymgeour -- assist him , do n't you know . His name 's Carmyle , you know . Perhaps you 've heard of him ? He 's rather a prominent johnny in his way . Bruce Carmyle , you know. ” “ I haven't. ” “ Well , he got me this job of secretary to Scrymgeour. ” “ And why did Mr. Scrymgeour fire you ? ” Ginger Kemp 's face darkened . He frowned . Sally , watching him , felt that she had been right when she had guessed that he had a temper . She liked him none the worse for it . Mild men did not appeal to her . “ I do n't know if you 're fond of dogs ? ” said Ginger . “ I used to be before this morning , ” said Sally . “ And I suppose I shall be again in time . For the moment I 've had what you might call rather a surfeit of dogs . But are n't you straying from the point ? I asked you why Mr. Scrymgeour dismissed you. ” “ I 'm telling you. ” “ I 'm glad of that . I did n't know. ” “ The old brute , ” said Ginger , frowning again , “ has a dog . A very jolly little spaniel . Great pal of mine . And Scrymgeour is the sort of fool who ought n't to be allowed to own a dog . He 's one of those asses who is n't fit to own a dog . As a matter of fact , of all the blighted , pompous , bullying , shrivelled-souled old devils ... ” “ One moment , ” said Sally . “ I 'm getting an impression that you do n't like Mr. Scrymgeour . Am I right ? ” “ Yes ! ” “ I thought so . Womanly intuition ! Go on. ” “ He used to insist on the poor animal doing tricks . I hate seeing a dog do tricks . Dogs loathe it , you know . They 're frightfully sensitive . Well , Scrymgeour used to make this spaniel of his do tricks -- fool-things that no self-respecting dogs would do : and eventually poor old Billy got fed up and jibbed . He was too polite to bite , but he sort of shook his head and crawled under a chair . You 'd have thought anyone would have let it go at that , but would old Scrymgeour ? Not a bit of it ! Of all the poisonous ... ” “ Yes , I know . Go on. ” “ Well , the thing ended in the blighter hauling him out from under the chair and getting more and more shirty , until finally he laid into him with a stick . That is to say , ” said Ginger , coldly accurate , “ he started laying into him with a stick. ” He brooded for a moment with knit brows . “ A spaniel , mind you ! Can you imagine anyone beating a spaniel ? It's like hitting a little girl . Well , he 's a fairly oldish man , you know , and that hampered me a bit : but I got hold of the stick and broke it into about eleven pieces , and by great good luck it was a stick he happened to value rather highly . It had a gold knob and had been presented to him by his constituents or something . I minced it up a goodish bit , and then I told him a fair amount about himself . And then -- well , after that he shot me out , and I came here. ” Sally did not speak for a moment . “ You were quite right , ” she said at last , in a sober voice that had nothing in it of her customary flippancy . She paused again . “ And what are you going to do now ? ” she said . “ I do n't know. ” “ You 'll get something ? ” “ Oh , yes , I shall get something , I suppose . The family will be pretty sick , of course. ” “ For goodness ' sake ! Why do you bother about the family ? ” Sally burst out . She could not reconcile this young man 's flabby dependence on his family with the enterprise and vigour which he had shown in his dealings with the unspeakable Scrymgeour . Of course , he had been brought up to look on himself as a rich man 's son and appeared to have drifted as such young men are wont to do ; but even so ... “ The whole trouble with you , ” she said , embarking on a subject on which she held strong views , “ is that ... ” Her harangue was interrupted by what -- at the Normandie , at one o'clock in the morning -- practically amounted to a miracle . The front door of the hotel opened , and there entered a young man in evening dress . Such persons were sufficiently rare at the Normandie , which catered principally for the staid and middle-aged , and this youth 's presence was due , if one must pause to explain it , to the fact that , in the middle of his stay at Roville , a disastrous evening at the Casino had so diminished his funds that he had been obliged to make a hurried shift from the Hotel Splendide to the humbler Normandie . His late appearance to-night was caused by the fact that he had been attending a dance at the Splendide , principally in the hope of finding there some kind-hearted friend of his prosperity from whom he might borrow . A rapid-fire dialogue having taken place between Jules and the newcomer , the keys were handed through the cage , the door opened and the lift was set once more in motion . And a few minutes later , Sally , suddenly aware of an overpowering sleepiness , had switched off her light and jumped into bed . Her last waking thought was a regret that she had not been able to speak at length to Mr. Ginger Kemp on the subject of enterprise , and resolve that the address should be delivered at the earliest opportunity . CHAPTER III . THE DIGNIFIED MR. CARMYLE 1 By six o'clock on the following evening , however , Sally had been forced to the conclusion that Ginger would have to struggle through life as best he could without the assistance of her contemplated remarks : for she had seen nothing of him all day and in another hour she would have left Roville on the seven-fifteen express which was to take her to Paris , en route for Cherbourg and the liner whereon she had booked her passage for New York . It was in the faint hope of finding him even now that , at half-past six , having conveyed her baggage to the station and left it in charge of an amiable porter , she paid a last visit to the Casino Municipale . She disliked the thought of leaving Ginger without having uplifted him . Like so many alert and active-minded girls , she possessed in a great degree the quality of interesting herself in -- or , as her brother Fillmore preferred to put it , messing about with -- the private affairs of others . Ginger had impressed her as a man to whom it was worth while to give a friendly shove on the right path ; and it was with much gratification , therefore , that , having entered the Casino , she perceived a flaming head shining through the crowd which had gathered at one of the roulette-tables . There are two Casinos at Roville-sur-Mer . The one on the Promenade goes in mostly for sea-air and a mild game called boule . It is the big Casino Municipale down in the Palace Massena near the railway station which is the haunt of the earnest gambler who means business ; and it was plain to Sally directly she arrived that Ginger Kemp not only meant business but was getting results . Ginger was going extremely strong . He was entrenched behind an opulent-looking mound of square counters : and , even as Sally looked , a wooden-faced croupier shoved a further instalment across the table to him at the end of his long rake . “ Epatant ! ” murmured a wistful man at Sally 's side , removing an elbow from her ribs in order the better to gesticulate . Sally , though no French scholar , gathered that he was startled and gratified . The entire crowd seemed to be startled and gratified . There is undoubtedly a certain altruism in the make-up of the spectators at a Continental roulette-table . They seem to derive a spiritual pleasure from seeing somebody else win . The croupier gave his moustache a twist with his left hand and the wheel a twist with his right , and silence fell again . Sally , who had shifted to a spot where the pressure of the crowd was less acute , was now able to see Ginger 's face , and as she saw it she gave an involuntary laugh . He looked exactly like a dog at a rat-hole . His hair seemed to bristle with excitement . One could almost fancy that his ears were pricked up . In the tense hush which had fallen on the crowd at the restarting of the wheel , Sally 's laugh rang out with an embarrassing clearness . It had a marked effect on all those within hearing . There is something almost of religious ecstasy in the deportment of the spectators at a table where anyone is having a run of luck at roulette , and if she had guffawed in a cathedral she could not have caused a more pained consternation . The earnest worshippers gazed at her with shocked eyes , and Ginger , turning with a start , saw her and jumped up . As he did so , the ball fell with a rattling click into a red compartment of the wheel ; and , as it ceased to revolve and it was seen that at last the big winner had picked the wrong colour , a shuddering groan ran through the congregation like that which convulses the penitents ' bench at a negro revival meeting . More glances of reproach were cast at Sally . It was generally felt that her injudicious behaviour had changed Ginger 's luck . The only person who did not appear to be concerned was Ginger himself . He gathered up his loot , thrust it into his pocket , and elbowed his way to where Sally stood , now definitely established in the eyes of the crowd as a pariah . There was universal regret that he had decided to call it a day . It was to the spectators as though a star had suddenly walked off the stage in the middle of his big scene ; and not even a loud and violent quarrel which sprang up at this moment between two excitable gamblers over a disputed five-franc counter could wholly console them . “ I say , ” said Ginger , dexterously plucking Sally out of the crowd , “ this is topping , meeting you like this . I 've been looking for you everywhere. ” “ It 's funny you did n't find me , then , for that 's where I 've been . I was looking for you. ” “ No , really ? ” Ginger seemed pleased . He led the way to the quiet ante-room outside the gambling-hall , and they sat down in a corner . It was pleasant here , with nobody near except the gorgeously uniformed attendant over by the door . “ That was awfully good of you. ” “ I felt I must have a talk with you before my train went. ” Ginger started violently . “ Your train ? What do you mean ? ” “ The puff-puff , ” explained Sally . “ I 'm leaving to-night , you know. ” “ Leaving ? ” Ginger looked as horrified as the devoutest of the congregation of which Sally had just ceased to be a member . “ You don't mean leaving ? You 're not going away from Roville ? ” “ I 'm afraid so. ” “ But why ? Where are you going ? ” “ Back to America . My boat sails from Cherbourg tomorrow. ” “ Oh , my aunt ! ” “ I 'm sorry , ” said Sally , touched by his concern . She was a warm-hearted girl and liked being appreciated . “ But ... ” “ I say ... ” Ginger Kemp turned bright scarlet and glared before him at the uniformed official , who was regarding their tête-à-tête with the indulgent eye of one who has been through this sort of thing himself . “ I say , look here , will you marry me ? ” 2 Sally stared at his vermilion profile in frank amazement . Ginger , she had realized by this time , was in many ways a surprising young man , but she had not expected him to be as surprising as this . “ Marry you ! ” “ You know what I mean. ” “ Well , yes , I suppose I do . You allude to the holy state . Yes , I know what you mean. ” “ Then how about it ? ” Sally began to regain her composure . Her sense of humour was tickled . She looked at Ginger gravely . He did not meet her eye , but continued to drink in the uniformed official , who was by now so carried away by the romance of it all that he had begun to hum a love-ballad under his breath . The official could not hear what they were saying , and would not have been able to understand it even if he could have heard ; but he was an expert in the language of the eyes . “ But is n't this -- do n't think I am trying to make difficulties -- isn't this a little sudden ? ” “ It 's got to be sudden , ” said Ginger Kemp , complainingly . “ I thought you were going to be here for weeks. ” “ But , my infant , my babe , has it occurred to you that we are practically strangers ? ” She patted his hand tolerantly , causing the uniformed official to heave a tender sigh . “ I see what has happened , ” she said . “ You 're mistaking me for some other girl , some girl you know really well , and were properly introduced to . Take a good look at me , and you 'll see. ” “ If I take a good look at you , ” said Ginger , feverishly , “ I 'm dashed if I 'll answer for the consequences. ” “ And this is the man I was going to lecture on 'Enterprise . ' ” “ You 're the most wonderful girl I 've ever met , dash it ! ” said Ginger , his gaze still riveted on the official by the door “ I dare say it is sudden . I ca n't help that . I fell in love with you the moment I saw you , and there you are ! ” “ But ... ” “ Now , look here , I know I 'm not much of a chap and all that , but ... well , I 've just won the deuce of a lot of money in there ... ” “ Would you buy me with your gold ? ” “ I mean to say , we should have enough to start on , and ... of course I've made an infernal hash of everything I 've tried up till now , but there must be something I can do , and you can jolly well bet I 'd have a goodish stab at it . I mean to say , with you to buck me up and so forth , do n't you know . Well , I mean ... ” “ Has it struck you that I may already be engaged to someone else ? ” “ Oh , golly ! Are you ? ” For the first time he turned and faced her , and there was a look in his eyes which touched Sally and drove all sense of the ludicrous out of her . Absurd as it was , this man was really serious . “ Well , yes , as a matter of fact I am , ” she said soberly . Ginger Kemp bit his lip and for a moment was silent . “ Oh , well , that 's torn it ! ” he said at last . Sally was aware of an emotion too complex to analyse . There was pity in it , but amusement too . The emotion , though she did not recognize it , was maternal . Mothers , listening to their children pleading with engaging absurdity for something wholly out of their power to bestow , feel that same wavering between tears and laughter . Sally wanted to pick Ginger up and kiss him . The one thing she could not do was to look on him , sorry as she was for him , as a reasonable , grown-up man . “ You do n't really mean it , you know. ” “ Do n't I ! ” said Ginger , hollowly . “ Oh , do n't I ! ” “ You ca n't ! There is n't such a thing in real life as love at first sight . Love 's a thing that comes when you know a person well and ... ” She paused . It had just occurred to her that she was hardly the girl to lecture in this strain . Her love for Gerald Foster had been sufficiently sudden , even instantaneous . What did she know of Gerald except that she loved him ? They had become engaged within two weeks of their first meeting . She found this recollection damping to her eloquence , and ended by saying tamely : “ It 's ridiculous. ” Ginger had simmered down to a mood of melancholy resignation . “ I could n't have expected you to care for me , I suppose , anyway , ” he said , sombrely . “ I 'm not much of a chap. ” It was just the diversion from the theme under discussion which Sally had been longing to find . She welcomed the chance of continuing the conversation on a less intimate and sentimental note . “ That 's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about , ” she said , seizing the opportunity offered by this display of humility . “ I 've been looking for you all day to go on with what I was starting to say in the lift last night when we were interrupted . Do you mind if I talk to you like an aunt -- or a sister , suppose we say ? Really , the best plan would be for you to adopt me as an honorary sister . What do you think ? ” Ginger did not appear noticeably elated at the suggested relationship . “ Because I really do take a tremendous interest in you. ” Ginger brightened . “ That 's awfully good of you. ” “ I 'm going to speak words of wisdom . Ginger , why do n't you brace up ? ” “ Brace up ? ” “ Yes , stiffen your backbone and stick out your chin , and square your elbows , and really amount to something . Why do you simply flop about and do nothing and leave everything to what you call 'the family ' ? Why do you have to be helped all the time ? Why do n't you help yourself ? Why do you have to have jobs found for you ? Why do n't you rush out and get one ? Why do you have to worry about what , 'the family ' thinks of you ? Why do n't you make yourself independent of them ? I know you had hard luck , suddenly finding yourself without money and all that , but , good heavens , everybody else in the world who has ever done anything has been broke at one time or another . It 's part of the fun . You 'll never get anywhere by letting yourself be picked up by the family like ... like a floppy Newfoundland puppy and dumped down in any old place that happens to suit them . A job 's a thing you 've got to choose for yourself and get for yourself . Think what you can do -- there must be something -- and then go at it with a snort and grab it and hold it down and teach it to take a joke . You 've managed to collect some money . It will give you time to look round . And , when you 've had a look round , do something ! Try to realize you 're alive , and try to imagine the family is n't ! ” Sally stopped and drew a deep breath . Ginger Kemp did not reply for a moment . He seemed greatly impressed . “ When you talk quick , ” he said at length , in a serious meditative voice , “ your nose sort of goes all squiggly . Ripping , it looks ! ” Sally uttered an indignant cry . “ Do you mean to say you have n't been listening to a word I 've been saying , ” she demanded . “ Oh , rather ! Oh , by Jove , yes. ” “ Well , what did I say ? ” “ You ... er ... And your eyes sort of shine , too. ” “ Never mind my eyes . What did I say ? ” “ You told me , ” said Ginger , on reflection , “ to get a job. ” “ Well , yes . I put it much better than that , but that 's what it amounted to , I suppose . All right , then . I 'm glad you ... ” Ginger was eyeing her with mournful devotion . “ I say , ” he interrupted , “ I wish you 'd let me write to you . Letters , I mean , and all that . I have an idea it would kind of buck me up. ” “ You wo n't have time for writing letters. ” “ I 'll have time to write them to you . You have n't an address or anything of that sort in America , have you , by any chance ? I mean , so that I'd know where to write to. ” “ I can give you an address which will always find me. ” She told him the number and street of Mrs. Meecher 's boarding-house , and he wrote them down reverently on his shirt-cuff . “ Yes , on second thoughts , do write , ” she said . “ Of course , I shall want to know how you 've got on . I ... oh , my goodness ! That clock 's not right ? ” “ Just about . What time does your train go ? ” “ Go ! It 's gone ! Or , at least , it goes in about two seconds. ” She made a rush for the swing-door , to the confusion of the uniformed official who had not been expecting this sudden activity . “ Good-bye , Ginger . Write to me , and remember what I said. ” Ginger , alert after his unexpected fashion when it became a question of physical action , had followed her through the swing-door , and they emerged together and started running down the square . “ Stick it ! ” said Ginger , encouragingly . He was running easily and well , as becomes a man who , in his day , had been a snip for his international at scrum-half . Sally saved her breath . The train was beginning to move slowly out of the station as they sprinted abreast on to the platform . Ginger dived for the nearest door , wrenched it open , gathered Sally neatly in his arms , and flung her in . She landed squarely on the toes of a man who occupied the corner seat , and , bounding off again , made for the window . Ginger , faithful to the last , was trotting beside the train as it gathered speed . “ Ginger ! My poor porter ! Tip him . I forgot. ” “ Right ho ! ” “ And do n't forget what I 've been saying. ” “ Right ho ! ” “ Look after yourself and 'Death to the Family ! ' ” “ Right ho ! ” The train passed smoothly out of the station . Sally cast one last look back at her red-haired friend , who had now halted and was waving a handkerchief . Then she turned to apologize to the other occupant of the carriage . “ I 'm so sorry , ” she said , breathlessly . “ I hope I did n't hurt you. ” She found herself facing Ginger 's cousin , the dark man of yesterday's episode on the beach , Bruce Carmyle . 3 Mr. Carmyle was not a man who readily allowed himself to be disturbed by life 's little surprises , but at the present moment he could not help feeling slightly dazed . He recognized Sally now as the French girl who had attracted his cousin Lancelot 's notice on the beach . At least he had assumed that she was French , and it was startling to be addressed by her now in fluent English . How had she suddenly acquired this gift of tongues ? And how on earth had she had time since yesterday , when he had been a total stranger to her , to become sufficiently intimate with Cousin Lancelot to be sprinting with him down station platforms and addressing him out of railway-carriage windows as Ginger ? Bruce Carmyle was aware that most members of that sub-species of humanity , his cousin 's personal friends , called him by that familiar -- and , so Carmyle held , vulgar -- nickname : but how had this girl got hold of it ? If Sally had been less pretty , Mr. Carmyle would undoubtedly have looked disapprovingly at her , for she had given his rather rigid sense of the proprieties a nasty jar . But as , panting and flushed from her run , she was prettier than any girl he had yet met , he contrived to smile . “ Not at all , ” he said in answer to her question , though it was far from the truth . His left big toe was aching confoundedly . Even a girl with a foot as small as Sally 's can make her presence felt on a man 's toe if the scrum-half who is handling her aims well and uses plenty of vigour . “ If you do n't mind , ” said Sally , sitting down , “ I think I 'll breathe a little. ” She breathed . The train sped on . “ Quite a close thing , ” said Bruce Carmyle , affably . The pain in his toe was diminishing . “ You nearly missed it. ” “ Yes . It was lucky Mr. Kemp was with me . He throws very straight , does n't he. ” “ Tell me , ” said Carmyle , “ how do you come to know my Cousin ? On the beach yesterday morning ... ” “ Oh , we did n't know each other then . But we were staying at the same hotel , and we spent an hour or so shut up in an elevator together . That was when we really got acquainted. ” A waiter entered the compartment , announcing in unexpected English that dinner was served in the restaurant car . “ Would you care for dinner ? ” “ I 'm starving , ” said Sally . She reproved herself , as they made their way down the corridor , for being so foolish as to judge anyone by his appearance . This man was perfectly pleasant in spite of his grim exterior . She had decided by the time they had seated themselves at the table she liked him . At the table , however , Mr. Carmyle 's manner changed for the worse . He lost his amiability . He was evidently a man who took his meals seriously and believed in treating waiters with severity . He shuddered austerely at a stain on the table-cloth , and then concentrated himself frowningly on the bill of fare . Sally , meanwhile , was establishing cosy relations with the much too friendly waiter , a cheerful old man who from the start seemed to have made up his mind to regard her as a favourite daughter . The waiter talked no English and Sally no French , but they were getting along capitally , when Mr. Carmyle , who had been irritably waving aside the servitor 's light-hearted advice -- at the Hotel Splendide the waiters never bent over you and breathed cordial suggestions down the side of your face -- gave his order crisply in the Anglo-Gallic dialect of the travelling Briton . The waiter remarked , “ Boum ! ” in a pleased sort of way , and vanished . “ Nice old man ! ” said Sally . “ Infernally familiar ! ” said Mr. Carmyle . Sally perceived that on the topic of the waiter she and her host did not see eye to eye and that little pleasure or profit could be derived from any discussion centring about him . She changed the subject . She was not liking Mr. Carmyle quite so much as she had done a few minutes ago , but it was courteous of him to give her dinner , and she tried to like him as much as she could . “ By the way , ” she said , “ my name is Nicholas . I always think it 's a good thing to start with names , do n't you ? ” “ Mine ... ” “ Oh , I know yours . Ginger -- Mr. Kemp told me. ” Mr. Carmyle , who since the waiter 's departure , had been thawing , stiffened again at the mention of Ginger . “ Indeed ? ” he said , coldly . “ Apparently you got intimate. ” Sally did not like his tone . He seemed to be criticizing her , and she resented criticism from a stranger . Her eyes opened wide and she looked dangerously across the table . “ Why 'apparently ' ? I told you that we had got intimate , and I explained how . You ca n't stay shut up in an elevator half the night with anybody without getting to know him . I found Mr. Kemp very pleasant. ” “ Really ? ” “ And very interesting. ” Mr. Carmyle raised his eyebrows . “ Would you call him interesting ? ” “ I did call him interesting. ” Sally was beginning to feel the exhilaration of battle . Men usually made themselves extremely agreeable to her , and she reacted belligerently under the stiff unfriendliness which had come over her companion in the last few minutes . “ He told me all about himself. ” “ And you found that interesting ? ” “ Why not ? ” “ Well ... ” A frigid half-smile came and went on Bruce Carmyle 's dark face . “ My cousin has many excellent qualities , no doubt -- he used to play football well , and I understand that he is a capable amateur pugilist -- but I should not have supposed him entertaining . We find him a little dull. ” “ I thought it was only royalty that called themselves 'we . ' ” “ I meant myself -- and the rest of the family. ” The mention of the family was too much for Sally . She had to stop talking in order to allow her mind to clear itself of rude thoughts . “ Mr . Kemp was telling me about Mr. Scrymgeour , ” she went on at length . Bruce Carmyle stared for a moment at the yard or so of French bread which the waiter had placed on the table . “ Indeed ? ” he said . “ He has an engaging lack of reticence. ” The waiter returned bearing soup and dumped it down . “ V'la ! ” he observed , with the satisfied air of a man who has successfully performed a difficult conjuring trick . He smiled at Sally expectantly , as though confident of applause from this section of his audience at least . But Sally 's face was set and rigid . She had been snubbed , and the sensation was as pleasant as it was novel . “ I think Mr. Kemp had hard luck , ” she said . “ If you will excuse me , I would prefer not to discuss the matter. ” Mr. Carmyle 's attitude was that Sally might be a pretty girl , but she was a stranger , and the intimate affairs of the Family were not to be discussed with strangers , however prepossessing . “ He was quite in the right . Mr. Scrymgeour was beating a dog ... ” “ I 've heard the details. ” “ Oh , I did n't know that . Well , do n't you agree with me , then ? ” “ I do not . A man who would throw away an excellent position simply because ... ” “ Oh , well , if that 's your view , I suppose it is useless to talk about it. ” “ Quite. ” “ Still , there 's no harm in asking what you propose to do about Gin -- about Mr. Kemp. ” Mr. Carmyle became more glacial . “ I 'm afraid I can not discuss ... ” Sally 's quick impatience , nobly restrained till now , finally got the better of her . “ Oh , for goodness ' sake , ” she snapped , “ do try to be human , and don't always be snubbing people . You remind me of one of those portraits of men in the eighteenth century , with wooden faces , who look out of heavy gold frames at you with fishy eyes as if you were a regrettable incident. ” “ Rosbif , ” said the waiter genially , manifesting himself suddenly beside them as if he had popped up out of a trap . Bruce Carmyle attacked his roast beef morosely . Sally who was in the mood when she knew that she would be ashamed of herself later on , but was full of battle at the moment , sat in silence . “ I am sorry , ” said Mr. Carmyle ponderously , “ if my eyes are fishy . The fact has not been called to my attention before. ” “ I suppose you never had any sisters , ” said Sally . “ They would have told you. ” Mr. Carmyle relapsed into an offended dumbness , which lasted till the waiter had brought the coffee . “ I think , ” said Sally , getting up , “ I 'll be going now . I do n't seem to want any coffee , and , if I stay on , I may say something rude . I thought I might be able to put in a good word for Mr. Kemp and save him from being massacred , but apparently it 's no use . Good-bye , Mr. Carmyle , and thank you for giving me dinner. ” She made her way down the car , followed by Bruce Carmyle 's indignant , yet fascinated , gaze . Strange emotions were stirring in Mr. Carmyle's bosom . CHAPTER IV . GINGER IN DANGEROUS MOOD Some few days later , owing to the fact that the latter , being preoccupied , did not see him first , Bruce Carmyle met his cousin Lancelot in Piccadilly . They had returned by different routes from Roville , and Ginger would have preferred the separation to continue . He was hurrying on with a nod , when Carmyle stopped him . “ Just the man I wanted to see , ” he observed . “ Oh , hullo ! ” said Ginger , without joy . “ I was thinking of calling at your club. ” “ Yes ? ” “ Yes . Cigarette ? ” Ginger peered at the proffered case with the vague suspicion of the man who has allowed himself to be lured on to the platform and is accepting a card from the conjurer . He felt bewildered . In all the years of their acquaintance he could not recall another such exhibition of geniality on his cousin 's part . He was surprised , indeed , at Mr. Carmyle 's speaking to him at all , for the affaire Scrymgeour remained an un-healed wound , and the Family , Ginger knew , were even now in session upon it . “ Been back in London long ? ” “ Day or two. ” “ I heard quite by accident that you had returned and that you were staying at the club . By the way , thank you for introducing me to Miss Nicholas. ” Ginger started violently . “ What ! ” “ I was in that compartment , you know , at Roville Station . You threw her right on top of me . We agreed to consider that an introduction . An attractive girl. ” Bruce Carmyle had not entirely made up his mind regarding Sally , but on one point he was clear , that she should not , if he could help it , pass out of his life . Her abrupt departure had left him with that baffled and dissatisfied feeling which , though it has little in common with love at first sight , frequently produces the same effects . She had had , he could not disguise it from himself , the better of their late encounter and he was conscious of a desire to meet her again and show her that there was more in him than she apparently supposed . Bruce Carmyle , in a word , was piqued : and , though he could not quite decide whether he liked or disliked Sally , he was very sure that a future without her would have an element of flatness . “ A very attractive girl . We had a very pleasant talk. ” “ I bet you did , ” said Ginger enviously . “ By the way , she did not give you her address by any chance ? ” “ Why ? ” said Ginger suspiciously . His attitude towards Sally 's address resembled somewhat that of a connoisseur who has acquired a unique work of art . He wanted to keep it to himself and gloat over it . “ Well , I -- er -- I promised to send her some books she was anxious to read ... ” “ I should n't think she gets much time for reading. ” “ Books which are not published in America. ” “ Oh , pretty nearly everything is published in America , what ? Bound to be , I mean. ” “ Well , these particular books are not , ” said Mr. Carmyle shortly . He was finding Ginger 's reserve a little trying , and wished that he had been more inventive . “ Give them to me and I 'll send them to her , ” suggested Ginger . “ Good Lord , man ! ” snapped Mr. Carmyle . “ I 'm capable of sending a few books to America . Where does she live ? ” Ginger revealed the sacred number of the holy street which had the luck to be Sally 's headquarters . He did it because with a persistent devil like his cousin there seemed no way of getting out of it : but he did it grudgingly . “ Thanks. ” Bruce Carmyle wrote the information down with a gold pencil in a dapper little morocco-bound note-book . He was the sort of man who always has a pencil , and the backs of old envelopes never enter into his life . There was a pause . Bruce Carmyle coughed . “ I saw Uncle Donald this morning , ” he said . His manner had lost its geniality . There was no need for it now , and he was a man who objected to waste . He spoke coldly , and in his voice there was a familiar sub-tingle of reproof . “ Yes ? ” said Ginger moodily . This was the uncle in whose office he had made his debut as a hasher : a worthy man , highly respected in the National Liberal Club , but never a favourite of Ginger 's . There were other minor uncles and a few subsidiary aunts who went to make up the Family , but Uncle Donald was unquestionably the managing director of that body and it was Ginger 's considered opinion that in this capacity he approximated to a human blister . “ He wants you to dine with him to-night at Bleke's. ” Ginger 's depression deepened . A dinner with Uncle Donald would hardly have been a cheerful function , even in the surroundings of a banquet in the Arabian Nights . There was that about Uncle Donald 's personality which would have cast a sobering influence over the orgies of the Emperor Tiberius at Capri . To dine with him at a morgue like that relic of Old London , Bleke 's Coffee House , which confined its custom principally to regular patrons who had not missed an evening there for half a century , was to touch something very near bed-rock . Ginger was extremely doubtful whether flesh and blood were equal to it . “ To-night ? ” he said . “ Oh , you mean to-night ? Well ... ” “ Do n't be a fool . You know as well as I do that you 've got to go. ” Uncle Donald 's invitations were royal commands in the Family . “ If you've another engagement you must put it off. ” “ Oh , all right. ” “ Seven-thirty sharp. ” “ All right , ” said Ginger gloomily . The two men went their ways , Bruce Carmyle eastwards because he had clients to see in his chambers at the Temple ; Ginger westwards because Mr. Carmyle had gone east . There was little sympathy between these cousins : yet , oddly enough , their thoughts as they walked centred on the same object . Bruce Carmyle , threading his way briskly through the crowds of Piccadilly Circus , was thinking of Sally : and so was Ginger as he loafed aimlessly towards Hyde Park Corner , bumping in a sort of coma from pedestrian to pedestrian . Since his return to London Ginger had been in bad shape . He mooned through the days and slept poorly at night . If there is one thing rottener than another in a pretty blighted world , one thing which gives a fellow the pip and reduces him to the condition of an absolute onion , it is hopeless love . Hopeless love had got Ginger all stirred up . His had been hitherto a placid soul . Even the financial crash which had so altered his life had not bruised him very deeply . His temperament had enabled him to bear the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune with a philosophic “ Right ho ! ” But now everything seemed different . Things irritated him acutely , which before he had accepted as inevitable -- his Uncle Donald 's moustache , for instance , and its owner 's habit of employing it during meals as a sort of zareba or earthwork against the assaults of soup . “ By gad ! ” thought Ginger , stopping suddenly opposite Devonshire House . “ If he uses that damned shrubbery as soup-strainer to-night , I 'll slosh him with a fork ! ” Hard thoughts ... hard thoughts ! And getting harder all the time , for nothing grows more quickly than a mood of rebellion . Rebellion is a forest fire that flames across the soul . The spark had been lighted in Ginger , and long before he reached Hyde Park Corner he was ablaze and crackling . By the time he returned to his club he was practically a menace to society -- to that section of it , at any rate , which embraced his Uncle Donald , his minor uncles George and William , and his aunts Mary , Geraldine , and Louise . Nor had the mood passed when he began to dress for the dismal festivities of Bleke 's Coffee House . He scowled as he struggled morosely with an obstinate tie . One can not disguise the fact -- Ginger was warming up . And it was just at this moment that Fate , as though it had been waiting for the psychological instant , applied the finishing touch . There was a knock at the door , and a waiter came in with a telegram . Ginger looked at the envelope . It had been readdressed and forwarded on from the Hotel Normandie . It was a wireless , handed in on board the White Star liner Olympic , and it ran as follows : Remember . Death to the Family . S. Ginger sat down heavily on the bed . The driver of the taxi-cab which at twenty-five minutes past seven drew up at the dingy door of Bleke 's Coffee House in the Strand was rather struck by his fare 's manner and appearance . A determined-looking sort of young bloke , was the taxi-driver 's verdict . CHAPTER V. SALLY HEARS NEWS It had been Sally 's intention , on arriving in New York , to take a room at the St. Regis and revel in the gilded luxury to which her wealth entitled her before moving into the small but comfortable apartment which , as soon as she had the time , she intended to find and make her permanent abode . But when the moment came and she was giving directions to the taxi-driver at the dock , there seemed to her something revoltingly Fillmorian about the scheme . It would be time enough to sever herself from the boarding-house which had been her home for three years when she had found the apartment . Meanwhile , the decent thing to do , if she did not want to brand herself in the sight of her conscience as a female Fillmore , was to go back temporarily to Mrs. Meecher's admirable establishment and foregather with her old friends . After all , home is where the heart is , even if there are more prunes there than the gourmet would consider judicious . Perhaps it was the unavoidable complacency induced by the thought that she was doing the right thing , or possibly it was the tingling expectation of meeting Gerald Foster again after all these weeks of separation , that made the familiar streets seem wonderfully bright as she drove through them . It was a perfect , crisp New York morning , all blue sky and amber sunshine , and even the ash-cans had a stimulating look about them . The street cars were full of happy people rollicking off to work : policemen directed the traffic with jaunty affability : and the white-clad street-cleaners went about their poetic tasks with a quiet but none the less noticeable relish . It was improbable that any of these people knew that she was back , but somehow they all seemed to be behaving as though this were a special day . The first discordant note in this overture of happiness was struck by Mrs. Meecher , who informed Sally , after expressing her gratification at the news that she required her old room , that Gerald Foster had left town that morning . “ Gone to Detroit , he has , ” said Mrs. Meecher . “ Miss Doland , too. ” She broke off to speak a caustic word to the boarding-house handyman , who , with Sally 's trunk as a weapon , was depreciating the value of the wall-paper in the hall . “ There 's that play of his being tried out there , you know , Monday , ” resumed Mrs. Meecher , after the handyman had bumped his way up the staircase . “ They been rehearsing ever since you left. ” Sally was disappointed , but it was such a beautiful morning , and New York was so wonderful after the dull voyage in the liner that she was not going to allow herself to be depressed without good reason . After all , she could go on to Detroit tomorrow . It was nice to have something to which she could look forward . “ Oh , is Elsa in the company ? ” she said . “ Sure . And very good too , I hear. ” Mrs. Meecher kept abreast of theatrical gossip . She was an ex-member of the profession herself , having been in the first production of “ Florodora , ” though , unlike everybody else , not one of the original Sextette . “ Mr . Faucitt was down to see a rehearsal , and he said Miss Doland was fine . And he 's not easy to please , as you know. ” “ How is Mr. Faucitt ? ” Mrs. Meecher , not unwillingly , for she was a woman who enjoyed the tragedies of life , made her second essay in the direction of lowering Sally 's uplifted mood . “ Poor old gentleman , he ai n't over and above well . Went to bed early last night with a headache , and this morning I been to see him and he do n't look well . There 's a lot of this Spanish influenza about . It might be that . Lots o ' people have been dying of it , if you believe what you see in the papers , ” said Mrs. Meecher buoyantly . “ Good gracious ! You do n't think ... ? ” “ Well , he ai n't turned black , ” admitted Mrs. Meecher with regret . “ They say they turn black . If you believe what you see in the papers , that is . Of course , that may come later , ” she added with the air of one confident that all will come right in the future . “ The doctor 'll be in to see him pretty soon . He 's quite happy . Toto 's sitting with him. ” Sally 's concern increased . Like everyone who had ever spent any length of time in the house , she had strong views on Toto . This quadruped , who stained the fame of the entire canine race by posing as a dog , was a small woolly animal with a persistent and penetrating yap , hard to bear with equanimity in health and certainly quite outside the range of a sick man . Her heart bled for Mr. Faucitt . Mrs. Meecher , on the other hand , who held a faith in her little pet 's amiability and power to soothe which seven years ' close association had been unable to shake , seemed to feel that , with Toto on the spot , all that could be done had been done as far as pampering the invalid was concerned . “ I must go up and see him , ” cried Sally . “ Poor old dear. ” “ Sure . You know his room . You can hear Toto talking to him now , ” said Mrs. Meecher complacently . “ He wants a cracker , that 's what he wants . Toto likes a cracker after breakfast. ” The invalid 's eyes , as Sally entered the room , turned wearily to the door . At the sight of Sally they lit up with an incredulous rapture . Almost any intervention would have pleased Mr. Faucitt at that moment , for his little playmate had long outstayed any welcome that might originally have been his : but that the caller should be his beloved Sally seemed to the old man something in the nature of a return of the age of miracles . “ Sally ! ” “ One moment . Here , Toto ! ” Toto , struck momentarily dumb by the sight of food , had jumped off the bed and was standing with his head on one side , peering questioningly at the cracker . He was a suspicious dog , but he allowed himself to be lured into the passage , upon which Sally threw the cracker down and slipped in and shut the door . Toto , after a couple of yaps , which may have been gratitude or baffled fury , trotted off downstairs , and Mr. Faucitt drew a deep breath . “ Sally , you come , as ever , as an angel of mercy . Our worthy Mrs. Meecher means well , and I yield to no man in my respect for her innate kindness of heart : but she errs in supposing that that thrice-damned whelp of hers is a combination of sick-nurse , soothing medicine , and a week at the seaside . She insisted on bringing him here . He was yapping then , as he was yapping when , with womanly resource which I can not sufficiently praise , you decoyed him hence . And each yap went through me like hammer-strokes on sheeted tin . Sally , you stand alone among womankind . You shine like a good deed in a naughty world . When did you get back ? ” “ I 've only just arrived in my hired barouche from the pier. ” “ And you came to see your old friend without delay ? I am grateful and flattered . Sally , my dear. ” “ Of course I came to see you . Do you suppose that , when Mrs. Meecher told me you were sick , I just said 'Is that so ? ' and went on talking about the weather ? Well , what do you mean by it ? Frightening everybody . Poor old darling , do you feel very bad ? ” “ One thousand individual mice are nibbling the base of my spine , and I am conscious of a constant need of cooling refreshment . But what of that ? Your presence is a tonic . Tell me , how did our Sally enjoy foreign travel ? ” “ Our Sally had the time of her life. ” “ Did you visit England ? ” “ Only passing through. ” “ How did it look ? ” asked Mr. Faucitt eagerly . “ Moist . Very moist. ” “ It would , ” said Mr. Faucitt indulgently . “ I confess that , happy as I have been in this country , there are times when I miss those wonderful London days , when a sort of cosy brown mist hangs over the streets and the pavements ooze with a perspiration of mud and water , and you see through the haze the yellow glow of the Bodega lamps shining in the distance like harbour-lights . Not , ” said Mr. Faucitt , “ that I specify the Bodega to the exclusion of other and equally worthy hostelries . I have passed just as pleasant hours in Rule 's and Short 's . You missed something by not lingering in England , Sally. ” “ I know I did -- pneumonia. ” Mr. Faucitt shook his head reproachfully . “ You are prejudiced , my dear . You would have enjoyed London if you had had the courage to brave its superficial gloom . Where did you spend your holiday ? Paris ? ” “ Part of the time . And the rest of the while I was down by the sea . It was glorious . I do n't think I would ever have come back if I had n't had to . But , of course , I wanted to see you all again . And I wanted to be at the opening of Mr. Foster 's play . Mrs. Meecher tells me you went to one of the rehearsals. ” “ I attended a dog-fight which I was informed was a rehearsal , ” said Mr. Faucitt severely . “ There is no rehearsing nowadays. ” “ Oh dear ! Was it as bad as all that ? ” “ The play is good . The play -- I will go further -- is excellent . It has fat . But the acting ... ” “ Mrs . Meecher said you told her that Elsa was good. ” “ Our worthy hostess did not misreport me . Miss Doland has great possibilities . She reminds me somewhat of Matilda Devine , under whose banner I played a season at the Old Royalty in London many years ago . She has the seeds of greatness in her , but she is wasted in the present case on an insignificant part . There is only one part in the play . I allude to the one murdered by Miss Mabel Hobson. ” “ Murdered ! ” Sally 's heart sank . She had been afraid of this , and it was no satisfaction to feel that she had warned Gerald . “ Is she very terrible ? ” “ She has the face of an angel and the histrionic ability of that curious suet pudding which our estimable Mrs. Meecher is apt to give us on Fridays . In my professional career I have seen many cases of what I may term the Lady Friend in the role of star , but Miss Hobson eclipses them all . I remember in the year '94 a certain scion of the plutocracy took it into his head to present a female for whom he had conceived an admiration in a part which would have taxed the resources of the ablest . I was engaged in her support , and at the first rehearsal I recollect saying to my dear old friend , Arthur Moseby -- dead , alas , these many years . An excellent juvenile , but , like so many good fellows , cursed with a tendency to lift the elbow -- I recollect saying to him 'Arthur , dear boy , I give it two weeks . ' 'Max , ' was his reply , 'you are an incurable optimist . One consecutive night , laddie , one consecutive night . ' We had , I recall , an even half-crown upon it . He won . We opened at Wigan , our leading lady got the bird , and the show closed next day . I was forcibly reminded of this incident as I watched Miss Hobson rehearsing. ” “ Oh , poor Ger -- poor Mr. Foster ! ” “ I do not share your commiseration for that young man , ” said Mr. Faucitt austerely . “ You probably are almost a stranger to him , but he and I have been thrown together a good deal of late . A young man upon whom , mark my words , success , if it ever comes , will have the worst effects . I dislike him . Sally . He is , I think , without exception , the most selfish and self-centred young man of my acquaintance . He reminds me very much of old Billy Fothergill , with whom I toured a good deal in the later eighties . Did I ever tell you the story of Billy and the amateur who ... ? ” Sally was in no mood to listen to the adventures of Mr. Fothergill . The old man 's innocent criticism of Gerald had stabbed her deeply . A momentary impulse to speak hotly in his defence died away as she saw Mr. Faucitt 's pale , worn old face . He had meant no harm , after all . How could he know what Gerald was to her ? She changed the conversation abruptly . “ Have you seen anything of Fillmore while I 've been away ? ” “ Fillmore ? Why yes , my dear , curiously enough I happened to run into him on Broadway only a few days ago . He seemed changed -- less stiff and aloof than he had been for some time past . I may be wronging him , but there have been times of late when one might almost have fancied him a trifle up-stage . All that was gone at our last encounter . He appeared glad to see me and was most cordial. ” Sally found her composure restored . Her lecture on the night of the party had evidently , she thought , not been wasted . Mr. Faucitt , however , advanced another theory to account for the change in the Man of Destiny . “ I rather fancy , ” he said , “ that the softening influence has been the young man 's fiancée. ” “ What ? Fillmore 's not engaged ? ” “ Did he not write and tell you ? I suppose he was waiting to inform you when you returned . Yes , Fillmore is betrothed . The lady was with him when we met . A Miss Winch . In the profession , I understand . He introduced me . A very charming and sensible young lady , I thought. ” Sally shook her head . “ She ca n't be . Fillmore would never have got engaged to anyone like that . Was her hair crimson ? ” “ Brown , if I recollect rightly. ” “ Very loud , I suppose , and overdressed ? ” “ On the contrary , neat and quiet. ” “ You 've made a mistake , ” said Sally decidedly . “ She ca n't have been like that . I shall have to look into this . It does seem hard that I ca n't go away for a few weeks without all my friends taking to beds of sickness and all my brothers getting ensnared by vampires. ” A knock at the door interrupted her complaint . Mrs. Meecher entered , ushering in a pleasant little man with spectacles and black bag . “ The doctor to see you , Mr. Faucitt. ” Mrs. Meecher cast an appraising eye at the invalid , as if to detect symptoms of approaching discoloration . “ I 've been telling him that what I think you 've gotten is this here new Spanish influenza . Two more deaths there were in the paper this morning , if you can believe what you see ... ” “ I wonder , ” said the doctor , “ if you would mind going and bringing me a small glass of water ? ” “ Why , sure. ” “ Not a large glass -- a small glass . Just let the tap run for a few moments and take care not to spill any as you come up the stairs . I always ask ladies , like our friend who has just gone , ” he added as the door closed , “ to bring me a glass of water . It keeps them amused and interested and gets them out of the way , and they think I am going to do a conjuring trick with it . As a matter of fact , I 'm going to drink it . Now let 's have a look at you. ” The examination did not take long . At the end of it the doctor seemed somewhat chagrined . “ Our good friend 's diagnosis was correct . I 'd give a leg to say it was n't , but it was . It is this here new Spanish influenza . Not a bad attack . You want to stay in bed and keep warm , and I 'll write you out a prescription . You ought to be nursed . Is this young lady a nurse ? ” “ No , no , merely ... ” “ Of course I 'm a nurse , ” said Sally decidedly . “ It is n't difficult , is it , doctor ? I know nurses smooth pillows . I can do that . Is there anything else ? ” “ Their principal duty is to sit here and prevent the excellent and garrulous lady who has just left us from getting in . They must also be able to aim straight with a book or an old shoe , if that small woolly dog I met downstairs tries to force an entrance . If you are equal to these tasks , I can leave the case in your hands with every confidence. ” “ But , Sally , my dear , ” said Mr. Faucitt , concerned , “ you must not waste your time looking after me . You have a thousand things to occupy you. ” “ There 's nothing I want to do more than help you to get better . I'll just go out and send a wire , and then I 'll be right back. ” Five minutes later , Sally was in a Western Union office , telegraphing to Gerald that she would be unable to reach Detroit in time for the opening . CHAPTER VI . FIRST AID FOR FILLMORE 1 It was not till the following Friday that Sally was able to start for Detroit . She arrived on the Saturday morning and drove to the Hotel Statler . Having ascertained that Gerald was stopping in the hotel and having 'phoned up to his room to tell him to join her , she went into the dining-room and ordered breakfast . She felt low-spirited as she waited for the food to arrive . The nursing of Mr. Faucitt had left her tired , and she had not slept well on the train . But the real cause of her depression was the fact that there had been a lack of enthusiasm in Gerald 's greeting over the telephone just now . He had spoken listlessly , as though the fact of her returning after all these weeks was a matter of no account , and she felt hurt and perplexed . A cup of coffee had a stimulating effect . Men , of course , were always like this in the early morning . It would , no doubt , be a very different Gerald who would presently bound into the dining-room , quickened and restored by a cold shower-bath . In the meantime , here was food , and she needed it . She was pouring out her second cup of coffee when a stout young man , of whom she had caught a glimpse as he moved about that section of the hotel lobby which was visible through the open door of the dining-room , came in and stood peering about as though in search of someone . The momentary sight she had had of this young man had interested Sally . She had thought how extraordinarily like he was to her brother Fillmore . Now she perceived that it was Fillmore himself . Sally was puzzled . What could Fillmore be doing so far west ? She had supposed him to be a permanent resident of New York . But , of course , your man of affairs and vast interests flits about all over the place . At any rate , here he was , and she called him . And , after he had stood in the doorway looking in every direction except the right one for another minute , he saw her and came over to her table . “ Why , Sally ? ” His manner , she thought , was nervous -- one might almost have said embarrassed . She attributed this to a guilty conscience . Presently he would have to break to her the news that he had become engaged to be married without her sisterly sanction , and no doubt he was wondering how to begin . “ What are you doing here ? I thought you were in Europe. ” “ I got back a week ago , but I 've been nursing poor old Mr. Faucitt ever since then . He 's been ill , poor old dear . I 've come here to see Mr. Foster 's play , 'The Primrose Way , ' you know . Is it a success ? ” “ It has n't opened yet. ” “ Do n't be silly , Fill . Do pull yourself together . It opened last Monday. ” “ No , it did n't . Have n't you heard ? They 've closed all the theatres because of this infernal Spanish influenza . Nothing has been playing this week . You must have seen it in the papers. ” “ I have n't had time to read the papers . Oh , Fill , what an awful shame ! ” “ Yes , it 's pretty tough . Makes the company all on edge . I 've had the darndest time , I can tell you. ” “ Why , what have you got to do with it ? ” Fillmore coughed . “ I -- er -- oh , I did n't tell you that . I 'm sort of -- er -- mixed up in the show . Cracknell -- you remember he was at college with me -- suggested that I should come down and look at it . Should n't wonder if he wants me to put money into it and so on. ” “ I thought he had all the money in the world. ” “ Yes , he has a lot , but these fellows like to let a pal in on a good thing. ” “ Is it a good thing ? ” “ The play 's fine. ” “ That 's what Mr. Faucitt said . But Mabel Hobson ... ” Fillmore 's ample face registered emotion . “ She 's an awful woman , Sally ! She ca n't act , and she throws her weight about all the time . The other day there was a fuss about a paper-knife ... ” “ How do you mean , a fuss about a paper-knife ? ” “ One of the props , you know . It got mislaid . I 'm certain it was n't my fault ... ” “ How could it have been your fault ? ” asked Sally wonderingly . Love seemed to have the worst effects on Fillmore 's mentality . “ Well -- er -- you know how it is . Angry woman ... blames the first person she sees ... This paper-knife ... ” Fillmore 's voice trailed off into pained silence . “ Mr . Faucitt said Elsa Doland was good. ” “ Oh , she 's all right , ” said Fillmore indifferently . “ But -- ” His face brightened and animation crept into his voice . “ But the girl you want to watch is Miss Winch . Gladys Winch . She plays the maid . She 's only in the first act , and has n't much to say , except 'Did you ring , madam ? ' and things like that . But it 's the way she says 'em ! Sally , that girl 's a genius ! The greatest character actress in a dozen years ! You mark my words , in a darned little while you 'll see her name up on Broadway in electric light . Personality ? Ask me ! Charm ? She wrote the words and music ! Looks ? ... ” “ All right ! All right ! I know all about it , Fill . And will you kindly inform me how you dared to get engaged without consulting me ? ” Fillmore blushed richly . “ Oh , do you know ? ” “ Yes . Mr. Faucitt told me. ” “ Well ... ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , I 'm only human , ” argued Fillmore . “ I call that a very handsome admission . You 've got quite modest , Fill. ” He had certainly changed for the better since their last meeting . It was as if someone had punctured him and let out all the pomposity . If this was due , as Mr. Faucitt had suggested , to the influence of Miss Winch , Sally felt that she could not but approve of the romance . “ I 'll introduce you sometime , ' said Fillmore . “ I want to meet her very much. ” “ I 'll have to be going now . I 've got to see Bunbury . I thought he might be in here. ” “ Who 's Bunbury ? ” “ The producer . I suppose he is breakfasting in his room . I 'd better go up. ” “ You are busy , are n't you . Little marvel ! It 's lucky they 've got you to look after them. ” Fillmore retired and Sally settled down to wait for Gerald , no longer hurt by his manner over the telephone . Poor Gerald ! No wonder he had seemed upset . A few minutes later he came in . “ Oh , Jerry darling , ” said Sally , as he reached the table , “ I 'm so sorry . I 've just been hearing about it. ” Gerald sat down . His appearance fulfilled the promise of his voice over the telephone . A sort of nervous dullness wrapped him about like a garment . “ It 's just my luck , ” he said gloomily . “ It 's the kind of thing that could n't happen to anyone but me . Damned fools ! Where 's the sense in shutting the theatres , even if there is influenza about ? They let people jam against one another all day in the stores . If that does n't hurt them why should it hurt them to go to theatres ? Besides , it 's all infernal nonsense about this thing . I do n't believe there is such a thing as Spanish influenza . People get colds in their heads and think they're dying . It 's all a fake scare. ” “ I do n't think it 's that , ” said Sally . “ Poor Mr. Faucitt had it quite badly . That 's why I could n't come earlier. ” Gerald did not seem interested either by the news of Mr. Faucitt's illness or by the fact that Sally , after delay , had at last arrived . He dug a spoon sombrely into his grape-fruit . “ We 've been hanging about here day after day , getting bored to death all the time ... The company 's going all to pieces . They 're sick of rehearsing and rehearsing when nobody knows if we 'll ever open . They were all keyed up a week ago , and they 've been sagging ever since . It will ruin the play , of course . My first chance ! Just chucked away. ” Sally was listening with a growing feeling of desolation . She tried to be fair , to remember that he had had a terrible disappointment and was under a great strain . And yet ... it was unfortunate that self-pity was a thing she particularly disliked in a man . Her vanity , too , was hurt . It was obvious that her arrival , so far from acting as a magic restorative , had effected nothing . She could not help remembering , though it made her feel disloyal , what Mr. Faucitt had said about Gerald . She had never noticed before that he was remarkably self-centred , but he was thrusting the fact upon her attention now . “ That Hobson woman is beginning to make trouble , ” went on Gerald , prodding in a despairing sort of way at scrambled eggs . “ She ought never to have had the part , never . She ca n't handle it . Elsa Doland could play it a thousand times better . I wrote Elsa in a few lines the other day , and the Hobson woman went right up in the air . You do n't know what a star is till you 've seen one of these promoted clothes-props from the Follies trying to be one . It took me an hour to talk her round and keep her from throwing up her part. ” “ Why not let her throw up her part ? ” “ For heaven 's sake talk sense , ” said Gerald querulously . “ Do you suppose that man Cracknell would keep the play on if she was n't in it ? He would close the show in a second , and where would I be then ? You do n't seem to realize that this is a big chance for me . I 'd look a fool throwing it away. ” “ I see , ” said Sally , shortly . She had never felt so wretched in her life . Foreign travel , she decided , was a mistake . It might be pleasant and broadening to the mind , but it seemed to put you so out of touch with people when you got back . She analysed her sensations , and arrived at the conclusion that what she was resenting was the fact that Gerald was trying to get the advantages of two attitudes simultaneously . A man in trouble may either be the captain of his soul and superior to pity , or he may be a broken thing for a woman to pet and comfort . Gerald , it seemed to her , was advertising himself as an object for her commiseration , and at the same time raising a barrier against it . He appeared to demand her sympathy while holding himself aloof from it . She had the uncomfortable sensation of feeling herself shut out and useless . “ By the way , ” said Gerald , “ there 's one thing . I have to keep her jollying along all the time , so for goodness ' sake do n't go letting it out that we 're engaged. ” Sally 's chin went up with a jerk . This was too much . “ If you find it a handicap being engaged to me ... ” “ Do n't be silly. ” Gerald took refuge in pathos . “ Good God ! It 's tough !

Being the Person known by the name of the Lady Roxana , in the Time of King Charles II_ . Then for some years , various editions of _The Fortunate Mistress_ came out . For this reason , and because it has some literary merit , it is included in the present edition . She must have been born in 1673 , and consequently would have been sixty-nine in 1742 . The title-page announces that his heroine was `` known by the name of the Lady Roxana , in the Time of King Charles II . '' She must have been known by this name when she was a child of eleven or twelve , then , for she was ten when her parents fled to England `` about 1683 , '' and Charles II . died in February , 1685 . Moreover , she was not married till she was fifteen ; she lived eight years with her husband ; and then she was mistress successively to the friendly jeweller , the Prince , and the Dutch merchant . Yet after this career , she returned to London in time to become a noted toast among Charles II . 's courtiers and to entertain at her house that monarch and the Duke of Monmouth . A stronger argument for different authorship is the difference in style between the continuation of _Roxana_ and the earlier narrative . Now _frighten_ , and not _fright_ , is the verb used in the continuation . They do not _smile_ in the continuation . There are other differences between the original story of _The Fortunate Mistress_ and the continuation of 1745 . The former is better narrative than the latter ; it moves quicker ; it is more real . And yet there is a manifest attempt in the continuation to imitate the manner and the substance of the story proper . And finally , in understanding and reproducing the characters of Roxana and Amy , the anonymous author has done remarkably well . The character of the Dutch merchant , likewise , has not changed for the better in the continuation . He has developed a vindictiveness which , in our former meetings with him , seemed foreign to his nature . Though many of them are still wooden -- lifeless types , rather than individuals -- yet the Prince , the Quakeress , and the Dutch merchant occasionally wake to life ; so rather more does the unfortunate daughter ; and more yet , Amy and Roxana . The servant , Amy , thrown with another mistress , might have been a totally different woman . The vulgarity of a servant she would have retained under any circumstances , as she did even when promoted from being the maid to being the companion of Roxana ; but it was unreasoning devotion to her mistress , combined with weakness of character , which led Amy to be vicious . Roxana , for her part , had to the full the independence , the initiative , which her woman was without , -- or rather was without when acting for herself ; for when acting in the interests of her mistress , Amy was a different creature . After the first pang at parting with her five children , she seldom thinks of them except as encumbrances ; she will provide for them as decently as she can without personal inconvenience , but even a slight sacrifice for the sake of one of them is too much for her . Towards all the men with whom she has dealings , and towards the friendly Quakeress of the Minories , too , she shows a calculating reticence which is most unfeminine . The continuator of our story endowed the heroine with wholly characteristic selfishness when he made her , on hearing of Amy 's death , feel less sorrow for the miserable fate of her friend , than for her own loss of an adviser . And yet Roxana is capable of fine feeling , as is proved by those tears of joy for the happy change in her fortunes , which bring about that realistic love scene between her and the Prince in regard to the supposed paint on her cheeks . Again , when shipwreck threatens her and Amy , her emotion and repentance are due as much to the thought that she has degraded Amy to her own level as to thoughts of her more flagrant sins . That she is capable of feeling gratitude , she shows in her generosity to the Quakeress . And in her rage and remorse , on suspecting that her daughter has been murdered , and in her emotion several times on seeing her children , Roxana shows herself a true woman . In short , though for the most part monumentally selfish , she is yet saved from being impossible by several displays of noble emotion . At least he has succeeded in making two or three of his women characters more alive than any of his men . In the argument between Roxana and her Dutch merchant about a woman 's independence , Roxana talks like a character in a `` problem '' play or novel of our own day . This narrative of his is less loosely constructed than any others except _Robinson Crusoe_ and the _Journal of the Plague Year_ , which it was easier to give structure to . In both of them -- the story of a solitary on a desert island and the story of the visitation of a pestilence -- the nature of the subject made the author 's course tolerably plain ; in _The Fortunate Mistress_ , the proper course was by no means so well marked . There is no strongly defined plot , it is true ; but in general , if a character is introduced , he is heard from again ; a scene that impresses itself on the mind of the heroine is likely to be important in the sequel . The story seems to be working itself out to a logical conclusion , when unexpectedly it comes to an end . G.H . MAYNADIER . FOOTNOTES : [ 1 ] See Memoirs of a Cavalier [ 2 ] _An Essay upon Projects , An Academy for Women._ AUTHOR 'S PREFACE The history of this beautiful lady is to speak for itself ; if it is not as beautiful as the lady herself is reported to be ; if it is not as diverting as the reader can desire , and much more than he can reasonably expect ; and if all the most diverting parts of it are not adapted to the instruction and improvement of the reader , the relator says it must be from the defect of his performance ; dressing up the story in worse clothes than the lady whose words he speaks , prepared for the world . He takes the liberty to say that this story differs from most of the modern performances of this kind , though some of them have met with a very good reception in the world . I say , it differs from them in this great and essential article , namely , that the foundation of this is laid in truth of fact ; and so the work is not a story , but a history . The scene is laid so near the place where the main part of it was transacted that it was necessary to conceal names and persons , lest what can not be yet entirely forgot in that part of the town should be remembered , and the facts traced back too plainly by the many people yet living , who would know the persons by the particulars . It is not always necessary that the names of persons should be discovered , though the history may be many ways useful ; and if we should be always obliged to name the persons , or not to relate the story , the consequence might be only this -- that many a pleasant and delightful history would be buried in the dark , and the world deprived both of the pleasure and the profit of it . The writer says he was particularly acquainted with this lady 's first husband , the brewer , and with his father , and also with his bad circumstances , and knows that first part of the story to be truth . This may , he hopes , be a pledge for the credit of the rest , though the latter part of her history lay abroad , and could not be so well vouched as the first ; yet , as she has told it herself , we have the less reason to question the truth of that part also . In the manner she has told the story , it is evident she does not insist upon her justification in any one part of it ; much less does she recommend her conduct , or , indeed , any part of it , except her repentance , to our imitation . On the contrary , she makes frequent excursions , in a just censuring and condemning her own practice . How often does she reproach herself in the most passionate manner , and guide us to just reflections in the like cases ! It is true she met with unexpected success in all her wicked courses ; but even in the highest elevations of her prosperity she makes frequent acknowledgments that the pleasure of her wickedness was not worth the repentance ; and that all the satisfaction she had , all the joy in the view of her prosperity -- no , nor all the wealth she rolled in , the gaiety of her appearance , the equipages and the honours she was attended with , could quiet her mind , abate the reproaches of her conscience , or procure her an hour 's sleep when just reflection kept her waking . The noble inferences that are drawn from this one part are worth all the rest of the story , and abundantly justify , as they are the professed design of , the publication . If there are any parts in her story which , being obliged to relate a wicked action , seem to describe it too plainly , the writer says all imaginable care has been taken to keep clear of indecencies and immodest expressions ; and it is hoped you will find nothing to prompt a vicious mind , but everywhere much to discourage and expose it . Scenes of crime can scarce be represented in such a manner but some may make a criminal use of them ; but when vice is painted in its low-prized colours , it is not to make people in love with it , but to expose it ; and if the reader makes a wrong use of the figures , the wickedness is his own . In the meantime , the advantages of the present work are so great , and the virtuous reader has room for so much improvement , that we make no question the story , however meanly told , will find a passage to his best hours , and be read both with profit and delight . A HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF ROXANA I was born , as my friends told me , at the city of Poitiers , in the province or county of Poitou , in France , from whence I was brought to England by my parents , who fled for their religion about the year 1683 , when the Protestants were banished from France by the cruelty of their persecutors . I , who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for , was well enough pleased with being here . London , a large and gay city , took with me mighty well , who , from my being a child , loved a crowd , and to see a great many fine folks . I retained nothing of France but the language , my father and mother being people of better fashion than ordinarily the people called refugees at that time were ; and having fled early , while it was easy to secure their effects , had , before their coming over , remitted considerable sums of money , or , as I remember , a considerable value in French brandy , paper , and other goods ; and these selling very much to advantage here , my father was in very good circumstances at his coming over , so that he was far from applying to the rest of our nation that were here for countenance and relief . On the contrary , he had his door continually thronged with miserable objects of the poor starving creatures who at that time fled hither for shelter on account of conscience , or something else . I have indeed heard my father say that he was pestered with a great many of those who , for any religion they had , might e'en have stayed where they were , but who flocked over hither in droves , for what they call in English a livelihood ; hearing with what open arms the refugees were received in England , and how they fell readily into business , being , by the charitable assistance of the people in London , encouraged to work in their manufactories in Spitalfields , Canterbury , and other places , and that they had a much better price for their work than in France , and the like . My father , I say , told me that he was more pestered with the clamours of these people than of those who were truly refugees , and fled in distress merely for conscience . I was about ten years old when I was brought over hither , where , as I have said , my father lived in very good circumstances , and died in about eleven years more ; in which time , as I had accomplished myself for the sociable part of the world , so I had acquainted myself with some of our English neighbours , as is the custom in London ; and as , while I was young , I had picked up three or four playfellows and companions suitable to my years , so , as we grew bigger , we learned to call one another intimates and friends ; and this forwarded very much the finishing me for conversation and the world . I went to English schools , and being young , I learned the English tongue perfectly well , with all the customs of the English young women ; so that I retained nothing of the French but the speech ; nor did I so much as keep any remains of the French language tagged to my way of speaking , as most foreigners do , but spoke what we call natural English , as if I had been born here . Being to give my own character , I must be excused to give it as impartially as possible , and as if I was speaking of another body ; and the sequel will lead you to judge whether I flatter myself or no . I was ( speaking of myself at about fourteen years of age ) tall , and very well made ; sharp as a hawk in matters of common knowledge ; quick and smart in discourse ; apt to be satirical ; full of repartee ; and a little too forward in conversation , or , as we call it in English , bold , though perfectly modest in my behaviour . Being French born , I danced , as some say , naturally , loved it extremely , and sang well also , and so well that , as you will hear , it was afterwards some advantage to me . With all these things , I wanted neither wit , beauty , or money . In this manner I set out into the world , having all the advantages that any young woman could desire , to recommend me to others , and form a prospect of happy living to myself . At about fifteen years of age , my father gave me , as he called it in French , 25,000 livres , that is to say , two thousand pounds portion , and married me to an eminent brewer in the city . Pardon me if I conceal his name ; for though he was the foundation of my ruin , I can not take so severe a revenge upon him . With this thing called a husband I lived eight years in good fashion , and for some part of the time kept a coach , that is to say , a kind of mock coach ; for all the week the horses were kept at work in the dray-carts ; but on Sunday I had the privilege to go abroad in my chariot , either to church or otherways , as my husband and I could agree about it , which , by the way , was not very often ; but of that hereafter . Before I proceed in the history of the married part of my life , you must allow me to give as impartial an account of my husband as I have done of myself . He was a jolly , handsome fellow , as any woman need wish for a companion ; tall and well made ; rather a little too large , but not so as to be ungenteel ; he danced well , which I think was the first thing that brought us together . He had an old father who managed the business carefully , so that he had little of that part lay on him , but now and then to appear and show himself ; and he took the advantage of it , for he troubled himself very little about it , but went abroad , kept company , hunted much , and loved it exceedingly . After I have told you that he was a handsome man and a good sportsman , I have indeed said all ; and unhappy was I , like other young people of our sex , I chose him for being a handsome , jolly fellow , as I have said ; for he was otherwise a weak , empty-headed , untaught creature , as any woman could ever desire to be coupled with . And here I must take the liberty , whatever I have to reproach myself with in my after conduct , to turn to my fellow-creatures , the young ladies of this country , and speak to them by way of precaution . If you have any regard to your future happiness , any view of living comfortably with a husband , any hope of preserving your fortunes , or restoring them after any disaster , never , ladies , marry a fool ; any husband rather than a fool . With some other husbands you may be unhappy , but with a fool you will be miserable ; with another husband you may , I say , be unhappy , but with a fool you must ; nay , if he would , he can not make you easy ; everything he does is so awkward , everything he says is so empty , a woman of any sense can not but be surfeited and sick of him twenty times a day . What is more shocking than for a woman to bring a handsome , comely fellow of a husband into company , and then be obliged to blush for him every time she hears him speak ? to hear other gentlemen talk sense , and he able to say nothing ? and so look like a fool , or , which is worse , hear him talk nonsense , and be laughed at for a fool . In the next place , there are so many sorts of fools , such an infinite variety of fools , and so hard it is to know the worst of the kind , that I am obliged to say , `` No fool , ladies , at all , no kind of fool , whether a mad fool or a sober fool , a wise fool or a silly fool ; take anything but a fool ; nay , be anything , be even an old maid , the worst of nature's curses , rather than take up with a fool . '' But to leave this awhile , for I shall have occasion to speak of it again ; my case was particularly hard , for I had a variety of foolish things complicated in this unhappy match . First , and which I must confess is very unsufferable , he was a conceited fool , _tout opiniatre_ ; everything he said was right , was best , and was to the purpose , whoever was in company , and whatever was advanced by others , though with the greatest modesty imaginable . And yet , when he came to defend what he had said by argument and reason , he would do it so weakly , so emptily , and so nothing to the purpose , that it was enough to make anybody that heard him sick and ashamed of him . Secondly , he was positive and obstinate , and the most positive in the most simple and inconsistent things , such as were intolerable to bear . These two articles , if there had been no more , qualified him to be a most unbearable creature for a husband ; and so it may be supposed at first sight what a kind of life I led with him . However , I did as well as I could , and held my tongue , which was the only victory I gained over him ; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling way with me , and I would not answer , or enter into discourse with him on the point he was upon , he would rise up in the greatest passion imaginable , and go away , which was the cheapest way I had to be delivered . I could enlarge here much upon the method I took to make my life passable and easy with the most incorrigible temper in the world ; but it is too long , and the articles too trifling . I shall mention some of them as the circumstances I am to relate shall necessarily bring them in . After I had been married about four years , my own father died , my mother having been dead before . He liked my match so ill , and saw so little room to be satisfied with the conduct of my husband , that though he left me five thousand livres , and more , at his death , yet he left it in the hands of my elder brother , who , running on too rashly in his adventures as a merchant , failed , and lost not only what he had , but what he had for me too , as you shall hear presently . Thus I lost the last gift of my father 's bounty by having a husband not fit to be trusted with it : there 's one of the benefits of marrying a fool . Within two years after my own father 's death my husband 's father also died , and , as I thought , left him a considerable addition to his estate , the whole trade of the brewhouse , which was a very good one , being now his own . But this addition to his stock was his ruin , for he had no genius to business , he had no knowledge of his accounts ; he bustled a little about it , indeed , at first , and put on a face of business , but he soon grew slack ; it was below him to inspect his books , he committed all that to his clerks and book-keepers ; and while he found money in cash to pay the maltman and the excise , and put some in his pocket , he was perfectly easy and indolent , let the main chance go how it would . I foresaw the consequence of this , and attempted several times to persuade him to apply himself to his business ; I put him in mind how his customers complained of the neglect of his servants on one hand , and how abundance broke in his debt , on the other hand , for want of the clerk's care to secure him , and the like ; but he thrust me by , either with hard words , or fraudulently , with representing the cases otherwise than they were . However , to cut short a dull story , which ought not to be long , he began to find his trade sunk , his stock declined , and that , in short , he could not carry on his business , and once or twice his brewing utensils were extended for the excise ; and , the last time , he was put to great extremities to clear them . This alarmed him , and he resolved to lay down his trade ; which , indeed , I was not sorry for ; foreseeing that if he did not lay it down in time , he would be forced to do it another way , namely , as a bankrupt . Also I was willing he should draw out while he had something left , lest I should come to be stripped at home , and be turned out of doors with my children ; for I had now five children by him , the only work ( perhaps ) that fools are good for . I thought myself happy when he got another man to take his brewhouse clear off his hands ; for , paying down a large sum of money , my husband found himself a clear man , all his debts paid , and with between two and three thousand pounds in his pocket ; and being now obliged to remove from the brewhouse , we took a house at -- -- , a village about two miles out of town ; and happy I thought myself , all things considered , that I was got off clear , upon so good terms ; and had my handsome fellow had but one capful of wit , I had been still well enough . I proposed to him either to buy some place with the money , or with part of it , and offered to join my part to it , which was then in being , and might have been secured ; so we might have lived tolerably at least during his life . But as it is the part of a fool to be void of counsel , so he neglected it , lived on as he did before , kept his horses and men , rid every day out to the forest a-hunting , and nothing was done all this while ; but the money decreased apace , and I thought I saw my ruin hastening on without any possible way to prevent it . I was not wanting with all that persuasions and entreaties could perform , but it was all fruitless ; representing to him how fast our money wasted , and what would be our condition when it was gone , made no impression on him ; but like one stupid , he went on , not valuing all that tears and lamentations could be supposed to do ; nor did he abate his figure or equipage , his horses or servants , even to the last , till he had not a hundred pounds left in the whole world . It was not above three years that all the ready money was thus spending off ; yet he spent it , as I may say , foolishly too , for he kept no valuable company neither , but generally with huntsmen and horse-coursers , and men meaner than himself , which is another consequence of a man 's being a fool ; such can never take delight in men more wise and capable than themselves , and that makes them converse with scoundrels , drink , belch with porters , and keep company always below themselves . This was my wretched condition , when one morning my husband told me he was sensible he was come to a miserable condition , and he would go and seek his fortune somewhere or other . He had said something to that purpose several times before that , upon my pressing him to consider his circumstances , and the circumstances of his family , before it should be too late ; but as I found he had no meaning in anything of that kind , as , indeed , he had not much in anything he ever said , so I thought they were but words of course now . When he had said he would be gone , I used to wish secretly , and even say in my thoughts , I wish you would , for if you go on thus you will starve us all . He stayed , however , at home all that day , and lay at home that night ; early the next morning he gets out of bed , goes to a window which looked out towards the stable , and sounds his French horn , as he called it , which was his usual signal to call his men to go out a-hunting . It was about the latter end of August , and so was light yet at five o'clock , and it was about that time that I heard him and his two men go out and shut the yard gates after them . He said nothing to me more than as usual when he used to go out upon his sport ; neither did I rise , or say anything to him that was material , but went to sleep again after he was gone , for two hours or thereabouts . It must be a little surprising to the reader to tell him at once , that after this I never saw my husband more ; but , to go farther , I not only never saw him more , but I never heard from him , or of him , neither of any or either of his two servants , or of the horses , either what became of them , where or which way they went , or what they did or intended to do , no more than if the ground had opened and swallowed them all up , and nobody had known it , except as hereafter . I was not , for the first night or two , at all surprised , no , nor very much the first week or two , believing that if anything evil had befallen them , I should soon enough have heard of that ; and also knowing , that as he had two servants and three horses with him , it would be the strangest thing in the world that anything could befall them all but that I must some time or other hear of them . But you will easily allow , that as time ran on , a week , two weeks , a month , two months , and so on , I was dreadfully frighted at last , and the more when I looked into my own circumstances , and considered the condition in which I was left with five children , and not one farthing subsistence for them , other than about seventy pounds in money , and what few things of value I had about me , which , though considerable in themselves , were yet nothing to feed a family , and for a length of time too . [ Illustration : THE BREWER AND HIS MEN I heard him and his two men go out and shut the yard gates after them ] What to do I knew not , nor to whom to have recourse : to keep in the house where I was , I could not , the rent being too great ; and to leave it without his orders , if my husband should return , I could not think of that neither ; so that I continued extremely perplexed , melancholy , and discouraged to the last degree . I remained in this dejected condition near a twelvemonth . My husband had two sisters , who were married , and lived very well , and some other near relations that I knew of , and I hoped would do something for me ; and I frequently sent to these , to know if they could give me any account of my vagrant creature . But they all declared to me in answer , that they knew nothing about him ; and , after frequent sending , began to think me troublesome , and to let me know they thought so too , by their treating my maid with very slight and unhandsome returns to her inquiries . This grated hard , and added to my affliction ; but I had no recourse but to my tears , for I had not a friend of my own left me in the world . I should have observed , that it was about half a year before this elopement of my husband that the disaster I mentioned above befell my brother , who broke , and that in such bad circumstances , that I had the mortification to hear , not only that he was in prison , but that there would be little or nothing to be had by way of composition . Misfortunes seldom come alone : this was the forerunner of my husband's flight ; and as my expectations were cut off on that side , my husband gone , and my family of children on my hands , and nothing to subsist them , my condition was the most deplorable that words can express . I had some plate and some jewels , as might be supposed , my fortune and former circumstances considered ; and my husband , who had never stayed to be distressed , had not been put to the necessity of rifling me , as husbands usually do in such cases . But as I had seen an end of all the ready money during the long time I had lived in a state of expectation for my husband , so I began to make away one thing after another , till those few things of value which I had began to lessen apace , and I saw nothing but misery and the utmost distress before me , even to have my children starve before my face . I leave any one that is a mother of children , and has lived in plenty and in good fashion , to consider and reflect what must be my condition . As to my husband , I had now no hope or expectation of seeing him any more ; and indeed , if I had , he was a man of all the men in the world the least able to help me , or to have turned his hand to the gaining one shilling towards lessening our distress ; he neither had the capacity or the inclination ; he could have been no clerk , for he scarce wrote a legible hand ; he was so far from being able to write sense , that he could not make sense of what others wrote ; he was so far from understanding good English , that he could not spell good English ; to be out of all business was his delight , and he would stand leaning against a post for half-an-hour together , with a pipe in his mouth , with all the tranquillity in the world , smoking , like Dryden 's countryman , that whistled as he went for want of thought , and this even when his family was , as it were , starving , that little he had wasting , and that we were all bleeding to death ; he not knowing , and as little considering , where to get another shilling when the last was spent . This being his temper , and the extent of his capacity , I confess I did not see so much loss in his parting with me as at first I thought I did ; though it was hard and cruel to the last degree in him , not giving me the least notice of his design ; and indeed , that which I was most astonished at was , that seeing he must certainly have intended this excursion some few moments at least before he put it in practice , yet he did not come and take what little stock of money we had left , or at least a share of it , to bear his expense for a little while ; but he did not ; and I am morally certain he had not five guineas with him in the world when he went away . All that I could come to the knowledge of about him was , that he left his hunting-horn , which he called the French horn , in the stable , and his hunting-saddle , went away in a handsome furniture , as they call it , which he used sometimes to travel with , having an embroidered housing , a case of pistols , and other things belonging to them ; and one of his servants had another saddle with pistols , though plain , and the other a long gun ; so that they did not go out as sportsmen , but rather as travellers ; what part of the world they went to I never heard for many years . As I have said , I sent to his relations , but they sent me short and surly answers ; nor did any one of them offer to come to see me , or to see the children , or so much as to inquire after them , well perceiving that I was in a condition that was likely to be soon troublesome to them . But it was no time now to dally with them or with the world ; I left off sending to them , and went myself among them , laid my circumstances open to them , told them my whole case , and the condition I was reduced to , begged they would advise me what course to take , laid myself as low as they could desire , and entreated them to consider that I was not in a condition to help myself , and that without some assistance we must all inevitably perish . I told them that if I had had but one child , or two children , I would have done my endeavour to have worked for them with my needle , and should only have come to them to beg them to help me to some work , that I might get our bread by my labour ; but to think of one single woman , not bred to work , and at a loss where to get employment , to get the bread of five children , that was not possible -- some of my children being young too , and none of them big enough to help one another . It was all one ; I received not one farthing of assistance from anybody , was hardly asked to sit down at the two sisters ' houses , nor offered to eat or drink at two more near relations ' . The fifth , an ancient gentlewoman , aunt-in-law to my husband , a widow , and the least able also of any of the rest , did , indeed , ask me to sit down , gave me a dinner , and refreshed me with a kinder treatment than any of the rest , but added the melancholy part , viz. , that she would have helped me , but that , indeed , she was not able , which , however , I was satisfied was very true . Here I relieved myself with the constant assistant of the afflicted , I mean tears ; for , relating to her how I was received by the other of my husband 's relations , it made me burst into tears , and I cried vehemently for a great while together , till I made the good old gentlewoman cry too several times . However , I came home from them all without any relief , and went on at home till I was reduced to such inexpressible distress that is not to be described . I had been several times after this at the old aunt 's , for I prevailed with her to promise me to go and talk with the other relations , at least , that , if possible , she could bring some of them to take off the children , or to contribute something towards their maintenance . And , to do her justice , she did use her endeavour with them ; but all was to no purpose , they would do nothing , at least that way . I think , with much entreaty , she obtained , by a kind of collection among them all , about eleven or twelve shillings in money , which , though it was a present comfort , was yet not to be named as capable to deliver me from any part of the load that lay upon me . There was a poor woman that had been a kind of a dependent upon our family , and whom I had often , among the rest of the relations , been very kind to ; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor woman , and to see whether she might not be able to help in this dreadful case . I must remember it here , to the praise of this poor girl , my maid , that though I was not able to give her any wages , and had told her so -- nay , I was not able to pay her the wages that I was in arrears to her -- yet she would not leave me ; nay , and as long as she had any money , when I had none , she would help me out of her own , for which , though I acknowledged her kindness and fidelity , yet it was but a bad coin that she was paid in at last , as will appear in its place . Amy ( for that was her name ) put it into my thoughts to send for this poor woman to come to me ; for I was now in great distress , and I resolved to do so . But just the very morning that I intended it , the old aunt , with the poor woman in her company , came to see me ; the good old gentlewoman was , it seems , heartily concerned for me , and had been talking again among those people , to see what she could do for me , but to very little purpose . You shall judge a little of my present distress by the posture she found me in . I had five little children , the eldest was under ten years old , and I had not one shilling in the house to buy them victuals , but had sent Amy out with a silver spoon to sell it , and bring home something from the butcher 's ; and I was in a parlour , sitting on the ground , with a great heap of old rags , linen , and other things about me , looking them over , to see if I had anything among them that would sell or pawn for a little money , and had been crying ready to burst myself , to think what I should do next . At this juncture they knocked at the door . I thought it had been Amy , so I did not rise up ; but one of the children opened the door , and they came directly into the room where I was , and where they found me in that posture , and crying vehemently , as above . I was surprised at their coming , you may be sure , especially seeing the person I had but just before resolved to send for ; but when they saw me , how I looked , for my eyes were swelled with crying , and what a condition I was in as to the house , and the heaps of things that were about me , and especially when I told them what I was doing , and on what occasion , they sat down , like Job 's three comforters , and said not one word to me for a great while , but both of them cried as fast and as heartily as I did . The truth was , there was no need of much discourse in the case , the thing spoke itself ; they saw me in rags and dirt , who was but a little before riding in my coach ; thin , and looking almost like one starved , who was before fat and beautiful . The house , that was before handsomely furnished with pictures and ornaments , cabinets , pier-glasses , and everything suitable , was now stripped and naked , most of the goods having been seized by the landlord for rent , or sold to buy necessaries ; in a word , all was misery and distress , the face of ruin was everywhere to be seen ; we had eaten up almost everything , and little remained , unless , like one of the pitiful women of Jerusalem , I should eat up my very children themselves . After these two good creatures had sat , as I say , in silence some time , and had then looked about them , my maid Amy came in , and brought with her a small breast of mutton and two great bunches of turnips , which she intended to stew for our dinner . As for me , my heart was so overwhelmed at seeing these two friends -- for such they were , though poor -- and at their seeing me in such a condition , that I fell into another violent fit of crying , so that , in short , I could not speak to them again for a great while longer . During my being in such an agony , they went to my maid Amy at another part of the same room and talked with her . Amy told them all my circumstances , and set them forth in such moving terms , and so to the life , that I could not upon any terms have done it like her myself , and , in a word , affected them both with it in such a manner , that the old aunt came to me , and though hardly able to speak for tears , `` Look ye , cousin , '' said she , in a few words , `` things must not stand thus ; some course must be taken , and that forthwith ; pray , where were these children born ? '' I told her the parish where we lived before , that four of them were born there , and one in the house where I now was , where the landlord , after having seized my goods for the rent past , not then knowing my circumstances , had now given me leave to live for a whole year more without any rent , being moved with compassion ; but that this year was now almost expired . Upon hearing this account , they came to this resolution , that the children should be all carried by them to the door of one of the relations mentioned above , and be set down there by the maid Amy , and that I , the mother , should remove for some days , shut up the doors , and be gone ; that the people should be told , that if they did not think fit to take some care of the children , they might send for the churchwardens if they thought that better , for that they were born in that parish , and there they must be provided for ; as for the other child , which was born in the parish of -- -- , that was already taken care of by the parish officers there , for indeed they were so sensible of the distress of the family that they had at first word done what was their part to do . This was what these good women proposed , and bade me leave the rest to them . I was at first sadly afflicted at the thoughts of parting with my children , and especially at that terrible thing , their being taken into the parish keeping ; and then a hundred terrible things came into my thoughts , viz. , of parish children being starved at nurse ; of their being ruined , let grow crooked , lamed , and the like , for want of being taken care of ; and this sunk my very heart within me . But the misery of my own circumstances hardened my heart against my own flesh and blood ; and when I considered they must inevitably be starved , and I too if I continued to keep them about me , I began to be reconciled to parting with them all , anyhow and anywhere , that I might be freed from the dreadful necessity of seeing them all perish , and perishing with them myself . So I agreed to go away out of the house , and leave the management of the whole matter to my maid Amy and to them ; and accordingly I did so , and the same afternoon they carried them all away to one of their aunts . Amy , a resolute girl , knocked at the door , with the children all with her , and bade the eldest , as soon as the door was open , run in , and the rest after her . She set them all down at the door before she knocked , and when she knocked she stayed till a maid-servant came to the door ; '' Sweetheart , '' said she , `` pray go in and tell your mistress here are her little cousins come to see her from -- -- , '' naming the town where we lived , at which the maid offered to go back . `` Here , child , '' says Amy , '' take one of 'em in your hand , and I 'll bring the rest ; '' so she gives her the least , and the wench goes in mighty innocently , with the little one in her hand , upon which Amy turns the rest in after her , shuts the door softly , and marches off as fast as she could . Just in the interval of this , and even while the maid and her mistress were quarrelling ( for the mistress raved and scolded her like a mad woman , and had ordered her to go and stop the maid Amy , and turn all the children out of the doors again ; but she had been at the door , and Amy was gone , and the wench was out of her wits , and the mistress too ) , I say , just at this juncture came the poor old woman , not the aunt , but the other of the two that had been with me , and knocks at the door : the aunt did not go , because she had pretended to advocate for me , and they would have suspected her of some contrivance ; but as for the other woman , they did not so much as know that she had kept up any correspondence with me . Amy and she had concerted this between them , and it was well enough contrived that they did so . When she came into the house , the mistress was fuming , and raging like one distracted , and called the maid all the foolish jades and sluts that she could think of , and that she would take the children and turn them all out into the streets . The good poor woman , seeing her in such a passion , turned about as if she would be gone again , and said , `` Madam , I 'll come again another time , I see you are engaged . '' `` No , no , Mrs. -- -- , '' says the mistress , `` I am not much engaged , sit down ; this senseless creature here has brought in my fool of a brother 's whole house of children upon me , and tells me that a wench brought them to the door and thrust them in , and bade her carry them to me ; but it shall be no disturbance to me , for I have ordered them to be set in the street without the door , and so let the churchwardens take care of them , or else make this dull jade carry 'em back to -- -- again , and let her that brought them into the world look after them if she will ; what does she send her brats to me for ? '' `` The last indeed had been the best of the two , '' says the poor woman , `` if it had been to be done ; and that brings me to tell you my errand , and the occasion of my coming , for I came on purpose about this very business , and to have prevented this being put upon you if I could , but I see I am come too late . '' `` How do you mean too late ? '' says the mistress . `` What ! have you been concerned in this affair , then ? What ! have you helped bring this family slur upon us ? '' `` I hope you do not think such a thing of me , madam , '' says the poor woman ; `` but I went this morning to -- -- , to see my old mistress and benefactor , for she had been very kind to me , and when I came to the door I found all fast locked and bolted , and the house looking as if nobody was at home . `` I knocked at the door , but nobody came , till at last some of the neighbours ' servants called to me and said , 'There 's nobody lives there , mistress ; what do you knock for ? ' I seemed surprised at that . 'What , nobody lives there ! ' said I ; 'what d 'ye mean ? Does not Mrs. -- -- live there ? ' The answer was , 'No , she is gone ; ' at which I parleyed with one of them , and asked her what was the matter . 'Matter ! ' says she , 'why , it is matter enough : the poor gentlewoman has lived there all alone , and without anything to subsist her a long time , and this morning the landlord turned her out of doors . ' `` 'Out of doors ! ' says I ; 'what ! with all her children ? Poor lambs , what is become of them ? ' 'Why , truly , nothing worse , ' said they , 'can come to them than staying here , for they were almost starved with hunger ; so the neighbours , seeing the poor lady in such distress , for she stood crying and wringing her hands over her children like one distracted , sent for the churchwardens to take care of the children ; and they , when they came , took the youngest , which was born in this parish , and have got it a very good nurse , and taken care of it ; but as for the other four , they had sent them away to some of their father 's relations , and who were very substantial people , and who , besides that , lived in the parish where they were born . ' `` I was not so surprised at this as not presently to foresee that this trouble would be brought upon you or upon Mr. -- -- ; so I came immediately to bring word of it , that you might be prepared for it , and might not be surprised ; but I see they have been too nimble for me , so that I know not what to advise . The poor woman , it seems , is turned out of doors into the street ; and another of the neighbours there told me , that when they took her children from her she swooned away , and when they recovered her out of that , she ran distracted , and is put into a madhouse by the parish , for there is nobody else to take any care of her . '' This was all acted to the life by this good , kind , poor creature ; for though her design was perfectly good and charitable , yet there was not one word of it true in fact ; for I was not turned out of doors by the landlord , nor gone distracted . It was true , indeed , that at parting with my poor children I fainted , and was like one mad when I came to myself and found they were gone ; but I remained in the house a good while after that , as you shall hear . While the poor woman was telling this dismal story , in came the gentlewoman 's husband , and though her heart was hardened against all pity , who was really and nearly related to the children , for they were the children of her own brother , yet the good man was quite softened with the dismal relation of the circumstances of the family ; and when the poor woman had done , he said to his wife , `` This is a dismal case , my dear , indeed , and something must be done . '' His wife fell a-raving at him : `` What , '' says she , `` do you want to have four children to keep ? Have we not children of our own ? Would you have these brats come and eat up my children 's bread ? No , no , let 'em go to the parish , and let them take care of them ; I 'll take care of my own . '' `` Come , come , my dear , '' says the husband , `` charity is a duty to the poor , and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord ; let us lend our heavenly Father a little of our children 's bread , as you call it ; it will be a store well laid up for them , and will be the best security that our children shall never come to want charity , or be turned out of doors , as these poor innocent creatures are . '' `` Do n't tell me of security , '' says the wife , `` 't is a good security for our children to keep what we have together , and provide for them , and then 't is time enough to help keep other folks ' children . Charity begins at home . '' `` Well , my dear , '' says he again , `` I only talk of putting out a little money to interest : our Maker is a good borrower ; never fear making a bad debt there , child , I 'll be bound for it . '' `` Do n't banter me with your charity and your allegories , '' says the wife angrily ; `` I tell you they are my relations , not yours , and they shall not roost here ; they shall go to the parish . '' `` All your relations are my relations now , '' says the good gentleman very calmly , `` and I wo n't see your relations in distress , and not pity them , any more than I would my own ; indeed , my dear , they sha n't go to the parish . I assure you , none of my wife 's relations shall come to the parish , if I can help it . '' `` What ! will you take four children to keep ? '' says the wife . `` No , no , my dear , '' says he , `` there 's your sister -- -- , I 'll go and talk with her ; and your uncle -- -- , I 'll send for him , and the rest . I'll warrant you , when we are all together , we will find ways and means to keep four poor little creatures from beggary and starving , or else it would be very hard ; we are none of us in so bad circumstances but we are able to spare a mite for the fatherless . Do n't shut up your bowels of compassion against your own flesh and blood . Could you hear these poor innocent children cry at your door for hunger , and give them no bread ? '' `` Prithee , what need they cry at our door ? '' says she . `` 'T is the business of the parish to provide for them ; they sha n't cry at our door . If they do , I 'll give them nothing . '' `` Wo n't you ? '' says he ; `` but I will . Remember that dreadful Scripture is directly against us , Prov . xxi . 13 , 'Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard . ' '' `` Well , well , '' says she , `` you must do what you will , because you pretend to be master ; but if I had my will I would send them where they ought to be sent : I would send them from whence they came . '' Then the poor woman put in , and said , `` But , madam , that is sending them to starve indeed , for the parish has no obligation to take care of 'em , and so they will lie and perish in the street . '' `` Or be sent back again , '' says the husband , `` to our parish in a cripple-cart , by the justice 's warrant , and so expose us and all the relations to the last degree among our neighbours , and among those who know the good old gentleman their grandfather , who lived and flourished in this parish so many years , and was so well beloved among all people , and deserved it so well . '' `` I do n't value that one farthing , not I , '' says the wife ; `` I 'll keep none of them . '' `` Well , my dear , '' says her husband , `` but I value it , for I wo n't have such a blot lie upon the family , and upon your children ; he was a worthy , ancient , and good man , and his name is respected among all his neighbours ; it will be a reproach to you , that are his daughter , and to our children , that are his grandchildren , that we should let your brother 's children perish , or come to be a charge to the public , in the very place where your family once flourished . Come , say no more ; I will see what can be done . '' Upon this he sends and gathers all the relations together at a tavern hard by , and sent for the four little children , that they might see them ; and they all , at first word , agreed to have them taken care of , and , because his wife was so furious that she would not suffer one of them to be kept at home , they agreed to keep them all together for a while ; so they committed them to the poor woman that had managed the affair for them , and entered into obligations to one another to supply the needful sums for their maintenance ; and , not to have one separated from the rest , they sent for the youngest from the parish where it was taken in , and had them all brought up together . It would take up too long a part of this story to give a particular account with what a charitable tenderness this good person , who was but an uncle-in-law to them , managed that affair ; how careful he was of them ; went constantly to see them , and to see that they were well provided for , clothed , put to school , and , at last , put out in the world for their advantage ; but it is enough to say he acted more like a father to them than an uncle-in-law , though all along much against his wife's consent , who was of a disposition not so tender and compassionate as her husband . You may believe I heard this with the same pleasure which I now feel at the relating it again ; for I was terribly affrighted at the apprehensions of my children being brought to misery and distress , as those must be who have no friends , but are left to parish benevolence . I was now , however , entering on a new scene of life . I had a great house upon my hands , and some furniture left in it ; but I was no more able to maintain myself and my maid Amy in it than I was my five children ; nor had I anything to subsist with but what I might get by working , and that was not a town where much work was to be had . My landlord had been very kind indeed after he came to know my circumstances ; though , before he was acquainted with that part , he had gone so far as to seize my goods , and to carry some of them off too . But I had lived three-quarters of a year in his house after that , and had paid him no rent , and , which was worse , I was in no condition to pay him any . However , I observed he came oftener to see me , looked kinder upon me , and spoke more friendly to me , than he used to do , particularly the last two or three times he had been there . He observed , he said , how poorly I lived , how low I was reduced , and the like ; told me it grieved him for my sake ; and the last time of all he was kinder still , told me he came to dine with me , and that I should give him leave to treat me ; so he called my maid Amy , and sent her out to buy a joint of meat ; he told her what she should buy ; but naming two or three things , either of which she might take , the maid , a cunning wench , and faithful to me as the skin to my back , did not buy anything outright , but brought the butcher along with her , with both the things that she had chosen , for him to please himself . The one was a large , very good leg of veal ; the other a piece of the fore-ribs of roasting beef . He looked at them , but made me chaffer with the butcher for him , and I did so , and came back to him and told him what the butcher had demanded for either of them , and what each of them came to . So he pulls out eleven shillings and threepence , which they came to together , and bade me take them both ; the rest , he said , would serve another time . I was surprised , you may be sure , at the bounty of a man that had but a little while ago been my terror , and had torn the goods out of my house like a fury ; but I considered that my distresses had mollified his temper , and that he had afterwards been so compassionate as to give me leave to live rent free in the house a whole year . But now he put on the face , not of a man of compassion only , but of a man of friendship and kindness , and this was so unexpected that it was surprising . We chatted together , and were , as I may call it , cheerful , which was more than I could say I had been for three years before . He sent for wine and beer too , for I had none ; poor Amy and I had drank nothing but water for many weeks , and indeed I have often wondered at the faithful temper of the poor girl , for which I but ill requited her at last . When Amy was come with the wine , he made her fill a glass to him , and with the glass in his hand he came to me and kissed me , which I was , I confess , a little surprised at , but more at what followed ; for he told me , that as the sad condition which I was reduced to had made him pity me , so my conduct in it , and the courage I bore it with , had given him a more than ordinary respect for me , and made him very thoughtful for my good ; that he was resolved for the present to do something to relieve me , and to employ his thoughts in the meantime , to see if he could for the future put me into a way to support myself . While he found me change colour , and look surprised at his discourse , for so I did , to be sure , he turns to my maid Amy , and looking at her , he says to me , `` I say all this , madam , before your maid , because both she and you shall know that I have no ill design , and that I have , in mere kindness , resolved to do something for you if I can ; and as I have been a witness of the uncommon honesty and fidelity of Mrs. Amy here to you in all your distresses , I know she may be trusted with so honest a design as mine is ; for I assure you , I bear a proportioned regard to your maid too , for her affection to you . '' Amy made him a curtsey , and the poor girl looked so confounded with joy that she could not speak , but her colour came and went , and every now and then she blushed as red as scarlet , and the next minute looked as pale as death . Well , having said this , he sat down , made me sit down , and then drank to me , and made me drink two glasses of wine together ; '' For , '' says he , `` you have need of it ; '' and so indeed I had . When he had done so , `` Come , Amy , '' says he , `` with your mistress 's leave , you shall have a glass too . '' So he made her drink two glasses also ; and then rising up , `` And now , Amy , '' says he , `` go and get dinner ; and you , madam , '' says he to me , `` go up and dress you , and come down and smile and be merry ; '' adding , `` I 'll make you easy if I can ; '' and in the meantime , he said , he would walk in the garden . When he was gone , Amy changed her countenance indeed , and looked as merry as ever she did in her life . `` Dear madam , '' says she , `` what does this gentleman mean ? '' `` Nay , Amy , '' said I , `` he means to do us good , you see , do n't he ? I know no other meaning he can have , for he can get nothing by me . '' `` I warrant you , madam , '' says she , `` he 'll ask you a favour by-and-by . '' `` No , no , you are mistaken , Amy , I dare say , '' said I ; '' you have heard what he said , did n't you ? '' `` Ay , '' says Amy , `` it 's no matter for that , you shall see what he will do after dinner . '' `` Well , well , Amy , '' says I , `` you have hard thoughts of him . I can not be of your opinion : I do n't see anything in him yet that looks like it . '' `` As to that , madam , '' says Amy , `` I do n't see anything of it yet neither ; but what should move a gentleman to take pity of us as he does ? '' `` Nay , '' says I , `` that 's a hard thing too , that we should judge a man to be wicked because he 's charitable , and vicious because he 's kind . '' `` Oh , madam , '' says Amy , `` there 's abundance of charity begins in that vice ; and he is not so unacquainted with things as not to know that poverty is the strongest incentive -- a temptation against which no virtue is powerful enough to stand out . He knows your condition as well as you do . '' `` Well , and what then ? '' `` Why , then , he knows too that you are young and handsome , and he has the surest bait in the world to take you with . '' `` Well , Amy , '' said I , `` but he may find himself mistaken too in such a thing as that . '' `` Why , madam , '' says Amy , `` I hope you wo n't deny him if he should offer it . '' `` What d 'ye mean by that , hussy ? '' said I . `` No , I 'd starve first . '' `` I hope not , madam , I hope you would be wiser ; I 'm sure if he will set you up , as he talks of , you ought to deny him nothing ; and you will starve if you do not consent , that 's certain . '' `` What ! consent to lie with him for bread ? Amy , '' said I , `` how can you talk so ! '' `` Nay , madam , '' says Amy , `` I do n't think you would for anything else ; it would not be lawful for anything else , but for bread , madam ; why , nobody can starve , there 's no bearing that , I 'm sure . '' `` Ay , '' says I , `` but if he would give me an estate to live on , he should not lie with me , I assure you . '' `` Why , look you , madam ; if he would but give you enough to live easy upon , he should lie with me for it with all my heart . '' `` That 's a token , Amy , of inimitable kindness to me , '' said I , `` and I know how to value it ; but there 's more friendship than honesty in it , Amy . '' `` Oh , madam , '' says Amy , `` I 'd do anything to get you out of this sad condition ; as to honesty , I think honesty is out of the question when starving is the case . Are not we almost starved to death ? '' `` I am indeed , '' said I , `` and thou art for my sake ; but to be a whore , Amy ! '' and there I stopped . `` Dear madam , '' says Amy , `` if I will starve for your sake , I will be a whore or anything for your sake ; why , I would die for you if I were put to it . '' `` Why , that 's an excess of affection , Amy , '' said I , `` I never met with before ; I wish I may be ever in condition to make you some returns suitable . But , however , Amy , you shall not be a whore to him , to oblige him to be kind to me ; no , Amy , nor I wo n't be a whore to him , if he would give me much more than he is able to give me or do for me . '' `` Why , madam , '' says Amy , `` I do n't say I will go and ask him ; but I say , if he should promise to do so and so for you , and the condition was such that he would not serve you unless I would let him lie with me , he should lie with me as often as he would , rather than you should not have his assistance . But this is but talk , madam ; I do n't see any need of such discourse , and you are of opinion that there will be no need of it . '' `` Indeed so I am , Amy ; but , '' said I , `` if there was , I tell you again , I'd die before I would consent , or before you should consent for my sake . '' Hitherto I had not only preserved the virtue itself , but the virtuous inclination and resolution ; and had I kept myself there I had been happy , though I had perished of mere hunger ; for , without question , a woman ought rather to die than to prostitute her virtue and honour , let the temptation be what it will . But to return to my story ; he walked about the garden , which was , indeed , all in disorder , and overrun with weeds , because I had not been able to hire a gardener to do anything to it , no , not so much as to dig up ground enough to sow a few turnips and carrots for family use . After he had viewed it , he came in , and sent Amy to fetch a poor man , a gardener , that used to help our man-servant , and carried him into the garden , and ordered him to do several things in it , to put it into a little order ; and this took him up near an hour . By this time I had dressed me as well as I could ; for though I had good linen left still , yet I had but a poor head-dress , and no knots , but old fragments ; no necklace , no earrings ; all those things were gone long ago for mere bread . However , I was tight and clean , and in better plight than he had seen me in a great while , and he looked extremely pleased to see me so ; for , he said , I looked so disconsolate and so afflicted before , that it grieved him to see me ; and he bade me pluck up a good heart , for he hoped to put me in a condition to live in the world , and be beholden to nobody . I told him that was impossible , for I must be beholden to him for it , for all the friends I had in the world would not or could not do so much for me as that he spoke of `` Well , widow , '' says he ( so he called me , and so indeed I was in the worst sense that desolate word could be used in ) , `` if you are beholden to me , you shall be beholden to nobody else . '' By this time dinner was ready , and Amy came in to lay the cloth , and indeed it was happy there was none to dine but he and I , for I had but six plates left in the house , and but two dishes ; however , he knew how things were , and bade me make no scruple about bringing out what I had . He hoped to see me in a better plight . He did not come , he said , to be entertained , but to entertain me , and comfort and encourage me . Thus he went on , speaking so cheerfully to me , and such cheerful things , that it was a cordial to my very soul to hear him speak . Well , we went to dinner . I 'm sure I had not ate a good meal hardly in a twelvemonth , at least not of such a joint of meat as the loin of veal was . I ate , indeed , very heartily , and so did he , and he made me drink three or four glasses of wine ; so that , in short , my spirits were lifted up to a degree I had not been used to , and I was not only cheerful , but merry ; and so he pressed me to be . I told him I had a great deal of reason to be merry , seeing he had been so kind to me , and had given me hopes of recovering me from the worst circumstances that ever woman of any sort of fortune was sunk into ; that he could not but believe that what he had said to me was like life from the dead ; that it was like recovering one sick from the brink of the grave ; how I should ever make him a return any way suitable was what I had not yet had time to think of ; I could only say that I should never forget it while I had life , and should be always ready to acknowledge it . He said that was all he desired of me ; that his reward would be the satisfaction of having rescued me from misery ; that he found he was obliging one that knew what gratitude meant ; that he would make it his business to make me completely easy , first or last , if it lay in his power ; and in the meantime he bade me consider of anything that I thought he might do for me , for my advantage , and in order to make me perfectly easy . After we had talked thus , he bade me be cheerful . `` Come , '' says he , `` lay aside these melancholy things , and let us be merry . '' Amy waited at the table , and she smiled and laughed , and was so merry she could hardly contain it , for the girl loved me to an excess hardly to be described ; and it was such an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her mistress , that the wench was beside herself almost , and , as soon as dinner was over , Amy went upstairs , and put on her best clothes too , and came down dressed like a gentlewoman . We sat together talking of a thousand things -- of what had been , and what was to be -- all the rest of the day , and in the evening he took his leave of me , with a thousand expressions of kindness and tenderness and true affection to me , but offered not the least of what my maid Amy had suggested . At his going away he took me in his arms , protested an honest kindness to me ; said a thousand kind things to me , which I can not now recollect ; and , after kissing me twenty times or thereabouts , put a guinea into my hand , which , he said , was for my present supply , and told me that he would see me again before it was out ; also he gave Amy half-a-crown . When he was gone , `` Well , Amy , '' said I , `` are you convinced now that he is an honest as well as a true friend , and that there has been nothing , not the least appearance of anything , of what you imagined in his behaviour ? '' `` Yes , '' says Amy , `` I am , but I admire at it . He is such a friend as the world , sure , has not abundance of to show . '' `` I am sure , '' says I , `` he is such a friend as I have long wanted , and as I have as much need of as any creature in the world has or ever had . '' And , in short , I was so overcome with the comfort of it that I sat down and cried for joy a good while , as I had formerly cried for sorrow . Amy and I went to bed that night ( for Amy lay with me ) pretty early , but lay chatting almost all night about it , and the girl was so transported that she got up two or three times in the night and danced about the room in her shift ; in short , the girl was half distracted with the joy of it ; a testimony still of her violent affection for her mistress , in which no servant ever went beyond her . We heard no more of him for two days , but the third day he came again ; then he told me , with the same kindness , that he had ordered me a supply of household goods for the furnishing the house ; that , in particular , he had sent me back all the goods that he had seized for rent , which consisted , indeed , of the best of my former furniture . `` And now , '' says he , `` I 'll tell you what I have had in my head for you for your present supply , and that is , '' says he , `` that the house being well furnished , you shall let it out to lodgings for the summer gentry , '' says he , `` by which you will easily get a good comfortable subsistence , especially seeing you shall pay me no rent for two years , nor after neither , unless you can afford it . '' This was the first view I had of living comfortably indeed , and it was a very probable way , I must confess , seeing we had very good conveniences , six rooms on a floor , and three stories high . While he was laying down the scheme of my management , came a cart to the door with a load of goods , and an upholsterer 's man to put them up . They were chiefly the furniture of two rooms which he had carried away for his two years' rent , with two fine cabinets , and some pier-glasses out of the parlour , and several other valuable things . These were all restored to their places , and he told me he gave them me freely , as a satisfaction for the cruelty he had used me with before ; and the furniture of one room being finished and set up , he told me he would furnish one chamber for himself , and would come and be one of my lodgers , if I would give him leave . I told him he ought not to ask me leave , who had so much right to make himself welcome . So the house began to look in some tolerable figure , and clean ; the garden also , in about a fortnight 's work , began to look something less like a wilderness than it used to do ; and he ordered me to put up a bill for letting rooms , reserving one for himself , to come to as he saw occasion . When all was done to his mind , as to placing the goods , he seemed very well pleased , and we dined together again of his own providing ; and the upholsterer 's man gone , after dinner he took me by the hand . `` Come now , madam , '' says he , `` you must show me your house '' ( for he had a mind to see everything over again ) . `` No , sir , '' said I ; `` but I 'll go show you your house , if you please ; '' so we went up through all the rooms , and in the room which was appointed for himself Amy was doing something . `` Well , Amy , '' says he , `` I intend to lie with you to-morrow night . '' `` To-night if you please , sir , '' says Amy very innocently ; `` your room is quite ready . '' `` Well , Amy , '' says he , `` I am glad you are so willing . '' `` No , '' says Amy , `` I mean your chamber is ready to-night , '' and away she run out of the room , ashamed enough ; for the girl meant no harm , whatever she had said to me in private . However , he said no more then ; but when Amy was gone he walked about the room , and looked at everything , and taking me by the hand he kissed me , and spoke a great many kind , affectionate things to me indeed ; as of his measures for my advantage , and what he would do to raise me again in the world ; told me that my afflictions and the conduct I had shown in bearing them to such an extremity , had so engaged him to me that he valued me infinitely above all the women in the world ; that though he was under such engagements that he could not marry me ( his wife and he had been parted for some reasons , which make too long a story to intermix with mine ) , yet that he would be everything else that a woman could ask in a husband ; and with that he kissed me again , and took me in his arms , but offered not the least uncivil action to me , and told me he hoped I would not deny him all the favours he should ask , because he resolved to ask nothing of me but what it was fit for a woman of virtue and modesty , for such he knew me to be , to yield . I confess the terrible pressure of my former misery , the memory of which lay heavy upon my mind , and the surprising kindness with which he had delivered me , and , withal , the expectations of what he might still do for me , were powerful things , and made me have scarce the power to deny him anything he would ask . However , I told him thus , with an air of tenderness too , that he had done so much for me that I thought I ought to deny him nothing ; only I hoped and depended upon him that he would not take the advantage of the infinite obligations I was under to him , to desire anything of me the yielding to which would lay me lower in his esteem than I desired to be ; that as I took him to be a man of honour , so I knew he could not like me better for doing anything that was below a woman of honesty and good manners to do . He told me that he had done all this for me , without so much as telling me what kindness or real affection he had for me , that I might not be under any necessity of yielding to him in anything for want of bread ; and he would no more oppress my gratitude now than he would my necessity before , nor ask anything , supposing he would stop his favours or withdraw his kindness , if he was denied ; it was true , he said , he might tell me more freely his mind now than before , seeing I had let him see that I accepted his assistance , and saw that he was sincere in his design of serving me ; that he had gone thus far to show me that he was kind to me , but that now he would tell me that he loved me , and yet would demonstrate that his love was both honourable , and that what he should desire was what he might honestly ask and I might honestly grant . I answered that , within those two limitations , I was sure I ought to deny him nothing , and I should think myself not ungrateful only , but very unjust , if I should ; so he said no more , but I observed he kissed me more , and took me in his arms in a kind of familiar way , more than usual , and which once or twice put me in mind of my maid Amy 's words ; and yet , I must acknowledge , I was so overcome with his goodness to me in those many kind things he had done that I not only was easy at what he did and made no resistance , but was inclined to do the like , whatever he had offered to do . But he went no farther than what I have said , nor did he offer so much as to sit down on the bedside with me , but took his leave , said he loved me tenderly , and would convince me of it by such demonstrations as should be to my satisfaction . I told him I had a great deal of reason to believe him , that he was full master of the whole house and of me , as far as was within the bounds we had spoken of , which I believe he would not break , and asked him if he would not lodge there that night . He said he could not well stay that night , business requiring him in London , but added , smiling , that he would come the next day and take a night 's lodging with me . I pressed him to stay that night , and told him I should be glad a friend so valuable should be under the same roof with me ; and indeed I began at that time not only to be much obliged to him , but to love him too , and that in a manner that I had not been acquainted with myself . Oh ! let no woman slight the temptation that being generously delivered from trouble is to any spirit furnished with gratitude and just principles . This gentleman had freely and voluntarily delivered me from misery , from poverty , and rags ; he had made me what I was , and put me into a way to be even more than I ever was , namely , to live happy and pleased , and on his bounty I depended . What could I say to this gentleman when he pressed me to yield to him , and argued the lawfulness of it ? But of that in its place . I pressed him again to stay that night , and told him it was the first completely happy night that I had ever had in the house in my life , and I should be very sorry to have it be without his company , who was the cause and foundation of it all ; that we would be innocently merry , but that it could never be without him ; and , in short , I courted him so , that he said he could not deny me , but he would take his horse and go to London , do the business he had to do , which , it seems , was to pay a foreign bill that was due that night , and would else be protested , and that he would come back in three hours at farthest , and sup with me ; but bade me get nothing there , for since I was resolved to be merry , which was what he desired above all things , he would send me something from London . `` And we will make it a wedding supper , my dear , '' says he ; and with that word took me in his arms , and kissed me so vehemently that I made no question but he intended to do everything else that Amy had talked of . I started a little at the word wedding . `` What do ye mean , to call it by such a name ? '' says I ; adding , `` We will have a supper , but t'other is impossible , as well on your side as mine . '' He laughed . `` Well , '' says he , '' you shall call it what you will , but it may be the same thing , for I shall satisfy you it is not so impossible as you make it . '' `` I do n't understand you , '' said I . `` Have not I a husband and you a wife ? '' `` Well , well , '' says he , `` we will talk of that after supper ; '' so he rose up , gave me another kiss , and took his horse for London . This kind of discourse had fired my blood , I confess , and I knew not what to think of it . It was plain now that he intended to lie with me , but how he would reconcile it to a legal thing , like a marriage , that I could not imagine . We had both of us used Amy with so much intimacy , and trusted her with everything , having such unexampled instances of her fidelity , that he made no scruple to kiss me and say all these things to me before her ; nor had he cared one farthing , if I would have let him lie with me , to have had Amy there too all night . When he was gone , '' Well , Amy , '' says I , `` what will all this come to now ? I am all in a sweat at him . '' `` Come to , madam ? '' says Amy . `` I see what it will come to ; I must put you to bed to-night together . '' `` Why , you would not be so impudent , you jade you , '' says I , `` would you ? '' `` Yes , I would , '' says she , '' with all my heart , and think you both as honest as ever you were in your lives . '' `` What ails the slut to talk so ? '' said I . `` Honest ! How can it be honest ? '' `` Why , I 'll tell you , madam , '' says Amy ; `` I sounded it as soon as I heard him speak , and it is very true too ; he calls you widow , and such indeed you are ; for , as my master has left you so many years , he is dead , to be sure ; at least he is dead to you ; he is no husband . You are , and ought to be , free to marry who you will ; and his wife being gone from him , and refusing to lie with him , then he is a single man again as much as ever ; and though you can not bring the laws of the land to join you together , yet , one refusing to do the office of a wife , and the other of a husband , you may certainly take one another fairly . '' `` Nay , Amy , '' says I , `` if I could take him fairly , you may be sure I'd take him above all the men in the world ; it turned the very heart within me when I heard him say he loved me . How could it be otherwise , when you know what a condition I was in before , despised and trampled on by all the world ? I could have took him in my arms and kissed him as freely as he did me , if it had not been for shame . '' `` Ay , and all the rest too , '' says Amy , `` at the first word . I do n't see how you can think of denying him anything . Has he not brought you out of the devil 's clutches , brought you out of the blackest misery that ever poor lady was reduced to ? Can a woman deny such a man anything ? '' `` Nay , I do n't know what to do , Amy , '' says I . `` I hope he wo n't desire anything of that kind of me ; I hope he wo n't attempt it . If he does , I know not what to say to him . '' `` Not ask you ! '' says Amy . `` Depend upon it , he will ask you , and you will grant it too . I am sure my mistress is no fool . Come , pray , madam , let me go air you a clean shift ; do n't let him find you in foul linen the wedding-night . '' `` But that I know you to be a very honest girl , Amy , '' says I , `` you would make me abhor you . Why , you argue for the devil , as if you were one of his privy councillors . '' `` It 's no matter for that , madam , I say nothing but what I think . You own you love this gentleman , and he has given you sufficient testimony of his affection to you ; your conditions are alike unhappy , and he is of opinion that he may take another woman , his first wife having broke her honour , and living from him ; and that though the laws of the land will not allow him to marry formally , yet that he may take another woman into his arms , provided he keeps true to the other woman as a wife ; nay , he says it is usual to do so , and allowed by the custom of the place , in several countries abroad . And , I must own , I am of the same mind ; else it is in the power of a whore , after she has jilted and abandoned her husband , to confine him from the pleasure as well as convenience of a woman all the days of his life , which would be very unreasonable , and , as times go , not tolerable to all people ; and the like on your side , madam . '' Had I now had my senses about me , and had my reason not been overcome by the powerful attraction of so kind , so beneficent a friend ; had I consulted conscience and virtue , I should have repelled this Amy , however faithful and honest to me in other things , as a viper and engine of the devil . I ought to have remembered that neither he or I , either by the laws of God or man , could come together upon any other terms than that of notorious adultery . The ignorant jade 's argument , that he had brought me out of the hands of the devil , by which she meant the devil of poverty and distress , should have been a powerful motive to me not to plunge myself into the jaws of hell , and into the power of the real devil , in recompense for that deliverance . I should have looked upon all the good this man had done for me to have been the particular work of the goodness of Heaven , and that goodness should have moved me to a return of duty and humble obedience . I should have received the mercy thankfully , and applied it soberly , to the praise and honour of my Maker ; whereas , by this wicked course , all the bounty and kindness of this gentleman became a snare to me , was a mere bait to the devil's hook ; I received his kindness at the dear expense of body and soul , mortgaging faith , religion , conscience , and modesty for ( as I may call it ) a morsel of bread ; or , if you will , ruined my soul from a principle of gratitude , and gave myself up to the devil , to show myself grateful to my benefactor . I must do the gentleman that justice as to say I verily believe that he did nothing but what he thought was lawful ; and I must do that justice upon myself as to say I did what my own conscience convinced me , at the very time I did it , was horribly unlawful , scandalous , and abominable . But poverty was my snare ; dreadful poverty ! The misery I had been in was great , such as would make the heart tremble at the apprehensions of its return ; and I might appeal to any that has had any experience of the world , whether one so entirely destitute as I was of all manner of all helps or friends , either to support me or to assist me to support myself , could withstand the proposal ; not that I plead this as a justification of my conduct , but that it may move the pity even of those that abhor the crime . Besides this , I was young , handsome , and , with all the mortifications I had met with , was vain , and that not a little ; and , as it was a new thing , so it was a pleasant thing to be courted , caressed , embraced , and high professions of affection made to me , by a man so agreeable and so able to do me good . Add to this , that if I had ventured to disoblige this gentleman , I had no friend in the world to have recourse to ; I had no prospect -- no , not of a bit of bread ; I had nothing before me but to fall back into the same misery that I had been in before . Amy had but too much rhetoric in this cause ; she represented all those things in their proper colours ; she argued them all with her utmost skill ; and at last the merry jade , when she came to dress me , `` Look ye , madam , '' said she , `` if you wo n't consent , tell him you will do as Rachel did to Jacob , when she could have no children -- put her maid to bed to him ; tell him you can not comply with him , but there 's Amy , he may ask her the question ; she has promised me she wo n't deny you . '' `` And would you have me say so , Amy ? '' said I . `` No , madam ; but I would really have you do so . Besides , you are undone if you do not ; and if my doing it would save you from being undone , as I said before , he shall , if he will ; if he asks me , I wo n't deny him , not I ; hang me if I do , '' says Amy . `` Well , I know not what to do , '' says I to Amy . `` Do ! '' says Amy . `` Your choice is fair and plain . Here you may have a handsome , charming gentleman , be rich , live pleasantly and in plenty , or refuse him , and want a dinner , go in rags , live in tears ; in short , beg and starve . You know this is the case , madam , '' says Amy . `` I wonder how you can say you know not what to do . '' `` Well , Amy , '' says I , `` the case is as you say , and I think verily I must yield to him ; but then , '' said I , moved by conscience , `` do n't talk any more of your cant of its being lawful that I ought to marry again , and that he ought to marry again , and such stuff as that ; 't is all nonsense , '' says I , `` Amy , there 's nothing in it ; let me hear no more of that , for if I yield , 't is in vain to mince the matter , I am a whore , Amy ; neither better nor worse , I assure you . '' `` I do n't think so , madam , by no means , '' says Amy . `` I wonder how you can talk so ; '' and then she run on with her argument of the unreasonableness that a woman should be obliged to live single , or a man to live single , in such cases as before . `` Well , Amy , '' said I , `` come , let us dispute no more , for the longer I enter into that part , the greater my scruples will be ; but if I let it alone , the necessity of my present circumstances is such that I believe I shall yield to him , if he should importune me much about it ; but I should be glad he would not do it at all , but leave me as I am . '' `` As to that , madam , you may depend , '' says Amy , `` he expects to have you for his bedfellow to-night . I saw it plainly in his management all day ; and at last he told you so too , as plain , I think , as he could . '' `` Well , well , Amy , '' said I , `` I do n't know what to say ; if he will he must , I think ; I do n't know how to resist such a man , that has done so much for me . '' `` I do n't know how you should , '' says Amy . Thus Amy and I canvassed the business between us ; the jade prompted the crime which I had but too much inclination to commit , that is to say , not as a crime , for I had nothing of the vice in my constitution ; my spirits were far from being high , my blood had no fire in it to kindle the flame of desire ; but the kindness and good humour of the man and the dread of my own circumstances concurred to bring me to the point , and I even resolved , before he asked , to give up my virtue to him whenever he should put it to the question . In this I was a double offender , whatever he was , for I was resolved to commit the crime , knowing and owning it to be a crime ; he , if it was true as he said , was fully persuaded it was lawful , and in that persuasion he took the measures and used all the circumlocutions which I am going to speak of . About two hours after he was gone , came a Leadenhall basket-woman , with a whole load of good things for the mouth ( the particulars are not to the purpose ) , and brought orders to get supper by eight o'clock . However , I did not intend to begin to dress anything till I saw him ; and he gave me time enough , for he came before seven , so that Amy , who had gotten one to help her , got everything ready in time . We sat down to supper about eight , and were indeed very merry . Amy made us some sport , for she was a girl of spirit and wit , and with her talk she made us laugh very often , and yet the jade managed her wit with all the good manners imaginable . But to shorten the story . After supper he took me up into his chamber , where Amy had made a good fire , and there he pulled out a great many papers , and spread them upon a little table , and then took me by the hand , and after kissing me very much , he entered into a discourse of his circumstances and of mine , how they agreed in several things exactly ; for example , that I was abandoned of a husband in the prime of my youth and vigour , and he of a wife in his middle age ; how the end of marriage was destroyed by the treatment we had either of us received , and it would be very hard that we should be tied by the formality of the contract where the essence of it was destroyed . I interrupted him , and told him there was a vast difference between our circumstances , and that in the most essential part , namely , that he was rich , and I was poor ; that he was above the world , and I infinitely below it ; that his circumstances were very easy , mine miserable , and this was an inequality the most essential that could be imagined . `` As to that , my dear , '' says he , `` I have taken such measures as shall make an equality still ; '' and with that he showed me a contract in writing , wherein he engaged himself to me to cohabit constantly with me , to provide for me in all respects as a wife , and repeating in the preamble a long account of the nature and reason of our living together , and an obligation in the penalty of £7000 never to abandon me ; and at last showed me a bond for £500 , to be paid to me , or to my assigns , within three months after his death . He read over all these things to me , and then , in a most moving , affectionate manner , and in words not to be answered , he said , `` Now , my dear , is this not sufficient ? Can you object anything against it ? If not , as I believe you will not , then let us debate this matter no longer . '' With that he pulled out a silk purse , which had threescore guineas in it , and threw them into my lap , and concluded all the rest of his discourse with kisses and protestations of his love , of which indeed I had abundant proof . Pity human frailty , you that read of a woman reduced in her youth and prime to the utmost misery and distress , and raised again , as above , by the unexpected and surprising bounty of a stranger ; I say , pity her if she was not able , after all these things , to make any more resistance . However , I stood out a little longer still . I asked him how he could expect that I could come into a proposal of such consequence the very first time it was moved to me ; and that I ought , if I consented to it , to capitulate with him that he should never upbraid me with easiness and consenting too soon . He said no ; but , on the contrary , he would take it as a mark of the greatest kindness I could show him . Then he went on to give reasons why there was no occasion to use the ordinary ceremony of delay , or to wait a reasonable time of courtship , which was only to avoid scandal ; but , as this was private , it had nothing of that nature in it ; that he had been courting me some time by the best of courtship , viz. , doing acts of kindness to me ; and that he had given testimonies of his sincere affection to me by deeds , not by flattering trifles and the usual courtship of words , which were often found to have very little meaning ; that he took me , not as a mistress , but as his wife , and protested it was clear to him he might lawfully do it , and that I was perfectly at liberty , and assured me , by all that it was possible for an honest man to say , that he would treat me as his wife as long as he lived . In a word , he conquered all the little resistance I intended to make ; he protested he loved me above all the world , and begged I would for once believe him ; that he had never deceived me , and never would , but would make it his study to make my life comfortable and happy , and to make me forget the misery I had gone through . I stood still a while , and said nothing ; but seeing him eager for my answer , I smiled , and looking up at him , `` And must I , then , '' says I , `` say yes at first asking ? Must I depend upon your promise ? Why , then , '' said I , `` upon the faith of that promise , and in the sense of that inexpressible kindness you have shown me , you shall be obliged , and I will be wholly yours to the end of my life ; '' and with that I took his hand , which held me by the hand , and gave it a kiss . And thus , in gratitude for the favours I received from a man , was all sense of religion and duty to God , all regard to virtue and honour , given up at once , and we were to call one another man and wife , who , in the sense of the laws both of God and our country , were no more than two adulterers ; in short , a whore and a rogue . Nor , as I have said above , was my conscience silent in it , though it seems his was ; for I sinned with open eyes , and thereby had a double guilt upon me . As I always said , his notions were of another kind , and he either was before of the opinion , or argued himself into it now , that we were both free and might lawfully marry . But I was quite of another side -- nay , and my judgment was right , but my circumstances were my temptation ; the terrors behind me looked blacker than the terrors before me ; and the dreadful argument of wanting bread , and being run into the horrible distresses I was in before , mastered all my resolution , and I gave myself up as above . The rest of the evening we spent very agreeably to me ; he was perfectly good-humoured , and was at that time very merry . Then he made Amy dance with him , and I told him I would put Amy to bed to him . Amy said , with all her heart ; she never had been a bride in her life . In short , he made the girl so merry that , had he not been to lie with me the same night , I believe he would have played the fool with Amy for half-an-hour , and the girl would no more have refused him than I intended to do . Yet before , I had always found her a very modest wench as any I ever saw in all my life ; but , in short , the mirth of that night , and a few more such afterwards , ruined the girl 's modesty for ever , as shall appear by-and-by , in its place . So far does fooling and toying sometimes go that I know nothing a young woman has to be more cautious of ; so far had this innocent girl gone in jesting between her and I , and in talking that she would let him lie with her , if he would but be kinder to me , that at last she let him lie with her in earnest ; and so empty was I now of all principle , that I encouraged the doing it almost before my face . I say but too justly that I was empty of principle , because , as above , I had yielded to him , not as deluded to believe it lawful , but as overcome by his kindness , and terrified at the fear of my own misery if he should leave me . So with my eyes open , and with my conscience , as I may say , awake , I sinned , knowing it to be a sin , but having no power to resist . When this had thus made a hole in my heart , and I was come to such a height as to transgress against the light of my own conscience , I was then fit for any wickedness , and conscience left off speaking where it found it could not be heard . But to return to our story . Having consented , as above , to his proposal , we had not much more to do . He gave me my writings , and the bond for my maintenance during his life , and for five hundred pounds after his death . And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards , that two years after we were thus , as he called it , married , he made his will , and gave me a thousand pounds more , and all my household stuff , plate , & c. , which was considerable too . Amy put us to bed , and my new friend -- I can not call him husband -- was so well pleased with Amy for her fidelity and kindness to me that he paid her all the arrear of her wages that I owed her , and gave her five guineas over ; and had it gone no farther , Amy had richly deserved what she had , for never was a maid so true to her mistress in such dreadful circumstances as I was in . Nor was what followed more her own fault than mine , who led her almost into it at first , and quite into it at last ; and this may be a farther testimony what a hardness of crime I was now arrived to , which was owing to the conviction , that was from the beginning upon me , that I was a whore , not a wife ; nor could I ever frame my mouth to call him husband or to say `` my husband '' when I was speaking of him . We lived , surely , the most agreeable life , the grand exception only excepted , that ever two lived together . He was the most obliging , gentlemanly man , and the most tender of me , that ever woman gave herself up to . Nor was there ever the least interruption to our mutual kindness , no , not to the last day of his life . But I must bring Amy 's disaster in at once , that I may have done with her . Amy was dressing me one morning , for now I had two maids , and Amy was my chambermaid . `` Dear madam , '' says Amy , `` what ! a'nt you with child yet ? '' `` No , Amy , '' says I ; `` nor any sign of it . '' `` Law , madam ! '' says Amy , `` what have you been doing ? Why , you have been married a year and a half . I warrant you master would have got me with child twice in that time . '' `` It may be so , Amy , '' says I . `` Let him try , ca n't you ? '' `` No , '' says Amy ; `` you 'll forbid it now . Before , I told you he should , with all my heart ; but I wo n't now , now he 's all your own . '' `` Oh , '' says I , `` Amy , I 'll freely give you my consent . It will be nothing at all to me . Nay , I 'll put you to bed to him myself one night or other , if you are willing . '' `` No , madam , no , '' says Amy , `` not now he 's yours . '' `` Why , you fool you , '' says I , `` do n't I tell you I 'll put you to bed to him myself ? '' `` Nay , nay , '' says Amy , `` if you put me to bed to him , that's another case ; I believe I shall not rise again very soon . '' `` I 'll venture that , Amy , '' says I . After supper that night , and before we were risen from table , I said to him , Amy being by , `` Hark ye , Mr. -- -- , do you know that you are to lie with Amy to-night ? '' `` No , not I , '' says he ; but turns to Amy , `` Is it so , Amy ? '' says he . `` No , sir , '' says she . `` Nay , do n't say no , you fool ; did not I promise to put you to bed to him ? '' But the girl said `` No , '' still , and it passed off . At night , when we came to go to bed , Amy came into the chamber to undress me , and her master slipped into bed first ; then I began , and told him all that Amy had said about my not being with child , and of her being with child twice in that time . `` Ay , Mrs. Amy , '' says he , `` I believe so too . Come hither , and , we 'll try . '' But Amy did not go . `` Go , you fool , '' says I , `` ca n't you ? I freely give you both leave . '' But Amy would not go . `` Nay , you whore , '' says I , `` you said , if I would put you to bed , you would with all your heart . '' And with that I sat her down , pulled off her stockings and shoes , and all her clothes piece by piece , and led her to the bed to him . `` Here , '' says I , `` try what you can do with your maid Amy . '' She pulled back a little , would not let me pull off her clothes at first , but it was hot weather , and she had not many clothes on , and particularly no stays on ; and at last , when she saw I was in earnest , she let me do what I would . So I fairly stripped her , and then I threw open the bed and thrust her in . I need say no more . This is enough to convince anybody that I did not think him my husband , and that I had cast off all principle and all modesty , and had effectually stifled conscience . Amy , I dare say , began now to repent , and would fain have got out of bed again ; but he said to her , `` Nay , Amy , you see your mistress has put you to bed ; 't is all her doing ; you must blame her . '' So he held her fast , and the wench being naked in the bed with him , it was too late to look back , so she lay still and let him do what he would with her . Had I looked upon myself as a wife , you can not suppose I would have been willing to have let my husband lie with my maid , much less before my face , for I stood by all the while ; but as I thought myself a whore , I can not say but that it was something designed in my thoughts that my maid should be a whore too , and should not reproach me with it . Amy , however , less vicious than I , was grievously out of sorts the next morning , and cried and took on most vehemently , that she was ruined and undone , and there was no pacifying her ; she was a whore , a slut , and she was undone ! undone ! and cried almost all day . I did all I could to pacify her . `` A whore ! '' says I . `` Well , and am not I a whore as well as you ? '' `` No , no , '' says Amy ; `` no , you are not , for you are married . '' `` Not I , Amy , '' says I ; `` I do not pretend to it . He may marry you to-morrow , if he will , for anything I could do to hinder it . I am not married . I do not look upon it as anything . '' Well , all did not pacify Amy , but she cried two or three days about it ; but it wore off by degrees . But the case differed between Amy and her master exceedingly ; for Amy retained the same kind temper she always had ; but , on the contrary , he was quite altered , for he hated her heartily , and could , I believe , have killed her after it , and he told me so , for he thought this a vile action ; whereas what he and I had done he was perfectly easy in , thought it just , and esteemed me as much his wife as if we had been married from our youth , and had neither of us known any other ; nay , he loved me , I believe , as entirely as if I had been the wife of his youth . Nay , he told me it was true , in one sense , that he had two wives , but that I was the wife of his affection , the other the wife of his aversion . I was extremely concerned at the aversion he had taken to my maid Amy , and used my utmost skill to get it altered ; for though he had , indeed , debauched the wench , I knew that I was the principal occasion of it ; and as he was the best-humoured man in the world , I never gave him over till I prevailed with him to be easy with her , and as I was now become the devil 's agent , to make others as wicked as myself , I brought him to lie with her again several times after that , till at last , as the poor girl said , so it happened , and she was really with child . She was terribly concerned at it , and so was he too . `` Come , my dear , '' says I , `` when Rachel put her handmaid to bed to Jacob , she took the children as her own . Do n't be uneasy ; I 'll take the child as my own . Had not I a hand in the frolic of putting her to bed to you ? It was my fault as much as yours . '' So I called Amy , and encouraged her too , and told her that I would take care of the child and her too , and added the same argument to her . `` For , '' says I , `` Amy , it was all my fault . Did not I drag your clothes off your back , and put you to bed to him ? '' Thus I , that had , indeed , been the cause of all the wickedness between them , encouraged them both , when they had any remorse about it , and rather prompted them to go on with it than to repent it . When Amy grew big she went to a place I had provided for her , and the neighbours knew nothing but that Amy and I was parted . She had a fine child indeed , a daughter , and we had it nursed ; and Amy came again in about half a year to live with her old mistress ; but neither my gentleman , or Amy either , cared for playing that game over again ; for , as he said , the jade might bring him a houseful of children to keep . We lived as merrily and as happily after this as could be expected , considering our circumstances ; I mean as to the pretended marriage , & c. ; and as to that , my gentleman had not the least concern about him for it . But as much as I was hardened , and that was as much as I believe ever any wicked creature was , yet I could not help it , there was and would be hours of intervals and of dark reflections which came involuntarily in , and thrust in sighs into the middle of all my songs ; and there would be sometimes a heaviness of heart which intermingled itself with all my joy , and which would often fetch a tear from my eye . And let others pretend what they will , I believe it impossible to be otherwise with anybody . There can be no substantial satisfaction in a life of known wickedness ; conscience will , and does often , break in upon them at particular times , let them do what they can to prevent it . But I am not to preach , but to relate ; and whatever loose reflections were , and how often soever those dark intervals came on , I did my utmost to conceal them from him ; ay , and to suppress and smother them too in myself ; and , to outward appearance , we lived as cheerfully and agreeably as it was possible for any couple in the world to live . After I had thus lived with him something above two years , truly I found myself with child too . My gentleman was mightily pleased at it , and nothing could be kinder than he was in the preparations he made for me , and for my lying-in , which was , however , very private , because I cared for as little company as possible ; nor had I kept up my neighbourly acquaintance , so that I had nobody to invite upon such an occasion . I was brought to bed very well ( of a daughter too , as well as Amy ) , but the child died at about six weeks old , so all that work was to do over again -- that is to say , the charge , the expense , the travail , & c. The next year I made him amends , and brought him a son , to his great satisfaction . It was a charming child , and did very well . After this my husband , as he called himself , came to me one evening , and told me he had a very difficult thing happened to him , which he knew not what to do in , or how to resolve about , unless I would make him easy ; this was , that his occasions required him to go over to France for about two months . `` Well , my dear , '' says I , `` and how shall I make you easy ? '' `` Why , by consenting to let me go , '' says he ; `` upon which condition , I'll tell you the occasion of my going , that you may judge of the necessity there is for it on my side . '' Then , to make me easy in his going , he told me he would make his will before he went , which should be to my full satisfaction . I told him the last part was so kind that I could not decline the first part , unless he would give me leave to add that , if it was not for putting him to an extraordinary expense , I would go over along with him . He was so pleased with this offer that he told me he would give me full satisfaction for it , and accept of it too ; so he took me to London with him the next day , and there he made his will , and showed it to me , and sealed it before proper witnesses , and then gave it to me to keep . In this will he gave a thousand pounds to a person that we both knew very well , in trust , to pay it , with the interest from the time of his decease , to me or my assigns ; then he willed the payment of my jointure , as he called it , viz. , his bond of five hundred pounds after his death ; also , he gave me all my household stuff , plate , & c. This was a most engaging thing for a man to do to one under my circumstances ; and it would have been hard , as I told him , to deny him anything , or to refuse to go with him anywhere . So we settled everything as well as we could , left Amy in charge with the house , and for his other business , which was in jewels , he had two men he intrusted , who he had good security for , and who managed for him , and corresponded with him . Things being thus concerted , we went away to France , arrived safe at Calais , and by easy journeys came in eight days more to Paris , where we lodged in the house of an English merchant of his acquaintance , and was very courteously entertained . My gentleman 's business was with some persons of the first rank , and to whom he had sold some jewels of very good value , and received a great sum of money in specie ; and , as he told me privately , he gained three thousand pistoles by his bargain , but would not suffer the most intimate friend he had there to know what he had received ; for it is not so safe a thing in Paris to have a great sum of money in keeping as it might be in London . We made this journey much longer than we intended , and my gentleman sent for one of his managers in London to come over to us in Paris with some diamonds , and sent him back to London again to fetch more . Then other business fell into his hands so unexpectedly that I began to think we should take up our constant residence there , which I was not very averse to , it being my native country , and I spoke the language perfectly well . So we took a good house in Paris , and lived very well there ; and I sent for Amy to come over to me , for I lived gallantly , and my gentleman was two or three times going to keep me a coach , but I declined it , especially at Paris , but as they have those conveniences by the day there , at a certain rate , I had an equipage provided for me whenever I pleased , and I lived here in a very good figure , and might have lived higher if I pleased . But in the middle of all this felicity a dreadful disaster befell me , which entirely unhinged all my affairs , and threw me back into the same state of life that I was in before ; with this one happy exception , however , that whereas before I was poor , even to misery , now I was not only provided for , but very rich . My gentleman had the name in Paris for a rich man , and indeed he was so , though not so immensely rich as people imagined ; but that which was fatal to him was , that he generally carried a shagreen case in his pocket , especially when he went to court , or to the houses of any of the princes of the blood , in which he had jewels of very great value . It happened one day that , being to go to Versailles to wait upon the Prince of -- -- , he came up into my chamber in the morning , and laid out his jewel-case , because he was not going to show any jewels , but to get a foreign bill accepted , which he had received from Amsterdam ; so , when he gave me the case , he said , `` My dear , I think I need not carry this with me , because it may be I may not come back till night , and it is too much to venture . '' I returned , `` Then , my dear , you sha n't go . '' `` Why ? '' says he . `` Because , as they are too much for you , so you are too much for me to venture , and you shall not go , unless you will promise me not to stay so as to come back in the night . '' `` I hope there 's no danger , '' said he , `` seeing that I have nothing about me of any value ; and therefore , lest I should , take that too , '' says he , and gives me his gold watch and a rich diamond which he had in a ring , and always wore on his finger . `` Well , but , my dear , '' says I , `` you make me more uneasy now than before ; for if you apprehend no danger , why do you use this caution ? and if you apprehend there is danger , why do you go at all ? '' `` There is no danger , '' says he , `` if I do not stay late , and I do not design to do so . '' `` Well , but promise me , then , that you wo n't , '' says I , `` or else I can not let you go . '' `` I wo n't indeed , my dear , '' says he , `` unless I am obliged to it . I assure you I do not intend it ; but if I should , I am not worth robbing now , for I have nothing about me but about six pistoles in my little purse and that little ring , '' showing me a small diamond ring , worth about ten or twelve pistoles , which he put upon his finger , in the room of the rich one he usually wore . [ Illustration : THE JEWELLER IS ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR VERSAILLES _And gives me his gold watch and a rich diamond which he had in a ring , and always wore on his finger_ ] I still pressed him not to stay late , and he said he would not . `` But if I am kept late , '' says he , `` beyond my expectation , I 'll stay all night , and come next morning . '' This seemed a very good caution ; but still my mind was very uneasy about him , and I told him so , and entreated him not to go . I told him I did not know what might be the reason , but that I had a strange terror upon my mind about his going , and that if he did go , I was persuaded some harm would attend him . He smiled , and returned , '' Well , my dear , if it should be so , you are now richly provided for ; all that I have here I give to you . '' And with that he takes up the casket or case , `` Here , '' says he , `` hold your hand ; there is a good estate for you in this case ; if anything happens to me 't is all your own . I give it you for yourself ; '' and with that he put the casket , the fine ring , and his gold watch all into my hands , and the key of his scrutoire besides , adding , `` And in my scrutoire there is some money ; it is all your own . '' I stared at him as if I was frighted , for I thought all his face looked like a death's-head ; and then immediately I thought I perceived his head all bloody , and then his clothes looked bloody too , and immediately it all went off , and he looked as he really did . Immediately I fell a-crying , and hung about him . `` My dear , '' said I , `` I am frighted to death ; you shall not go . Depend upon it some mischief will befall you . '' I did not tell him how my vapourish fancy had represented him to me ; that , I thought , was not proper . Besides , he would only have laughed at me , and would have gone away with a jest about it ; but I pressed him seriously not to go that day , or , if he did , to promise me to come home to Paris again by daylight . He looked a little graver then than he did before , told me he was not apprehensive of the least danger , but if there was , he would either take care to come in the day , or , as he had said before , would stay all night . But all these promises came to nothing , for he was set upon in the open day and robbed by three men on horseback , masked , as he went ; and one of them , who , it seems , rifled him while the rest stood to stop the coach , stabbed him into the body with a sword , so that he died immediately . He had a footman behind the coach , who they knocked down with the stock or butt-end of a carbine . They were supposed to kill him because of the disappointment they met with in not getting his case or casket of diamonds , which they knew he carried about him ; and this was supposed because , after they had killed him , they made the coachman drive out of the road a long way over the heath , till they came to a convenient place , where they pulled him out of the coach and searched his clothes more narrowly than they could do while he was alive . But they found nothing but his little ring , six pistoles , and the value of about seven livres in small moneys . This was a dreadful blow to me , though I can not say I was so surprised as I should otherwise have been , for all the while he was gone my mind was oppressed with the weight of my own thoughts , and I was as sure that I should never see him any more that I think nothing could be like it . The impression was so strong that I think nothing could make so deep a wound that was imaginary ; and I was so dejected and disconsolate that , when I received the news of his disaster , there was no room for any extraordinary alteration in me . I had cried all that day , ate nothing , and only waited , as I might say , to receive the dismal news , which I had brought to me about five o'clock in the afternoon . I was in a strange country , and , though I had a pretty many acquaintances , had but very few friends that I could consult on this occasion . All possible inquiry was made after the rogues that had been thus barbarous , but nothing could be heard of them ; nor was it possible that the footman could make any discovery of them by his description , for they knocked him down immediately , so that he knew nothing of what was done afterwards . The coachman was the only man that could say anything , and all his account amounted to no more than this , that one of them had soldier 's clothes , but he could not remember the particulars of his mounting , so as to know what regiment he belonged to ; and as to their faces , that he could know nothing of , because they had all of them masks on . I had him buried as decently as the place would permit a Protestant stranger to be buried , and made some of the scruples and difficulties on that account easy by the help of money to a certain person , who went impudently to the curate of the parish of St. Sulpitius , in Paris , and told him that the gentleman that was killed was a Catholic ; that the thieves had taken from him a cross of gold , set with diamonds , worth six thousand livres ; that his widow was a Catholic , and had sent by him sixty crowns to the church of -- -- , for masses to be said for the repose of his soul . Upon all which , though not one word was true , he was buried with all the ceremonies of the Roman Church . I think I almost cried myself to death for him , for I abandoned myself to all the excesses of grief ; and indeed I loved him to a degree inexpressible ; and considering what kindness he had shown me at first , and how tenderly he had used me to the last , what could I do less ? Then the manner of his death was terrible and frightful to me , and , above all , the strange notices I had of it . I had never pretended to the second-sight , or anything of that kind , but certainly , if any one ever had such a thing , I had it at this time , for I saw him as plainly in all those terrible shapes as above ; first , as a skeleton , not dead only , but rotten and wasted ; secondly , as killed , and his face bloody ; and , thirdly , his clothes bloody , and all within the space of one minute , or indeed of a very few moments . These things amazed me , and I was a good while as one stupid . However , after some time I began to recover , and look into my affairs . I had the satisfaction not to be left in distress , or in danger of poverty . On the contrary , besides what he had put into my hands fairly in his lifetime , which amounted to a very considerable value , I found above seven hundred pistoles in gold in his scrutoire , of which he had given me the key ; and I found foreign bills accepted for about twelve thousand livres ; so that , in a word , I found myself possessed of almost ten thousand pounds sterling in a very few days after the disaster . The first thing I did upon this occasion was to send a letter to my maid , as I still called her , Amy , wherein I gave her an account of my disaster , how my husband , as she called him ( for I never called him so ) , was murdered ; and as I did not know how his relations , or his wife's friends might act upon that occasion , I ordered her to convey away all the plate , linen , and other things of value , and to secure them in a person 's hands that I directed her to , and then to sell or dispose of the furniture of the house , if she could , and so , without acquainting anybody with the reason of her going , withdraw ; sending notice to his head manager at London that the house was quitted by the tenant , and they might come and take possession of it for the executors . Amy was so dexterous , and did her work so nimbly , that she gutted the house , and sent the key to the said manager , almost as soon as he had notice of the misfortune that befell their master . Upon their receiving the surprising news of his death , the head manager came over to Paris , and came to the house . I made no scruple of calling myself Madame -- -- , the widow of Monsieur -- -- , the English jeweller . And as I spoke French naturally , I did not let him know but that I was his wife , married in France , and that I had not heard that he had any wife in England , but pretended to be surprised , and exclaim against him for so base an action ; and that I had good friends in Poictou , where I was born , who would take care to have justice done me in England out of his estate . I should have observed that , as soon as the news was public of a man being murdered , and that he was a jeweller , fame did me the favour as to publish presently that he was robbed of his casket of jewels , which he always carried about him . I confirmed this , among my daily lamentations for his disaster , and added that he had with him a fine diamond ring , which he was known to wear frequently about him , valued at one hundred pistoles , a gold watch , and a great quantity of diamonds of inestimable value in his casket , which jewels he was carrying to the Prince of -- -- , to show some of them to him ; and the prince owned that he had spoken to him to bring some such jewels , to let him see them . But I sorely repented this part afterward , as you shall hear . This rumour put an end to all inquiry after his jewels , his ring , or his watch ; and as for the seven hundred pistoles , that I secured . For the bills which were in hand , I owned I had them , but that , as I said I brought my husband thirty thousand livres portion , I claimed the said bills , which came to not above twelve thousand livres , for my _amende_ ; and this , with the plate and the household stuff , was the principal of all his estate which they could come at . As to the foreign bill which he was going to Versailles to get accepted , it was really lost with him ; but his manager , who had remitted the bill to him , by way of Amsterdam , bringing over the second bill , the money was saved , as they call it , which would otherwise have been also gone ; the thieves who robbed and murdered him were , to be sure , afraid to send anybody to get the bill accepted , for that would undoubtedly have discovered them . By this time my maid Amy was arrived , and she gave me an account of her management , and how she had secured everything , and that she had quitted the house , and sent the key to the head manager of his business , and let me know how much she had made of everything very punctually and honestly . I should have observed , in the account of his dwelling with me so long at -- -- , that he never passed for anything there but a lodger in the house ; and though he was landlord , that did not alter the case . So that at his death , Amy coming to quit the house and give them the key , there was no affinity between that and the case of their master who was newly killed . I got good advice at Paris from an eminent lawyer , a counsellor of the Parliament there , and laying my case before him , he directed me to make a process in dower upon the estate , for making good my new fortune upon matrimony , which accordingly I did ; and , upon the whole , the manager went back to England well satisfied that he had gotten the unaccepted bill of exchange , which was for two thousand five hundred pounds , with some other things , which together amounted to seventeen thousand livres ; and thus I got rid of him . I was visited with great civility on this sad occasion of the loss of my husband , as they thought him , by a great many ladies of quality . And the Prince of -- -- , to whom it was reported he was carrying the jewels , sent his gentleman with a very handsome compliment of condolence to me ; and his gentleman , whether with or without order , hinted as if his Highness did intend to have visited me himself , but that some accident , which he made a long story of , had prevented him . By the concourse of ladies and others that thus came to visit me , I began to be much known ; and as I did not forget to set myself out with all possible advantage , considering the dress of a widow , which in those days was a most frightful thing ; I say , as I did thus from my own vanity , for I was not ignorant that I was very handsome ; I say , on this account I was soon made very public , and was known by the name of _La belle veufeu de Poictou_ , or the pretty widow of Poictou . As I was very well pleased to see myself thus handsomely used in my affliction , it soon dried up all my tears ; and though I appeared as a widow , yet , as we say in England , it was of a widow comforted . I took care to let the ladies see that I knew how to receive them ; that I was not at a loss how to behave to any of them ; and , in short , I began to be very popular there . But I had an occasion afterwards which made me decline that kind of management , as you shall hear presently . About four days after I had received the compliments of condolence from the Prince -- -- , the same gentleman he had sent before came to tell me that his Highness was coming to give me a visit . I was indeed surprised at that , and perfectly at a loss how to behave . However , as there was no remedy , I prepared to receive him as well as I could . It was not many minutes after but he was at the door , and came in , introduced by his own gentleman , as above , and after by my woman Amy . He treated me with abundance of civility , and condoled handsomely on the loss of my husband , and likewise the manner of it . He told me he understood he was coming to Versailles to himself , to show him some jewels ; that it was true that he had discoursed with him about jewels , but could not imagine how any villains should hear of his coming at that time with them ; that he had not ordered him to attend with them at Versailles , but told him that he would come to Paris by such a day , so that he was no way accessory to the disaster . I told him gravely I knew very well that all his Highness had said of that part was true ; that these villains knew his profession , and knew , no doubt , that he always carried a casket of jewels about him , and that he always wore a diamond ring on his finger worth a hundred pistoles , which report had magnified to five hundred ; and that , if he had been going to any other place , it would have been the same thing . After this his Highness rose up to go , and told me he had resolved , however , to make me some reparation ; and with these words put a silk purse into my hand with a hundred pistoles , and told me he would make me a farther compliment of a small pension , which his gentleman would inform me of . You may be sure I behaved with a due sense of so much goodness , and offered to kneel to kiss his hand ; but he took me up and saluted me , and sat down again ( though before he made as if he was going away ) , making me sit down by him . He then began to talk with me more familiarly ; told me he hoped I was not left in bad circumstances ; that Mr. -- -- was reputed to be very rich , and that he had gained lately great sums by some jewels , and he hoped , he said , that I had still a fortune agreeable to the condition I had lived in before . I replied , with some tears , which , I confess , were a little forced , that I believed , if Mr. -- -- had lived , we should have been out of danger of want , but that it was impossible to estimate the loss which I had sustained , besides that of the life of my husband ; that , by the opinion of those that knew something of his affairs , and of what value the jewels were which he intended to have shown to his Highness , he could not have less about him than the value of a hundred thousand livres ; that it was a fatal blow to me , and to his whole family , especially that they should be lost in such a manner . His Highness returned , with an air of concern , that he was very sorry for it ; but he hoped , if I settled in Paris , I might find ways to restore my fortune ; at the same time he complimented me upon my being very handsome , as he was pleased to call it , and that I could not fail of admirers . I stood up and humbly thanked his Highness , but told him I had no expectations of that kind ; that I thought I should be obliged to go over to England , to look after my husband 's effects there , which , I was told , were considerable , but that I did not know what justice a poor stranger would get among them ; and as for Paris , my fortune being so impaired , I saw nothing before me but to go back to Poictou to my friends , where some of my relations , I hoped , might do something for me , and added that one of my brothers was an abbot at -- -- , near Poictiers . He stood up , and taking me by the hand , led me to a large looking-glass , which made up the pier in the front of the parlour . `` Look there , madam , '' said he ; `` is it fit that that face '' ( pointing to my figure in the glass ) '' should go back to Poictou ? No , madam , '' says he ; `` stay and make some gentleman of quality happy , that may , in return , make you forget all your sorrows ; '' and with that he took me in his arms , and kissing me twice , told me he would see me again , but with less ceremony . Some little time after this , but the same day , his gentleman came to me again , and with great ceremony and respect , delivered me a black box tied with a scarlet riband and sealed with a noble coat-of-arms , which , I suppose , was the prince 's . There was in it a grant from his Highness , or an assignment -- I know not which to call it -- with a warrant to his banker to pay me two thousand livres a year during my stay in Paris , as the widow of Monsieur -- -- , the jeweller , mentioning the horrid murder of my late husband as the occasion of it , as above . I received it with great submission , and expressions of being infinitely obliged to his master , and of my showing myself on all occasions his Highness 's most obedient servant ; and after giving my most humble duty to his Highness , with the utmost acknowledgments of the obligation , & c. , I went to a little cabinet , and taking out some money , which made a little sound in taking it out , offered to give him five pistoles . He drew back , but with the greatest respect , and told me he humbly thanked me , but that he durst not take a farthing ; that his Highness would take it so ill of him , he was sure he would never see his face more ; but that he would not fail to acquaint his Highness what respect I had offered ; and added , `` I assure you , madam , you are more in the good graces of my master , the Prince of -- -- , than you are aware of ; and I believe you will hear more of him . '' Now I began to understand him , and resolved , if his Highness did come again , he should see me under no disadvantages , if I could help it . I told him , if his Highness did me the honour to see me again , I hoped he would not let me be so surprised as I was before ; that I would be glad to have some little notice of it , and would be obliged to him if he would procure it me . He told me he was very sure that when his Highness intended to visit me he should be sent before to give me notice of it , and that he would give me as much warning of it as possible . He came several times after this on the same errand , that is , about the settlement , the grant requiring several things yet to be done for making it payable without going every time to the prince again for a fresh warrant . The particulars of this part I did not understand ; but as soon as it was finished , which was above two months , the gentleman came one afternoon , and said his Highness designed to visit me in the evening , but desired to be admitted without ceremony . I prepared not my rooms only , but myself ; and when he came in there was nobody appeared in the house but his gentleman and my maid Amy ; and of her I bid the gentleman acquaint his Highness that she was an Englishwoman , that she did not understand a word of French , and that she was one also that might be trusted . When he came into my room , I fell down at his feet before he could come to salute me , and with words that I had prepared , full of duty and respect , thanked him for his bounty and goodness to a poor , desolate woman , oppressed under the weight of so terrible a disaster ; and refused to rise till he would allow me the honour to kiss his hand . `` _Levez vous donc_ , '' says the prince , taking me in his arms ; `` I design more favours for you than this trifle ; '' and going on , he added , `` You shall for the future find a friend where you did not look for it , and I resolve to let you see how kind I can be to one who is to me the most agreeable creature on earth . '' I was dressed in a kind of half mourning , had turned off my weeds , and my head , though I had yet no ribands or lace , was so dressed as failed not to set me out with advantage enough , for I began to understand his meaning ; and the prince professed I was the most beautiful creature on earth . `` And where have I lived , '' says he , `` and how ill have I been served , that I should never till now be showed the finest woman in France ! '' This was the way in all the world the most likely to break in upon my virtue , if I had been mistress of any ; for I was now become the vainest creature upon earth , and particularly of my beauty , which as other people admired , so I became every day more foolishly in love with myself than before . He said some very kind things to me after this , and sat down with me for an hour or more , when , getting up and calling his gentleman by his name , he threw open the door : `` _Au boire_ , '' says he ; upon which his gentleman immediately brought up a little table covered with a fine damask cloth , the table no bigger than he could bring in his two hands , but upon it was set two decanters , one of champagne and the other of water , six silver plates , and a service of fine sweetmeats in fine china dishes , on a set of rings standing up about twenty inches high , one above another",The Fortunate Mistress

A Last Retrospect PREFACE TO 1850 EDITION I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this Book , in the first sensations of having finished it , to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require . My interest in it , is so recent and strong ; and my mind is so divided between pleasure and regret -- pleasure in the achievement of a long design , regret in the separation from many companions -- that I am in danger of wearying the reader whom I love , with personal confidences , and private emotions . Besides which , all that I could say of the Story , to any purpose , I have endeavoured to say in it . It would concern the reader little , perhaps , to know , how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years ’ imaginative task ; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world , when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever . Yet , I have nothing else to tell ; unless , indeed , I were to confess ( which might be of less moment still ) that no one can ever believe this Narrative , in the reading , more than I have believed it in the writing . Instead of looking back , therefore , I will look forward . I can not close this Volume more agreeably to myself , than with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month , and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield , and made me happy . London , October , 1850 . My interest in it was so recent and strong , and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regret -- pleasure in the achievement of a long design , regret in the separation from many companions -- that I was in danger of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private emotions . Besides which , all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose , I had endeavoured to say in it . It would concern the reader little , perhaps , to know how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years ’ imaginative task ; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world , when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever . Yet , I had nothing else to tell ; unless , indeed , I were to confess ( which might be of less moment still ) , that no one can ever believe this Narrative , in the reading , more than I believed it in the writing . So true are these avowals at the present day , that I can now only take the reader into one confidence more . Of all my books , I like this the best . It will be easily believed that I am a fond parent to every child of my fancy , and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as I love them . But , like many fond parents , I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child . And his name is DAVID COPPERFIELD . 1869 THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE OF DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER CHAPTER 1 . I AM BORN Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life , or whether that station will be held by anybody else , these pages must show . To begin my life with the beginning of my life , I record that I was born ( as I have been informed and believe ) on a Friday , at twelve o ’ clock at night . It was remarked that the clock began to strike , and I began to cry , simultaneously . In consideration of the day and hour of my birth , it was declared by the nurse , and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted , first , that I was destined to be unlucky in life ; and secondly , that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits ; both these gifts inevitably attaching , as they believed , to all unlucky infants of either gender , born towards the small hours on a Friday night . I need say nothing here , on the first head , because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result . On the second branch of the question , I will only remark , that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby , I have not come into it yet . But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property ; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it , he is heartily welcome to keep it . I was born with a caul , which was advertised for sale , in the newspapers , at the low price of fifteen guineas . Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time , or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets , I don ’ t know ; all I know is , that there was but one solitary bidding , and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business , who offered two pounds in cash , and the balance in sherry , but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain . Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss -- for as to sherry , my poor dear mother ’ s own sherry was in the market then -- and ten years afterwards , the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country , to fifty members at half-a-crown a head , the winner to spend five shillings . I was present myself , and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused , at a part of myself being disposed of in that way . The caul was won , I recollect , by an old lady with a hand-basket , who , very reluctantly , produced from it the stipulated five shillings , all in halfpence , and twopence halfpenny short -- as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic , to endeavour without any effect to prove to her . It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there , that she was never drowned , but died triumphantly in bed , at ninety-two . I have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea ( to which she was extremely partial ) she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ‘ meandering ’ about the world . It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences , tea perhaps included , resulted from this objectionable practice . She always returned , with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection , ‘ Let us have no meandering. ’ Not to meander myself , at present , I will go back to my birth . I was born at Blunderstone , in Suffolk , or ‘ there by ’ , as they say in Scotland . I was a posthumous child . My father ’ s eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened on it . There is something strange to me , even now , in the reflection that he never saw me ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard , and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night , when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle , and the doors of our house were -- almost cruelly , it seemed to me sometimes -- bolted and locked against it . An aunt of my father ’ s , and consequently a great-aunt of mine , of whom I shall have more to relate by and by , was the principal magnate of our family . Miss Trotwood , or Miss Betsey , as my poor mother always called her , when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all ( which was seldom ) , had been married to a husband younger than herself , who was very handsome , except in the sense of the homely adage , ‘ handsome is , that handsome does ’ -- for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey , and even of having once , on a disputed question of supplies , made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs ’ window . These evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off , and effect a separation by mutual consent . He went to India with his capital , and there , according to a wild legend in our family , he was once seen riding on an elephant , in company with a Baboon ; but I think it must have been a Baboo -- or a Begum . Anyhow , from India tidings of his death reached home , within ten years . How they affected my aunt , nobody knew ; for immediately upon the separation , she took her maiden name again , bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off , established herself there as a single woman with one servant , and was understood to live secluded , ever afterwards , in an inflexible retirement . My father had once been a favourite of hers , I believe ; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage , on the ground that my mother was ‘ a wax doll ’ . She had never seen my mother , but she knew her to be not yet twenty . My father and Miss Betsey never met again . He was double my mother ’ s age when he married , and of but a delicate constitution . He died a year afterwards , and , as I have said , six months before I came into the world . This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday . I can make no claim therefore to have known , at that time , how matters stood ; or to have any remembrance , founded on the evidence of my own senses , of what follows . My mother was sitting by the fire , but poorly in health , and very low in spirits , looking at it through her tears , and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger , who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins , in a drawer upstairs , to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival ; my mother , I say , was sitting by the fire , that bright , windy March afternoon , very timid and sad , and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her , when , lifting her eyes as she dried them , to the window opposite , she saw a strange lady coming up the garden . My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance , that it was Miss Betsey . The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady , over the garden-fence , and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else . When she reached the house , she gave another proof of her identity . My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian ; and now , instead of ringing the bell , she came and looked in at that identical window , pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent , that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment . She gave my mother such a turn , that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday . My mother had left her chair in her agitation , and gone behind it in the corner . Miss Betsey , looking round the room , slowly and inquiringly , began on the other side , and carried her eyes on , like a Saracen ’ s Head in a Dutch clock , until they reached my mother . Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother , like one who was accustomed to be obeyed , to come and open the door . My mother went . ‘ Mrs . David Copperfield , I think , ’ said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis referring , perhaps , to my mother ’ s mourning weeds , and her condition . ‘ Yes , ’ said my mother , faintly . ‘ Miss Trotwood , ’ said the visitor . ‘ You have heard of her , I dare say ? ’ My mother answered she had had that pleasure . And she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure . ‘ Now you see her , ’ said Miss Betsey . My mother bent her head , and begged her to walk in . They went into the parlour my mother had come from , the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted -- not having been lighted , indeed , since my father ’ s funeral ; and when they were both seated , and Miss Betsey said nothing , my mother , after vainly trying to restrain herself , began to cry . ‘ Oh tut , tut , tut ! ’ said Miss Betsey , in a hurry . ‘ Don ’ t do that ! Come , come ! ’ My mother couldn ’ t help it notwithstanding , so she cried until she had had her cry out . ‘ Take off your cap , child , ’ said Miss Betsey , ‘ and let me see you. ’ My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so . Therefore she did as she was told , and did it with such nervous hands that her hair ( which was luxuriant and beautiful ) fell all about her face . ‘ Why , bless my heart ! ’ exclaimed Miss Betsey . ‘ You are a very Baby ! ’ My mother was , no doubt , unusually youthful in appearance even for her years ; she hung her head , as if it were her fault , poor thing , and said , sobbing , that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow , and would be but a childish mother if she lived . In a short pause which ensued , she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair , and that with no ungentle hand ; but , looking at her , in her timid hope , she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up , her hands folded on one knee , and her feet upon the fender , frowning at the fire . ‘ In the name of Heaven , ’ said Miss Betsey , suddenly , ‘ why Rookery ? ’ ‘ Do you mean the house , ma ’ am ? ’ asked my mother . ‘ Why Rookery ? ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ Cookery would have been more to the purpose , if you had had any practical ideas of life , either of you. ’ ‘ The name was Mr. Copperfield ’ s choice , ’ returned my mother . ‘ When he bought the house , he liked to think that there were rooks about it. ’ The evening wind made such a disturbance just now , among some tall old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden , that neither my mother nor Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way . As the elms bent to one another , like giants who were whispering secrets , and after a few seconds of such repose , fell into a violent flurry , tossing their wild arms about , as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind , some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks ’ -nests , burdening their higher branches , swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea . ‘ Where are the birds ? ’ asked Miss Betsey . ‘ The -- ? ’ My mother had been thinking of something else . ‘ The rooks -- what has become of them ? ’ asked Miss Betsey . ‘ There have not been any since we have lived here , ’ said my mother . ‘ We thought -- Mr. Copperfield thought -- it was quite a large rookery ; but the nests were very old ones , and the birds have deserted them a long while. ’ ‘ David Copperfield all over ! ’ cried Miss Betsey . ‘ David Copperfield from head to foot ! Calls a house a rookery when there ’ s not a rook near it , and takes the birds on trust , because he sees the nests ! ’ ‘ Mr . Copperfield , ’ returned my mother , ‘ is dead , and if you dare to speak unkindly of him to me -- ’ My poor dear mother , I suppose , had some momentary intention of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt , who could easily have settled her with one hand , even if my mother had been in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening . But it passed with the action of rising from her chair ; and she sat down again very meekly , and fainted . When she came to herself , or when Miss Betsey had restored her , whichever it was , she found the latter standing at the window . The twilight was by this time shading down into darkness ; and dimly as they saw each other , they could not have done that without the aid of the fire . ‘ Well ? ’ said Miss Betsey , coming back to her chair , as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect ; ‘ and when do you expect -- ’ ‘ I am all in a tremble , ’ faltered my mother . ‘ I don ’ t know what ’ s the matter . I shall die , I am sure ! ’ ‘ No , no , no , ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ Have some tea. ’ ‘ Oh dear me , dear me , do you think it will do me any good ? ’ cried my mother in a helpless manner . ‘ Of course it will , ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ It ’ s nothing but fancy . What do you call your girl ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know that it will be a girl , yet , ma ’ am , ’ said my mother innocently . ‘ Bless the Baby ! ’ exclaimed Miss Betsey , unconsciously quoting the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs , but applying it to my mother instead of me , ‘ I don ’ t mean that . I mean your servant-girl. ’ ‘ Peggotty , ’ said my mother . ‘ Peggotty ! ’ repeated Miss Betsey , with some indignation . ‘ Do you mean to say , child , that any human being has gone into a Christian church , and got herself named Peggotty ? ’ ‘ It ’ s her surname , ’ said my mother , faintly . ‘ Mr . Copperfield called her by it , because her Christian name was the same as mine. ’ ‘ Here ! Peggotty ! ’ cried Miss Betsey , opening the parlour door . ‘ Tea . Your mistress is a little unwell . Don ’ t dawdle. ’ Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house , and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice , Miss Betsey shut the door again , and sat down as before : with her feet on the fender , the skirt of her dress tucked up , and her hands folded on one knee . ‘ You were speaking about its being a girl , ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ I have no doubt it will be a girl . I have a presentiment that it must be a girl . Now child , from the moment of the birth of this girl -- ’ ‘ Perhaps boy , ’ my mother took the liberty of putting in . ‘ I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ’ returned Miss Betsey . ‘ Don ’ t contradict . From the moment of this girl ’ s birth , child , I intend to be her friend . I intend to be her godmother , and I beg you ’ ll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield . There must be no mistakes in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood . There must be no trifling with HER affections , poor dear . She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved . I must make that MY care. ’ There was a twitch of Miss Betsey ’ s head , after each of these sentences , as if her own old wrongs were working within her , and she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint . So my mother suspected , at least , as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire : too much scared by Miss Betsey , too uneasy in herself , and too subdued and bewildered altogether , to observe anything very clearly , or to know what to say . ‘ And was David good to you , child ? ’ asked Miss Betsey , when she had been silent for a little while , and these motions of her head had gradually ceased . ‘ Were you comfortable together ? ’ ‘ We were very happy , ’ said my mother . ‘ Mr . Copperfield was only too good to me. ’ ‘ What , he spoilt you , I suppose ? ’ returned Miss Betsey . ‘ For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again , yes , I fear he did indeed , ’ sobbed my mother . ‘ Well ! Don ’ t cry ! ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ You were not equally matched , child -- if any two people can be equally matched -- and so I asked the question . You were an orphan , weren ’ t you ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ And a governess ? ’ ‘ I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit . Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me , and took a great deal of notice of me , and paid me a good deal of attention , and at last proposed to me . And I accepted him . And so we were married , ’ said my mother simply . ‘ Ha ! Poor Baby ! ’ mused Miss Betsey , with her frown still bent upon the fire . ‘ Do you know anything ? ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , ma ’ am , ’ faltered my mother . ‘ About keeping house , for instance , ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ Not much , I fear , ’ returned my mother . ‘ Not so much as I could wish . But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me -- ’ [ ‘ Much he knew about it himself ! ’ ) said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis . -- ‘ And I hope I should have improved , being very anxious to learn , and he very patient to teach me , if the great misfortune of his death ’ -- my mother broke down again here , and could get no farther . ‘ Well , well ! ’ said Miss Betsey . -- ‘ I kept my housekeeping-book regularly , and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night , ’ cried my mother in another burst of distress , and breaking down again . ‘ Well , well ! ’ said Miss Betsey . ‘ Don ’ t cry any more. ’ -- ‘ And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it , except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other , or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines , ’ resumed my mother in another burst , and breaking down again . ‘ You ’ ll make yourself ill , ’ said Miss Betsey , ‘ and you know that will not be good either for you or for my god-daughter . Come ! You mustn ’ t do it ! ’ This argument had some share in quieting my mother , though her increasing indisposition had a larger one . There was an interval of silence , only broken by Miss Betsey ’ s occasionally ejaculating ‘ Ha ! ’ as she sat with her feet upon the fender . ‘ David had bought an annuity for himself with his money , I know , ’ said she , by and by . ‘ What did he do for you ? ’ ‘ Mr . Copperfield , ’ said my mother , answering with some difficulty , ‘ was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me. ’ ‘ How much ? ’ asked Miss Betsey . ‘ A hundred and five pounds a year , ’ said my mother . ‘ He might have done worse , ’ said my aunt . The word was appropriate to the moment . My mother was so much worse that Peggotty , coming in with the teaboard and candles , and seeing at a glance how ill she was , -- as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enough , -- conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed ; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty , her nephew , who had been for some days past secreted in the house , unknown to my mother , as a special messenger in case of emergency , to fetch the nurse and doctor . Those allied powers were considerably astonished , when they arrived within a few minutes of each other , to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance , sitting before the fire , with her bonnet tied over her left arm , stopping her ears with jewellers ’ cotton . Peggotty knowing nothing about her , and my mother saying nothing about her , she was quite a mystery in the parlour ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers ’ cotton in her pocket , and sticking the article in her ears in that way , did not detract from the solemnity of her presence . The doctor having been upstairs and come down again , and having satisfied himself , I suppose , that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himself having to sit there , face to face , for some hours , laid himself out to be polite and social . He was the meekest of his sex , the mildest of little men . He sidled in and out of a room , to take up the less space . He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet , and more slowly . He carried his head on one side , partly in modest depreciation of himself , partly in modest propitiation of everybody else . It is nothing to say that he hadn ’ t a word to throw at a dog . He couldn ’ t have thrown a word at a mad dog . He might have offered him one gently , or half a one , or a fragment of one ; for he spoke as slowly as he walked ; but he wouldn ’ t have been rude to him , and he couldn ’ t have been quick with him , for any earthly consideration . Mr. Chillip , looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side , and making her a little bow , said , in allusion to the jewellers ’ cotton , as he softly touched his left ear : ‘ Some local irritation , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ What ! ’ replied my aunt , pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork . Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness -- as he told my mother afterwards -- that it was a mercy he didn ’ t lose his presence of mind . But he repeated sweetly : ‘ Some local irritation , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ Nonsense ! ’ replied my aunt , and corked herself again , at one blow . Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this , but sit and look at her feebly , as she sat and looked at the fire , until he was called upstairs again . After some quarter of an hour ’ s absence , he returned . ‘ Well ? ’ said my aunt , taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him . ‘ Well , ma ’ am , ’ returned Mr. Chillip , ‘ we are -- we are progressing slowly , ma ’ am. ’ ‘ Ba -- a -- ah ! ’ said my aunt , with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection . And corked herself as before . Really -- really -- as Mr. Chillip told my mother , he was almost shocked ; speaking in a professional point of view alone , he was almost shocked . But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out . After another absence , he again returned . ‘ Well ? ’ said my aunt , taking out the cotton on that side again . ‘ Well , ma ’ am , ’ returned Mr. Chillip , ‘ we are -- we are progressing slowly , ma ’ am. ’ ‘ Ya -- a -- ah ! ’ said my aunt . With such a snarl at him , that Mr. Chillip absolutely could not bear it . It was really calculated to break his spirit , he said afterwards . He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs , in the dark and a strong draught , until he was again sent for . Ham Peggotty , who went to the national school , and was a very dragon at his catechism , and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness , reported next day , that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour after this , he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey , then walking to and fro in a state of agitation , and pounced upon before he could make his escape . That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude , from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest . That , marching him constantly up and down by the collar ( as if he had been taking too much laudanum ) , she , at those times , shook him , rumpled his hair , made light of his linen , stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own , and otherwise tousled and maltreated him . This was in part confirmed by his aunt , who saw him at half past twelve o ’ clock , soon after his release , and affirmed that he was then as red as I was . The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time . He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty , and said to my aunt in his meekest manner : ‘ Well , ma ’ am , I am happy to congratulate you. ’ ‘ What upon ? ’ said my aunt , sharply . Mr. Chillip was fluttered again , by the extreme severity of my aunt ’ s manner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile , to mollify her . ‘ Mercy on the man , what ’ s he doing ! ’ cried my aunt , impatiently . ‘ Can ’ t he speak ? ’ ‘ Be calm , my dear ma ’ am , ’ said Mr. Chillip , in his softest accents . ‘ There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , ma ’ am . Be calm. ’ It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn ’ t shake him , and shake what he had to say , out of him . She only shook her own head at him , but in a way that made him quail . ‘ Well , ma ’ am , ’ resumed Mr. Chillip , as soon as he had courage , ‘ I am happy to congratulate you . All is now over , ma ’ am , and well over. ’ During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration , my aunt eyed him narrowly . ‘ How is she ? ’ said my aunt , folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them . ‘ Well , ma ’ am , she will soon be quite comfortable , I hope , ’ returned Mr. Chillip . ‘ Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be , under these melancholy domestic circumstances . There can not be any objection to your seeing her presently , ma ’ am . It may do her good. ’ ‘ And SHE . How is SHE ? ’ said my aunt , sharply . Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side , and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird . ‘ The baby , ’ said my aunt . ‘ How is she ? ’ ‘ Ma ’ am , ’ returned Mr. Chillip , ‘ I apprehended you had known . It ’ s a boy. ’ My aunt said never a word , but took her bonnet by the strings , in the manner of a sling , aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip ’ s head with it , put it on bent , walked out , and never came back . She vanished like a discontented fairy ; or like one of those supernatural beings , whom it was popularly supposed I was entitled to see ; and never came back any more . No . I lay in my basket , and my mother lay in her bed ; but Betsey Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows , the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled ; and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers , and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he , without whom I had never been . CHAPTER 2 . I OBSERVE The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me , as I look far back , into the blank of my infancy , are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape , and Peggotty with no shape at all , and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face , and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn ’ t peck her in preference to apples . I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart , dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor , and I going unsteadily from the one to the other . I have an impression on my mind which I can not distinguish from actual remembrance , of the touch of Peggotty ’ s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me , and of its being roughened by needlework , like a pocket nutmeg-grater . This may be fancy , though I think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose ; just as I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy . Indeed , I think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect , may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty , than to have acquired it ; the rather , as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness , and gentleness , and capacity of being pleased , which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood . I might have a misgiving that I am ‘ meandering ’ in stopping to say this , but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions , in part upon my own experience of myself ; and if it should appear from anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observation , or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood , I undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics . Looking back , as I was saying , into the blank of my infancy , the first objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things , are my mother and Peggotty . What else do I remember ? Let me see . There comes out of the cloud , our house -- not new to me , but quite familiar , in its earliest remembrance . On the ground-floor is Peggotty ’ s kitchen , opening into a back yard ; with a pigeon-house on a pole , in the centre , without any pigeons in it ; a great dog-kennel in a corner , without any dog ; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me , walking about , in a menacing and ferocious manner . There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow , and seems to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen window , who makes me shiver , he is so fierce . Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when I go that way , I dream at night : as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions . Here is a long passage -- what an enormous perspective I make of it ! -- leading from Peggotty ’ s kitchen to the front door . A dark store-room opens out of it , and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I don ’ t know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea-chests , when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light , letting a mouldy air come out of the door , in which there is the smell of soap , pickles , pepper , candles , and coffee , all at one whiff . Then there are the two parlours : the parlour in which we sit of an evening , my mother and I and Peggotty -- for Peggotty is quite our companion , when her work is done and we are alone -- and the best parlour where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly , but not so comfortably . There is something of a doleful air about that room to me , for Peggotty has told me -- I don ’ t know when , but apparently ages ago -- about my father ’ s funeral , and the company having their black cloaks put on . One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there , how Lazarus was raised up from the dead . And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed , and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window , with the dead all lying in their graves at rest , below the solemn moon . There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere , as the grass of that churchyard ; nothing half so shady as its trees ; nothing half so quiet as its tombstones . The sheep are feeding there , when I kneel up , early in the morning , in my little bed in a closet within my mother ’ s room , to look out at it ; and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial , and think within myself , ‘ Is the sun-dial glad , I wonder , that it can tell the time again ? ’ Here is our pew in the church . What a high-backed pew ! With a window near it , out of which our house can be seen , and IS seen many times during the morning ’ s service , by Peggotty , who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it ’ s not being robbed , or is not in flames . But though Peggotty ’ s eye wanders , she is much offended if mine does , and frowns to me , as I stand upon the seat , that I am to look at the clergyman . But I can ’ t always look at him -- I know him without that white thing on , and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so , and perhaps stopping the service to inquire -- and what am I to do ? It ’ s a dreadful thing to gape , but I must do something . I look at my mother , but she pretends not to see me . I look at a boy in the aisle , and he makes faces at me . I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch , and there I see a stray sheep -- I don ’ t mean a sinner , but mutton -- half making up his mind to come into the church . I feel that if I looked at him any longer , I might be tempted to say something out loud ; and what would become of me then ! I look up at the monumental tablets on the wall , and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this parish , and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been , when affliction sore , long time Mr. Bodgers bore , and physicians were in vain . I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip , and he was in vain ; and if so , how he likes to be reminded of it once a week . I look from Mr. Chillip , in his Sunday neckcloth , to the pulpit ; and think what a good place it would be to play in , and what a castle it would make , with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it , and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head . In time my eyes gradually shut up ; and , from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat , I hear nothing , until I fall off the seat with a crash , and am taken out , more dead than alive , by Peggotty . And now I see the outside of our house , with the latticed bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air , and the ragged old rooks ’ -nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front garden . Now I am in the garden at the back , beyond the yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are -- a very preserve of butterflies , as I remember it , with a high fence , and a gate and padlock ; where the fruit clusters on the trees , riper and richer than fruit has ever been since , in any other garden , and where my mother gathers some in a basket , while I stand by , bolting furtive gooseberries , and trying to look unmoved . A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment . We are playing in the winter twilight , dancing about the parlour . When my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow-chair , I watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers , and straitening her waist , and nobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well , and is proud of being so pretty . That is among my very earliest impressions . That , and a sense that we were both a little afraid of Peggotty , and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction , were among the first opinions -- if they may be so called -- that I ever derived from what I saw . Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire , alone . I had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles . I must have read very perspicuously , or the poor soul must have been deeply interested , for I remember she had a cloudy impression , after I had done , that they were a sort of vegetable . I was tired of reading , and dead sleepy ; but having leave , as a high treat , to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour ’ s , I would rather have died upon my post ( of course ) than have gone to bed . I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large . I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers , and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work ; at the little bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread -- how old it looked , being so wrinkled in all directions ! -- at the little house with a thatched roof , where the yard-measure lived ; at her work-box with a sliding lid , with a view of St. Paul ’ s Cathedral ( with a pink dome ) painted on the top ; at the brass thimble on her finger ; at herself , whom I thought lovely . I felt so sleepy , that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment , I was gone . ‘ Peggotty , ’ says I , suddenly , ‘ were you ever married ? ’ ‘ Lord , Master Davy , ’ replied Peggotty . ‘ What ’ s put marriage in your head ? ’ She answered with such a start , that it quite awoke me . And then she stopped in her work , and looked at me , with her needle drawn out to its thread ’ s length . ‘ But WERE you ever married , Peggotty ? ’ says I . ‘ You are a very handsome woman , an ’ t you ? ’ I thought her in a different style from my mother , certainly ; but of another school of beauty , I considered her a perfect example . There was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour , on which my mother had painted a nosegay . The ground-work of that stool , and Peggotty ’ s complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing . The stool was smooth , and Peggotty was rough , but that made no difference . ‘ Me handsome , Davy ! ’ said Peggotty . ‘ Lawk , no , my dear ! But what put marriage in your head ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know ! -- You mustn ’ t marry more than one person at a time , may you , Peggotty ? ’ ‘ Certainly not , ’ says Peggotty , with the promptest decision . ‘ But if you marry a person , and the person dies , why then you may marry another person , mayn ’ t you , Peggotty ? ’ ‘ YOU MAY , ’ says Peggotty , ‘ if you choose , my dear . That ’ s a matter of opinion. ’ ‘ But what is your opinion , Peggotty ? ’ said I. I asked her , and looked curiously at her , because she looked so curiously at me . ‘ My opinion is , ’ said Peggotty , taking her eyes from me , after a little indecision and going on with her work , ‘ that I never was married myself , Master Davy , and that I don ’ t expect to be . That ’ s all I know about the subject. ’ ‘ You an ’ t cross , I suppose , Peggotty , are you ? ’ said I , after sitting quiet for a minute . I really thought she was , she had been so short with me ; but I was quite mistaken : for she laid aside her work ( which was a stocking of her own ) , and opening her arms wide , took my curly head within them , and gave it a good squeeze . I know it was a good squeeze , because , being very plump , whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed , some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off . And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour , while she was hugging me . ‘ Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills , ’ said Peggotty , who was not quite right in the name yet , ‘ for I an ’ t heard half enough. ’ I couldn ’ t quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer , or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles . However , we returned to those monsters , with fresh wakefulness on my part , and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch ; and we ran away from them , and baffled them by constantly turning , which they were unable to do quickly , on account of their unwieldy make ; and we went into the water after them , as natives , and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats ; and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet . I did , at least ; but I had my doubts of Peggotty , who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms , all the time . We had exhausted the crocodiles , and begun with the alligators , when the garden-bell rang . We went out to the door ; and there was my mother , looking unusually pretty , I thought , and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers , who had walked home with us from church last Sunday . As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me , the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch -- or something like that ; for my later understanding comes , I am sensible , to my aid here . ‘ What does that mean ? ’ I asked him , over her shoulder . He patted me on the head ; but somehow , I didn ’ t like him or his deep voice , and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother ’ s in touching me -- which it did . I put it away , as well as I could . ‘ Oh , Davy ! ’ remonstrated my mother . ‘ Dear boy ! ’ said the gentleman . ‘ I can not wonder at his devotion ! ’ I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother ’ s face before . She gently chid me for being rude ; and , keeping me close to her shawl , turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home . She put out her hand to him as she spoke , and , as he met it with his own , she glanced , I thought , at me . ‘ Let us say “ good night ” , my fine boy , ’ said the gentleman , when he had bent his head -- I saw him ! -- over my mother ’ s little glove . ‘ Good night ! ’ said I . ‘ Come ! Let us be the best friends in the world ! ’ said the gentleman , laughing . ‘ Shake hands ! ’ My right hand was in my mother ’ s left , so I gave him the other . ‘ Why , that ’ s the Wrong hand , Davy ! ’ laughed the gentleman . My mother drew my right hand forward , but I was resolved , for my former reason , not to give it him , and I did not . I gave him the other , and he shook it heartily , and said I was a brave fellow , and went away . At this minute I see him turn round in the garden , and give us a last look with his ill-omened black eyes , before the door was shut . Peggotty , who had not said a word or moved a finger , secured the fastenings instantly , and we all went into the parlour . My mother , contrary to her usual habit , instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the fire , remained at the other end of the room , and sat singing to herself . -- ‘ Hope you have had a pleasant evening , ma ’ am , ’ said Peggotty , standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room , with a candlestick in her hand . ‘ Much obliged to you , Peggotty , ’ returned my mother , in a cheerful voice , ‘ I have had a VERY pleasant evening. ’ ‘ A stranger or so makes an agreeable change , ’ suggested Peggotty . ‘ A very agreeable change , indeed , ’ returned my mother . Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room , and my mother resuming her singing , I fell asleep , though I was not so sound asleep but that I could hear voices , without hearing what they said . When I half awoke from this uncomfortable doze , I found Peggotty and my mother both in tears , and both talking . ‘ Not such a one as this , Mr. Copperfield wouldn ’ t have liked , ’ said Peggotty . ‘ That I say , and that I swear ! ’ ‘ Good Heavens ! ’ cried my mother , ‘ you ’ ll drive me mad ! Was ever any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am ! Why do I do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl ? Have I never been married , Peggotty ? ’ ‘ God knows you have , ma ’ am , ’ returned Peggotty . ‘ Then , how can you dare , ’ said my mother -- ‘ you know I don ’ t mean how can you dare , Peggotty , but how can you have the heart -- to make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me , when you are well aware that I haven ’ t , out of this place , a single friend to turn to ? ’ ‘ The more ’ s the reason , ’ returned Peggotty , ‘ for saying that it won ’ t do . No ! That it won ’ t do . No ! No price could make it do . No ! ’ -- I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away , she was so emphatic with it . ‘ How can you be so aggravating , ’ said my mother , shedding more tears than before , ‘ as to talk in such an unjust manner ! How can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged , Peggotty , when I tell you over and over again , you cruel thing , that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed ! You talk of admiration . What am I to do ? If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment , is it my fault ? What am I to do , I ask you ? Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face , or disfigure myself with a burn , or a scald , or something of that sort ? I dare say you would , Peggotty . I dare say you ’ d quite enjoy it. ’ Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart , I thought . ‘ And my dear boy , ’ cried my mother , coming to the elbow-chair in which I was , and caressing me , ‘ my own little Davy ! Is it to be hinted to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure , the dearest little fellow that ever was ! ’ ‘ Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing , ’ said Peggotty . ‘ You did , Peggotty ! ’ returned my mother . ‘ You know you did . What else was it possible to infer from what you said , you unkind creature , when you know as well as I do , that on his account only last quarter I wouldn ’ t buy myself a new parasol , though that old green one is frayed the whole way up , and the fringe is perfectly mangy ? You know it is , Peggotty . You can ’ t deny it. ’ Then , turning affectionately to me , with her cheek against mine , ‘ Am I a naughty mama to you , Davy ? Am I a nasty , cruel , selfish , bad mama ? Say I am , my child ; say “ yes ” , dear boy , and Peggotty will love you ; and Peggotty ’ s love is a great deal better than mine , Davy . I don ’ t love you at all , do I ? ’ At this , we all fell a-crying together . I think I was the loudest of the party , but I am sure we were all sincere about it . I was quite heart-broken myself , and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded tenderness I called Peggotty a ‘ Beast ’ . That honest creature was in deep affliction , I remember , and must have become quite buttonless on the occasion ; for a little volley of those explosives went off , when , after having made it up with my mother , she kneeled down by the elbow-chair , and made it up with me . We went to bed greatly dejected . My sobs kept waking me , for a long time ; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed , I found my mother sitting on the coverlet , and leaning over me . I fell asleep in her arms , after that , and slept soundly . Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again , or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared , I can not recall . I don ’ t profess to be clear about dates . But there he was , in church , and he walked home with us afterwards . He came in , too , to look at a famous geranium we had , in the parlour-window . It did not appear to me that he took much notice of it , but before he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom . She begged him to choose it for himself , but he refused to do that -- I could not understand why -- so she plucked it for him , and gave it into his hand . He said he would never , never part with it any more ; and I thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two . Peggotty began to be less with us , of an evening , than she had always been . My mother deferred to her very much -- more than usual , it occurred to me -- and we were all three excellent friends ; still we were different from what we used to be , and were not so comfortable among ourselves . Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother ’ s wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers , or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour ’ s ; but I couldn ’ t , to my satisfaction , make out how it was . Gradually , I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers . I liked him no better than at first , and had the same uneasy jealousy of him ; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child ’ s instinctive dislike , and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make much of my mother without any help , it certainly was not THE reason that I might have found if I had been older . No such thing came into my mind , or near it . I could observe , in little pieces , as it were ; but as to making a net of a number of these pieces , and catching anybody in it , that was , as yet , beyond me . One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden , when Mr. Murdstone -- I knew him by that name now -- came by , on horseback . He reined up his horse to salute my mother , and said he was going to Lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht , and merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if I would like the ride . The air was so clear and pleasant , and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride so much himself , as he stood snorting and pawing at the garden-gate , that I had a great desire to go . So I was sent upstairs to Peggotty to be made spruce ; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone dismounted , and , with his horse ’ s bridle drawn over his arm , walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence , while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company . I recollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window ; I recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them , as they strolled along ; and how , from being in a perfectly angelic temper , Peggotty turned cross in a moment , and brushed my hair the wrong way , excessively hard . Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off , and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road . He held me quite easily with one arm , and I don ’ t think I was restless usually ; but I could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes , and looking up in his face . He had that kind of shallow black eye -- I want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into -- which , when it is abstracted , seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured , for a moment at a time , by a cast . Several times when I glanced at him , I observed that appearance with a sort of awe , and wondered what he was thinking about so closely . His hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker , looked at so near , than even I had given them credit for being . A squareness about the lower part of his face , and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day , reminded me of the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year before . This , his regular eyebrows , and the rich white , and black , and brown , of his complexion -- confound his complexion , and his memory ! -- made me think him , in spite of my misgivings , a very handsome man . I have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too . We went to an hotel by the sea , where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves . Each of them was lying on at least four chairs , and had a large rough jacket on . In a corner was a heap of coats and boat-cloaks , and a flag , all bundled up together . They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner , when we came in , and said , ‘ Halloa , Murdstone ! We thought you were dead ! ’ ‘ Not yet , ’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘ And who ’ s this shaver ? ’ said one of the gentlemen , taking hold of me . ‘ That ’ s Davy , ’ returned Mr. Murdstone . ‘ Davy who ? ’ said the gentleman . ‘ Jones ? ’ ‘ Copperfield , ’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘ What ! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield ’ s encumbrance ? ’ cried the gentleman . ‘ The pretty little widow ? ’ ‘ Quinion , ’ said Mr. Murdstone , ‘ take care , if you please . Somebody ’ s sharp. ’ ‘ Who is ? ’ asked the gentleman , laughing . I looked up , quickly ; being curious to know . ‘ Only Brooks of Sheffield , ’ said Mr. Murdstone . I was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield ; for , at first , I really thought it was I . There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr. Brooks of Sheffield , for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned , and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also . After some laughing , the gentleman whom he had called Quinion , said : ‘ And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield , in reference to the projected business ? ’ ‘ Why , I don ’ t know that Brooks understands much about it at present , ’ replied Mr. Murdstone ; ‘ but he is not generally favourable , I believe. ’ There was more laughter at this , and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks . This he did ; and when the wine came , he made me have a little , with a biscuit , and , before I drank it , stand up and say , ‘ Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield ! ’ The toast was received with great applause , and such hearty laughter that it made me laugh too ; at which they laughed the more . In short , we quite enjoyed ourselves . We walked about on the cliff after that , and sat on the grass , and looked at things through a telescope -- I could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye , but I pretended I could -- and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner . All the time we were out , the two gentlemen smoked incessantly -- which , I thought , if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats , they must have been doing , ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor ’ s . I must not forget that we went on board the yacht , where they all three descended into the cabin , and were busy with some papers . I saw them quite hard at work , when I looked down through the open skylight . They left me , during this time , with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it , who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on , with ‘ Skylark ’ in capital letters across the chest . I thought it was his name ; and that as he lived on board ship and hadn ’ t a street door to put his name on , he put it there instead ; but when I called him Mr. Skylark , he said it meant the vessel . I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the two gentlemen . They were very gay and careless . They joked freely with one another , but seldom with him . It appeared to me that he was more clever and cold than they were , and that they regarded him with something of my own feeling . I remarked that , once or twice when Mr. Quinion was talking , he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways , as if to make sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when Mr. Passnidge ( the other gentleman ) was in high spirits , he trod upon his foot , and gave him a secret caution with his eyes , to observe Mr. Murdstone , who was sitting stern and silent . Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed at all that day , except at the Sheffield joke -- and that , by the by , was his own . We went home early in the evening . It was a very fine evening , and my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar , while I was sent in to get my tea . When he was gone , my mother asked me all about the day I had had , and what they had said and done . I mentioned what they had said about her , and she laughed , and told me they were impudent fellows who talked nonsense -- but I knew it pleased her . I knew it quite as well as I know it now . I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield , but she answered No , only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way . Can I say of her face -- altered as I have reason to remember it , perished as I know it is -- that it is gone , when here it comes before me at this instant , as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a crowded street ? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty , that it faded , and was no more , when its breath falls on my cheek now , as it fell that night ? Can I say she ever changed , when my remembrance brings her back to life , thus only ; and , truer to its loving youth than I have been , or man ever is , still holds fast what it cherished then ? I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk , and she came to bid me good night . She kneeled down playfully by the side of the bed , and laying her chin upon her hands , and laughing , said : ‘ What was it they said , Davy ? Tell me again . I can ’ t believe it. ’ ‘ “ Bewitching -- “ ’ I began . My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me . ‘ It was never bewitching , ’ she said , laughing . ‘ It never could have been bewitching , Davy . Now I know it wasn ’ t ! ’ ‘ Yes , it was . “ Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield ” , ’ I repeated stoutly . ‘ And , “ pretty. ” ’ ‘ No , no , it was never pretty . Not pretty , ’ interposed my mother , laying her fingers on my lips again . ‘ Yes it was . “ Pretty little widow. ” ’ ‘ What foolish , impudent creatures ! ’ cried my mother , laughing and covering her face . ‘ What ridiculous men ! An ’ t they ? Davy dear -- ’ ‘ Well , Ma. ’ ‘ Don ’ t tell Peggotty ; she might be angry with them . I am dreadfully angry with them myself ; but I would rather Peggotty didn ’ t know. ’ I promised , of course ; and we kissed one another over and over again , and I soon fell fast asleep . It seems to me , at this distance of time , as if it were the next day when Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am about to mention ; but it was probably about two months afterwards . We were sitting as before , one evening ( when my mother was out as before ) , in company with the stocking and the yard-measure , and the bit of wax , and the box with St. Paul ’ s on the lid , and the crocodile book , when Peggotty , after looking at me several times , and opening her mouth as if she were going to speak , without doing it -- which I thought was merely gaping , or I should have been rather alarmed -- said coaxingly : ‘ Master Davy , how should you like to go along with me and spend a fortnight at my brother ’ s at Yarmouth ? Wouldn ’ t that be a treat ? ’ ‘ Is your brother an agreeable man , Peggotty ? ’ I inquired , provisionally . ‘ Oh , what an agreeable man he is ! ’ cried Peggotty , holding up her hands . ‘ Then there ’ s the sea ; and the boats and ships ; and the fishermen ; and the beach ; and Am to play with -- ’ Peggotty meant her nephew Ham , mentioned in my first chapter ; but she spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar . I was flushed by her summary of delights , and replied that it would indeed be a treat , but what would my mother say ? ‘ Why then I ’ ll as good as bet a guinea , ’ said Peggotty , intent upon my face , ‘ that she ’ ll let us go . I ’ ll ask her , if you like , as soon as ever she comes home . There now ! ’ ‘ But what ’ s she to do while we ’ re away ? ’ said I , putting my small elbows on the table to argue the point . ‘ She can ’ t live by herself. ’ If Peggotty were looking for a hole , all of a sudden , in the heel of that stocking , it must have been a very little one indeed , and not worth darning . ‘ I say ! Peggotty ! She can ’ t live by herself , you know. ’ ‘ Oh , bless you ! ’ said Peggotty , looking at me again at last . ‘ Don ’ t you know ? She ’ s going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper . Mrs. Grayper ’ s going to have a lot of company. ’ Oh ! If that was it , I was quite ready to go . I waited , in the utmost impatience , until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper ’ s ( for it was that identical neighbour ) , to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea . Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected , my mother entered into it readily ; and it was all arranged that night , and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for . The day soon came for our going . It was such an early day that it came soon , even to me , who was in a fever of expectation , and half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain , or some other great convulsion of nature , might interpose to stop the expedition . We were to go in a carrier ’ s cart , which departed in the morning after breakfast . I would have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night , and sleep in my hat and boots . It touches me nearly now , although I tell it lightly , to recollect how eager I was to leave my happy home ; to think how little I suspected what I did leave for ever . I am glad to recollect that when the carrier ’ s cart was at the gate , and my mother stood there kissing me , a grateful fondness for her and for the old place I had never turned my back upon before , made me cry . I am glad to know that my mother cried too , and that I felt her heart beat against mine . I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move , my mother ran out at the gate , and called to him to stop , that she might kiss me once more . I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine , and did so . As we left her standing in the road , Mr. Murdstone came up to where she was , and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved . I was looking back round the awning of the cart , and wondered what business it was of his . Peggotty , who was also looking back on the other side , seemed anything but satisfied ; as the face she brought back in the cart denoted . I sat looking at Peggotty for some time , in a reverie on this supposititious case : whether , if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale , I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed . CHAPTER 3 . I HAVE A CHANGE The carrier ’ s horse was the laziest horse in the world , I should hope , and shuffled along , with his head down , as if he liked to keep people waiting to whom the packages were directed . I fancied , indeed , that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection , but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough . The carrier had a way of keeping his head down , like his horse , and of drooping sleepily forward as he drove , with one of his arms on each of his knees . I say ‘ drove ’ , but it struck me that the cart would have gone to Yarmouth quite as well without him , for the horse did all that ; and as to conversation , he had no idea of it but whistling . Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee , which would have lasted us out handsomely , if we had been going to London by the same conveyance . We ate a good deal , and slept a good deal . Peggotty always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket , her hold of which never relaxed ; and I could not have believed unless I had heard her do it , that one defenceless woman could have snored so much . We made so many deviations up and down lanes , and were such a long time delivering a bedstead at a public-house , and calling at other places , that I was quite tired , and very glad , when we saw Yarmouth . It looked rather spongy and soppy , I thought , as I carried my eye over the great dull waste that lay across the river ; and I could not help wondering , if the world were really as round as my geography book said , how any part of it came to be so flat . But I reflected that Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles ; which would account for it . As we drew a little nearer , and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a straight low line under the sky , I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so might have improved it ; and also that if the land had been a little more separated from the sea , and the town and the tide had not been quite so much mixed up , like toast and water , it would have been nicer . But Peggotty said , with greater emphasis than usual , that we must take things as we found them , and that , for her part , she was proud to call herself a Yarmouth Bloater . When we got into the street ( which was strange enough to me ) and smelt the fish , and pitch , and oakum , and tar , and saw the sailors walking about , and the carts jingling up and down over the stones , I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to Peggotty , who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency , and told me it was well known ( I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born Bloaters ) that Yarmouth was , upon the whole , the finest place in the universe . ‘ Here ’ s my Am ! ’ screamed Peggotty , ‘ growed out of knowledge ! ’ He was waiting for us , in fact , at the public-house ; and asked me how I found myself , like an old acquaintance . I did not feel , at first , that I knew him as well as he knew me , because he had never come to our house since the night I was born , and naturally he had the advantage of me . But our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry me home . He was , now , a huge , strong fellow of six feet high , broad in proportion , and round-shouldered ; but with a simpering boy ’ s face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look . He was dressed in a canvas jacket , and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone , without any legs in them . And you couldn ’ t so properly have said he wore a hat , as that he was covered in a-top , like an old building , with something pitchy . Ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm , and Peggotty carrying another small box of ours , we turned down lanes bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand , and went past gas-works , rope-walks , boat-builders ’ yards , shipwrights ’ yards , ship-breakers ’ yards , caulkers ’ yards , riggers ’ lofts , smiths ’ forges , and a great litter of such places , until we came out upon the dull waste I had already seen at a distance ; when Ham said , ‘ Yon ’ s our house , Mas ’ r Davy ! ’ I looked in all directions , as far as I could stare over the wilderness , and away at the sea , and away at the river , but no house could I make out . There was a black barge , or some other kind of superannuated boat , not far off , high and dry on the ground , with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily ; but nothing else in the way of a habitation that was visible to me . ‘ That ’ s not it ? ’ said I . ‘ That ship-looking thing ? ’ ‘ That ’ s it , Mas ’ r Davy , ’ returned Ham . If it had been Aladdin ’ s palace , roc ’ s egg and all , I suppose I could not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it . There was a delightful door cut in the side , and it was roofed in , and there were little windows in it ; but the wonderful charm of it was , that it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundreds of times , and which had never been intended to be lived in , on dry land . That was the captivation of it to me . If it had ever been meant to be lived in , I might have thought it small , or inconvenient , or lonely ; but never having been designed for any such use , it became a perfect abode . It was beautifully clean inside , and as tidy as possible . There was a table , and a Dutch clock , and a chest of drawers , and on the chest of drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a parasol , taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a hoop . The tray was kept from tumbling down , by a bible ; and the tray , if it had tumbled down , would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around the book . On the walls there were some common coloured pictures , framed and glazed , of scripture subjects ; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars , without seeing the whole interior of Peggotty ’ s brother ’ s house again , at one view . Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue , and Daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions , were the most prominent of these . Over the little mantelshelf , was a picture of the ‘ Sarah Jane ’ lugger , built at Sunderland , with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it ; a work of art , combining composition with carpentry , which I considered to be one of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford . There were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling , the use of which I did not divine then ; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort , which served for seats and eked out the chairs . All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold -- child-like , according to my theory -- and then Peggotty opened a little door and showed me my bedroom . It was the completest and most desirable bedroom ever seen -- in the stern of the vessel ; with a little window , where the rudder used to go through ; a little looking-glass , just the right height for me , nailed against the wall , and framed with oyster-shells ; a little bed , which there was just room enough to get into ; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table . The walls were whitewashed as white as milk , and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness . One thing I particularly noticed in this delightful house , was the smell of fish ; which was so searching , that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose , I found it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster . On my imparting this discovery in confidence to Peggotty , she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters , crabs , and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures , in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another , and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of , were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept . We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron , whom I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham ’ s back , about a quarter of a mile off . Likewise by a most beautiful little girl ( or I thought her so ) with a necklace of blue beads on , who wouldn ’ t let me kiss her when I offered to , but ran away and hid herself . By and by , when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs , melted butter , and potatoes , with a chop for me , a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home . As he called Peggotty ‘ Lass ’ , and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek , I had no doubt , from the general propriety of her conduct , that he was her brother ; and so he turned out -- being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty , the master of the house . ‘ Glad to see you , sir , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ You ’ ll find us rough , sir , but you ’ ll find us ready. ’ I thanked him , and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a delightful place . ‘ How ’ s your Ma , sir ? ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Did you leave her pretty jolly ? ’ I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could wish , and that she desired her compliments -- which was a polite fiction on my part . ‘ I ’ m much obleeged to her , I ’ m sure , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Well , sir , if you can make out here , fur a fortnut , ‘ long wi ’ her , ’ nodding at his sister , ‘ and Ham , and little Em ’ ly , we shall be proud of your company. ’ Having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner , Mr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water , remarking that ‘ cold would never get his muck off ’ . He soon returned , greatly improved in appearance ; but so rubicund , that I couldn ’ t help thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters , crabs , and crawfish , -- that it went into the hot water very black , and came out very red . After tea , when the door was shut and all was made snug ( the nights being cold and misty now ) , it seemed to me the most delicious retreat that the imagination of man could conceive . To hear the wind getting up out at sea , to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat outside , and to look at the fire , and think that there was no house near but this one , and this one a boat , was like enchantment . Little Em ’ ly had overcome her shyness , and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers , which was just large enough for us two , and just fitted into the chimney corner . Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron , was knitting on the opposite side of the fire . Peggotty at her needlework was as much at home with St. Paul ’ s and the bit of wax-candle , as if they had never known any other roof . Ham , who had been giving me my first lesson in all-fours , was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes with the dirty cards , and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all the cards he turned . Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe . I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence . ‘ Mr . Peggotty ! ’ says I . ‘ Sir , ’ says he . ‘ Did you give your son the name of Ham , because you lived in a sort of ark ? ’ Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea , but answered : ‘ No , sir . I never giv him no name. ’ ‘ Who gave him that name , then ? ’ said I , putting question number two of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Why , sir , his father giv it him , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ I thought you were his father ! ’ ‘ My brother Joe was his father , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Dead , Mr. Peggotty ? ’ I hinted , after a respectful pause . ‘ Drowndead , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham ’ s father , and began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody else there . I was so curious to know , that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Little Em ’ ly , ’ I said , glancing at her . ‘ She is your daughter , isn ’ t she , Mr. Peggotty ? ’ ‘ No , sir . My brother-in-law , Tom , was her father. ’ I couldn ’ t help it . ‘ -- Dead , Mr. Peggotty ? ’ I hinted , after another respectful silence . ‘ Drowndead , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject , but had not got to the bottom of it yet , and must get to the bottom somehow . So I said : ‘ Haven ’ t you ANY children , Mr. Peggotty ? ’ ‘ No , master , ’ he answered with a short laugh . ‘ I ’ m a bacheldore. ’ ‘ A bachelor ! ’ I said , astonished . ‘ Why , who ’ s that , Mr. Peggotty ? ’ pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting . ‘ That ’ s Missis Gummidge , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Gummidge , Mr. Peggotty ? ’ But at this point Peggotty -- I mean my own peculiar Peggotty -- made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions , that I could only sit and look at all the silent company , until it was time to go to bed . Then , in the privacy of my own little cabin , she informed me that Ham and Em ’ ly were an orphan nephew and niece , whom my host had at different times adopted in their childhood , when they were left destitute : and that Mrs. Gummidge was the widow of his partner in a boat , who had died very poor . He was but a poor man himself , said Peggotty , but as good as gold and as true as steel -- those were her similes . The only subject , she informed me , on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an oath , was this generosity of his ; and if it were ever referred to , by any one of them , he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand ( had split it on one such occasion ) , and swore a dreadful oath that he would be ‘ Gormed ’ if he didn ’ t cut and run for good , if it was ever mentioned again . It appeared , in answer to my inquiries , that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be gormed ; but that they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn imprecation . I was very sensible of my entertainer ’ s goodness , and listened to the women ’ s going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end of the boat , and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof , in a very luxurious state of mind , enhanced by my being sleepy . As slumber gradually stole upon me , I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so fiercely , that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the night . But I bethought myself that I was in a boat , after all ; and that a man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen . Nothing happened , however , worse than morning . Almost as soon as it shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed , and out with little Em ’ ly , picking up stones upon the beach . ‘ You ’ re quite a sailor , I suppose ? ’ I said to Em ’ ly . I don ’ t know that I supposed anything of the kind , but I felt it an act of gallantry to say something ; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little image of itself , at the moment , in her bright eye , that it came into my head to say this . ‘ No , ’ replied Em ’ ly , shaking her head , ‘ I ’ m afraid of the sea. ’ ‘ Afraid ! ’ I said , with a becoming air of boldness , and looking very big at the mighty ocean . ‘ I an ’ t ! ’ ‘ Ah ! but it ’ s cruel , ’ said Em ’ ly . ‘ I have seen it very cruel to some of our men . I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house , all to pieces. ’ ‘ I hope it wasn ’ t the boat that -- ’ ‘ That father was drownded in ? ’ said Em ’ ly . ‘ No . Not that one , I never see that boat. ’ ‘ Nor him ? ’ I asked her . Little Em ’ ly shook her head . ‘ Not to remember ! ’ Here was a coincidence ! I immediately went into an explanation how I had never seen my own father ; and how my mother and I had always lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable , and lived so then , and always meant to live so ; and how my father ’ s grave was in the churchyard near our house , and shaded by a tree , beneath the boughs of which I had walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning . But there were some differences between Em ’ ly ’ s orphanhood and mine , it appeared . She had lost her mother before her father ; and where her father ’ s grave was no one knew , except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea . ‘ Besides , ’ said Em ’ ly , as she looked about for shells and pebbles , ‘ your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady ; and my father was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman ’ s daughter , and my uncle Dan is a fisherman. ’ ‘ Dan is Mr. Peggotty , is he ? ’ said I . ‘ Uncle Dan -- yonder , ’ answered Em ’ ly , nodding at the boat-house . ‘ Yes . I mean him . He must be very good , I should think ? ’ ‘ Good ? ’ said Em ’ ly . ‘ If I was ever to be a lady , I ’ d give him a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons , nankeen trousers , a red velvet waistcoat , a cocked hat , a large gold watch , a silver pipe , and a box of money. ’ I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures . I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece , and that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat ; but I kept these sentiments to myself . Little Em ’ ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles , as if they were a glorious vision . We went on again , picking up shells and pebbles . ‘ You would like to be a lady ? ’ I said . Emily looked at me , and laughed and nodded ‘ yes ’ . ‘ I should like it very much . We would all be gentlefolks together , then . Me , and uncle , and Ham , and Mrs. Gummidge . We wouldn ’ t mind then , when there comes stormy weather. -- -Not for our own sakes , I mean . We would for the poor fishermen ’ s , to be sure , and we ’ d help ‘ em with money when they come to any hurt. ’ This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all improbable picture . I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it , and little Em ’ ly was emboldened to say , shyly , ‘ Don ’ t you think you are afraid of the sea , now ? ’ It was quiet enough to reassure me , but I have no doubt if I had seen a moderately large wave come tumbling in , I should have taken to my heels , with an awful recollection of her drowned relations . However , I said ‘ No , ’ and I added , ‘ You don ’ t seem to be either , though you say you are , ’ -- for she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon , and I was afraid of her falling over . ‘ I ’ m not afraid in this way , ’ said little Em ’ ly . ‘ But I wake when it blows , and tremble to think of Uncle Dan and Ham and believe I hear ‘ em crying out for help . That ’ s why I should like so much to be a lady . But I ’ m not afraid in this way . Not a bit . Look here ! ’ She started from my side , and ran along a jagged timber which protruded from the place we stood upon , and overhung the deep water at some height , without the least defence . The incident is so impressed on my remembrance , that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form here , I dare say , accurately as it was that day , and little Em ’ ly springing forward to her destruction ( as it appeared to me ) , with a look that I have never forgotten , directed far out to sea . The light , bold , fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me , and I soon laughed at my fears , and at the cry I had uttered ; fruitlessly in any case , for there was no one near . But there have been times since , in my manhood , many times there have been , when I have thought , Is it possible , among the possibilities of hidden things , that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off , there was any merciful attraction of her into danger , any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father , that her life might have a chance of ending that day ? There has been a time since when I have wondered whether , if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance , and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it , and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand , I ought to have held it up to save her . There has been a time since -- I do not say it lasted long , but it has been -- when I have asked myself the question , would it have been better for little Em ’ ly to have had the waters close above her head that morning in my sight ; and when I have answered Yes , it would have been . This may be premature . I have set it down too soon , perhaps . But let it stand . We strolled a long way , and loaded ourselves with things that we thought curious , and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water -- I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so , or the reverse -- and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty ’ s dwelling . We stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to exchange an innocent kiss , and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure . ‘ Like two young mavishes , ’ Mr. Peggotty said . I knew this meant , in our local dialect , like two young thrushes , and received it as a compliment . Of course I was in love with little Em ’ ly . I am sure I loved that baby quite as truly , quite as tenderly , with greater purity and more disinterestedness , than can enter into the best love of a later time of life , high and ennobling as it is . I am sure my fancy raised up something round that blue-eyed mite of a child , which etherealized , and made a very angel of her . If , any sunny forenoon , she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes , I don ’ t think I should have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect . We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving manner , hours and hours . The days sported by us , as if Time had not grown up himself yet , but were a child too , and always at play . I told Em ’ ly I adored her , and that unless she confessed she adored me I should be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword . She said she did , and I have no doubt she did . As to any sense of inequality , or youthfulness , or other difficulty in our way , little Em ’ ly and I had no such trouble , because we had no future . We made no more provision for growing older , than we did for growing younger . We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty , who used to whisper of an evening when we sat , lovingly , on our little locker side by side , ‘ Lor ! wasn ’ t it beautiful ! ’ Mr. Peggotty smiled at us from behind his pipe , and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing else . They had something of the sort of pleasure in us , I suppose , that they might have had in a pretty toy , or a pocket model of the Colosseum . I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so agreeable as she might have been expected to do , under the circumstances of her residence with Mr. Peggotty . Mrs. Gummidge ’ s was rather a fretful disposition , and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment . I was very sorry for her ; but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable , I thought , if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to retire to , and had stopped there until her spirits revived . Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public-house called The Willing Mind . I discovered this , by his being out on the second or third evening of our visit , and by Mrs. Gummidge ’ s looking up at the Dutch clock , between eight and nine , and saying he was there , and that , what was more , she had known in the morning he would go there . Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day , and had burst into tears in the forenoon , when the fire smoked . ‘ I am a lone lorn creetur ’ , ’ were Mrs. Gummidge ’ s words , when that unpleasant occurrence took place , ‘ and everythink goes contrary with me. ’ ‘ Oh , it ’ ll soon leave off , ’ said Peggotty -- I again mean our Peggotty -- ‘ and besides , you know , it ’ s not more disagreeable to you than to us. ’ ‘ I feel it more , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge . It was a very cold day , with cutting blasts of wind . Mrs. Gummidge ’ s peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and snuggest in the place , as her chair was certainly the easiest , but it didn ’ t suit her that day at all . She was constantly complaining of the cold , and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called ‘ the creeps ’ . At last she shed tears on that subject , and said again that she was ‘ a lone lorn creetur ’ and everythink went contrary with her ’ . ‘ It is certainly very cold , ’ said Peggotty . ‘ Everybody must feel it so. ’ ‘ I feel it more than other people , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge . So at dinner ; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately after me , to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction . The fish were small and bony , and the potatoes were a little burnt . We all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment ; but Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we did , and shed tears again , and made that former declaration with great bitterness . Accordingly , when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o ’ clock , this unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner , in a very wretched and miserable condition . Peggotty had been working cheerfully . Ham had been patching up a great pair of waterboots ; and I , with little Em ’ ly by my side , had been reading to them . Mrs. Gummidge had never made any other remark than a forlorn sigh , and had never raised her eyes since tea . ‘ Well , Mates , ’ said Mr. Peggotty , taking his seat , ‘ and how are you ? ’ We all said something , or looked something , to welcome him , except Mrs. Gummidge , who only shook her head over her knitting . ‘ What ’ s amiss ? ’ said Mr. Peggotty , with a clap of his hands . ‘ Cheer up , old Mawther ! ’ ( Mr. Peggotty meant old girl . ) Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up . She took out an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes ; but instead of putting it in her pocket , kept it out , and wiped them again , and still kept it out , ready for use . ‘ What ’ s amiss , dame ? ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Nothing , ’ returned Mrs. Gummidge . ‘ You ’ ve come from The Willing Mind , Dan ’ l ? ’ ‘ Why yes , I ’ ve took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight , ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ I ’ m sorry I should drive you there , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge . ‘ Drive ! I don ’ t want no driving , ’ returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest laugh . ‘ I only go too ready. ’ ‘ Very ready , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge , shaking her head , and wiping her eyes . ‘ Yes , yes , very ready . I am sorry it should be along of me that you ’ re so ready. ’ ‘ Along o ’ you ! It an ’ t along o ’ you ! ’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘ Don ’ t ye believe a bit on it. ’ ‘ Yes , yes , it is , ’ cried Mrs. Gummidge . ‘ I know what I am . I know that I am a lone lorn creetur ’ , and not only that everythink goes contrary with me , but that I go contrary with everybody . Yes , yes . I feel more than other people do , and I show it more . It ’ s my misfortun ’ . ’ I really couldn ’ t help thinking , as I sat taking in all this , that the misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs. Gummidge . But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort , only answering with another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up . ‘ I an ’ t what I could wish myself to be , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge . ‘ I am far from it . I know what I am . My troubles has made me contrary . I feel my troubles , and they make me contrary . I wish I didn ’ t feel ‘ em , but I do . I wish I could be hardened to ‘ em , but I an ’ t . I make the house uncomfortable . I don ’ t wonder at it . I ’ ve made your sister so all day , and Master Davy. ’ Here I was suddenly melted , and roared out , ‘ No , you haven ’ t , Mrs. Gummidge , ’ in great mental distress . ‘ It ’ s far from right that I should do it , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge . ‘ It an ’ t a fit return . I had better go into the house and die . I am a lone lorn creetur ’ , and had much better not make myself contrary here . If thinks must go contrary with me , and I must go contrary myself , let me go contrary in my parish . Dan ’ l , I ’ d better go into the house , and die and be a riddance ! ’ Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words , and betook herself to bed . When she was gone , Mr. Peggotty , who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling but the profoundest sympathy , looked round upon us , and nodding his head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face , said in a whisper : ‘ She ’ s been thinking of the old ‘ un ! ’ I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed to have fixed her mind upon , until Peggotty , on seeing me to bed , explained that it was the late Mr. Gummidge ; and that her brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions , and that it always had a moving effect upon him . Some time after he was in his hammock that night , I heard him myself repeat to Ham , ‘ Poor thing ! She ’ s been thinking of the old ‘ un ! ’ And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder of our stay ( which happened some few times ) , he always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance , and always with the tenderest commiseration . So the fortnight slipped away , varied by nothing but the variation of the tide , which altered Mr. Peggotty ’ s times of going out and coming in , and altered Ham ’ s engagements also . When the latter was unemployed , he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships , and once or twice he took us for a row . I don ’ t know why one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than another , though I believe this obtains with most people , in reference especially to the associations of their childhood . I never hear the name , or read the name , of Yarmouth , but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on the beach , the bells ringing for church , little Em ’ ly leaning on my shoulder , Ham lazily dropping stones into the water , and the sun , away at sea , just breaking through the heavy mist , and showing us the ships , like their own shadows . At last the day came for going home . I bore up against the separation from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge , but my agony of mind at leaving little Em ’ ly was piercing . We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where the carrier put up , and I promised , on the road , to write to her . ( I redeemed that promise afterwards , in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript , as being to let . ) We were greatly overcome at parting ; and if ever , in my life , I have had a void made in my heart , I had one made that day . Now , all the time I had been on my visit , I had been ungrateful to my home again , and had thought little or nothing about it . But I was no sooner turned towards it , than my reproachful young conscience seemed to point that way with a ready finger ; and I felt , all the more for the sinking of my spirits , that it was my nest , and that my mother was my comforter and friend . This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew , the more familiar the objects became that we passed , the more excited I was to get there , and to run into her arms . But Peggotty , instead of sharing in those transports , tried to check them ( though very kindly ) , and looked confused and out of sorts . Blunderstone Rookery would come , however , in spite of her , when the carrier ’ s horse pleased -- and did . How well I recollect it , on a cold grey afternoon , with a dull sky , threatening rain ! The door opened , and I looked , half laughing and half crying in my pleasant agitation , for my mother . It was not she , but a strange servant . ‘ Why , Peggotty ! ’ I said , ruefully , ‘ isn ’ t she come home ? ’ ‘ Yes , yes , Master Davy , ’ said Peggotty . ‘ She ’ s come home . Wait a bit , Master Davy , and I ’ ll -- I ’ ll tell you something. ’ Between her agitation , and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the cart , Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself , but I felt too blank and strange to tell her so . When she had got down , she took me by the hand ; led me , wondering , into the kitchen ; and shut the door . ‘ Peggotty ! ’ said I , quite frightened . ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ Nothing ’ s the matter , bless you , Master Davy dear ! ’ she answered , assuming an air of sprightliness . ‘ Something ’ s the matter , I ’ m sure . Where ’ s mama ? ’ ‘ Where ’ s mama , Master Davy ? ’ repeated Peggotty . ‘ Yes . Why hasn ’ t she come out to the gate , and what have we come in here for ? Oh , Peggotty ! ’ My eyes were full , and I felt as if I were going to tumble down . ‘ Bless the precious boy ! ’ cried Peggotty , taking hold of me . ‘ What is it ? Speak , my pet ! ’ ‘ Not dead , too ! Oh , she ’ s not dead , Peggotty ? ’ Peggotty cried out No ! with an astonishing volume of voice ; and then sat down , and began to pant , and said I had given her a turn . I gave her a hug to take away the turn , or to give her another turn in the right direction , and then stood before her , looking at her in anxious inquiry . ‘ You see , dear , I should have told you before now , ’ said Peggotty , ‘ but I hadn ’ t an opportunity . I ought to have made it , perhaps , but I couldn ’ t azackly ’ -- that was always the substitute for exactly , in Peggotty ’ s militia of words -- ‘ bring my mind to it. ’ ‘ Go on , Peggotty , ’ said I , more frightened than before . ‘ Master Davy , ’ said Peggotty , untying her bonnet with a shaking hand , and speaking in a breathless sort of way . ‘ What do you think ? You have got a Pa ! ’ I trembled , and turned white . Something -- I don ’ t know what , or how -- connected with the grave in the churchyard , and the raising of the dead , seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind . ‘ A new one , ’ said Peggotty . ‘ A new one ? ’ I repeated . Peggotty gave a gasp , as if she were swallowing something that was very hard , and , putting out her hand , said : ‘ Come and see him. ’ ‘ I don ’ t want to see him. ’ -- ‘ And your mama , ’ said Peggotty . I ceased to draw back , and we went straight to the best parlour , where she left me . On one side of the fire , sat my mother ; on the other , Mr. Murdstone . My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought . ‘ Now , Clara my dear , ’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘ Recollect ! control yourself , always control yourself ! Davy boy , how do you do ? ’ I gave him my hand . After a moment of suspense , I went and kissed my mother : she kissed me , patted me gently on the shoulder , and sat down again to her work . I could not look at her , I could not look at him , I knew quite well that he was looking at us both ; and I turned to the window and looked out there , at some shrubs that were drooping their heads in the cold . As soon as I could creep away , I crept upstairs . My old dear bedroom was changed , and I was to lie a long way off . I rambled downstairs to find anything that was like itself , so altered it all seemed ; and roamed into the yard . I very soon started back from there , for the empty dog-kennel was filled up with a great dog -- deep mouthed and black-haired like Him -- and he was very angry at the sight of me , and sprang out to get at me . CHAPTER 4 . I FALL INTO DISGRACE If the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence , I might appeal to it at this day -- who sleeps there now , I wonder ! -- to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to it . I went up there , hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way while I climbed the stairs ; and , looking as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me , sat down with my small hands crossed , and thought . I thought of the oddest things . Of the shape of the room , of the cracks in the ceiling , of the paper on the walls , of the flaws in the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect , of the washing-stand being rickety on its three legs , and having a discontented something about it , which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the influence of the old one . I was crying all the time , but , except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected , I am sure I never thought why I cried . At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little Em ’ ly , and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want me , or to care about me , half as much as she did . This made such a very miserable piece of business of it , that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane , and cried myself to sleep . I was awoke by somebody saying ‘ Here he is ! ’ and uncovering my hot head . My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me , and it was one of them who had done it . ‘ Davy , ’ said my mother . ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ I thought it was very strange that she should ask me , and answered , ‘ Nothing. ’ I turned over on my face , I recollect , to hide my trembling lip , which answered her with greater truth . ‘ Davy , ’ said my mother . ‘ Davy , my child ! ’ I dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me so much , then , as her calling me her child . I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up . ‘ This is your doing , Peggotty , you cruel thing ! ’ said my mother . ‘ I have no doubt at all about it . How can you reconcile it to your conscience , I wonder , to prejudice my own boy against me , or against anybody who is dear to me ? What do you mean by it , Peggotty ? ’ Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes , and only answered , in a sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner , ‘ Lord forgive you , Mrs. Copperfield , and for what you have said this minute , may you never be truly sorry ! ’ ‘ It ’ s enough to distract me , ’ cried my mother . ‘ In my honeymoon , too , when my most inveterate enemy might relent , one would think , and not envy me a little peace of mind and happiness . Davy , you naughty boy ! Peggotty , you savage creature ! Oh , dear me ! ’ cried my mother , turning from one of us to the other , in her pettish wilful manner , ‘ what a troublesome world this is , when one has the most right to expect it to be as agreeable as possible ! ’ I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither hers nor Peggotty ’ s , and slipped to my feet at the bed-side . It was Mr. Murdstone ’ s hand , and he kept it on my arm as he said : ‘ What ’ s this ? Clara , my love , have you forgotten ? -- Firmness , my dear ! ’ ‘ I am very sorry , Edward , ’ said my mother . ‘ I meant to be very good , but I am so uncomfortable. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ he answered . ‘ That ’ s a bad hearing , so soon , Clara. ’ ‘ I say it ’ s very hard I should be made so now , ’ returned my mother , pouting ; ‘ and it is -- very hard -- isn ’ t it ? ’ He drew her to him , whispered in her ear , and kissed her . I knew as well , when I saw my mother ’ s head lean down upon his shoulder , and her arm touch his neck -- I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose , as I know , now , that he did it . ‘ Go you below , my love , ’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘ David and I will come down , together . My friend , ’ turning a darkening face on Peggotty , when he had watched my mother out , and dismissed her with a nod and a smile ; ‘ do you know your mistress ’ s name ? ’ ‘ She has been my mistress a long time , sir , ’ answered Peggotty , ‘ I ought to know it. ’ ‘ That ’ s true , ’ he answered . ‘ But I thought I heard you , as I came upstairs , address her by a name that is not hers . She has taken mine , you know . Will you remember that ? ’ Peggotty , with some uneasy glances at me , curtseyed herself out of the room without replying ; seeing , I suppose , that she was expected to go , and had no excuse for remaining . When we two were left alone , he shut the door , and sitting on a chair , and holding me standing before him , looked steadily into my eyes . I felt my own attracted , no less steadily , to his . As I recall our being opposed thus , face to face , I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high . ‘ David , ’ he said , making his lips thin , by pressing them together , ‘ if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with , what do you think I do ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know. ’ ‘ I beat him. ’ I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper , but I felt , in my silence , that my breath was shorter now . ‘ I make him wince , and smart . I say to myself , “ I ’ ll conquer that fellow ” ; and if it were to cost him all the blood he had , I should do it . What is that upon your face ? ’ ‘ Dirt , ’ I said . He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I . But if he had asked the question twenty times , each time with twenty blows , I believe my baby heart would have burst before I would have told him so . ‘ You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow , ’ he said , with a grave smile that belonged to him , ‘ and you understood me very well , I see . Wash that face , sir , and come down with me. ’ He pointed to the washing-stand , which I had made out to be like Mrs. Gummidge , and motioned me with his head to obey him directly . I had little doubt then , and I have less doubt now , that he would have knocked me down without the least compunction , if I had hesitated . ‘ Clara , my dear , ’ he said , when I had done his bidding , and he walked me into the parlour , with his hand still on my arm ; ‘ you will not be made uncomfortable any more , I hope . We shall soon improve our youthful humours. ’ God help me , I might have been improved for my whole life , I might have been made another creature perhaps , for life , by a kind word at that season . A word of encouragement and explanation , of pity for my childish ignorance , of welcome home , of reassurance to me that it was home , might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth , instead of in my hypocritical outside , and might have made me respect instead of hate him . I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so scared and strange , and that , presently , when I stole to a chair , she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still -- missing , perhaps , some freedom in my childish tread -- but the word was not spoken , and the time for it was gone . We dined alone , we three together . He seemed to be very fond of my mother -- I am afraid I liked him none the better for that -- and she was very fond of him . I gathered from what they said , that an elder sister of his was coming to stay with them , and that she was expected that evening . I am not certain whether I found out then , or afterwards , that , without being actively concerned in any business , he had some share in , or some annual charge upon the profits of , a wine-merchant ’ s house in London , with which his family had been connected from his great-grandfather ’ s time , and in which his sister had a similar interest ; but I may mention it in this place , whether or no . After dinner , when we were sitting by the fire , and I was meditating an escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away , lest it should offend the master of the house , a coach drove up to the garden-gate and he went out to receive the visitor . My mother followed him . I was timidly following her , when she turned round at the parlour door , in the dusk , and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to do , whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him . She did this hurriedly and secretly , as if it were wrong , but tenderly ; and , putting out her hand behind her , held mine in it , until we came near to where he was standing in the garden , where she let mine go , and drew hers through his arm . It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived , and a gloomy-looking lady she was ; dark , like her brother , whom she greatly resembled in face and voice ; and with very heavy eyebrows , nearly meeting over her large nose , as if , being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers , she had carried them to that account . She brought with her two uncompromising hard black boxes , with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails . When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse , and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain , and shut up like a bite . I had never , at that time , seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was . She was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome , and there formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation . Then she looked at me , and said : ‘ Is that your boy , sister-in-law ? ’ My mother acknowledged me . ‘ Generally speaking , ’ said Miss Murdstone , ‘ I don ’ t like boys . How d ’ ye do , boy ? ’ Under these encouraging circumstances , I replied that I was very well , and that I hoped she was the same ; with such an indifferent grace , that Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words : ‘ Wants manner ! ’ Having uttered which , with great distinctness , she begged the favour of being shown to her room , which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread , wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be left unlocked , and where ( for I peeped in once or twice when she was out ) numerous little steel fetters and rivets , with which Miss Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed , generally hung upon the looking-glass in formidable array . As well as I could make out , she had come for good , and had no intention of ever going again . She began to ‘ help ’ my mother next morning , and was in and out of the store-closet all day , putting things to rights , and making havoc in the old arrangements . Almost the first remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was , her being constantly haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere on the premises . Under the influence of this delusion , she dived into the coal-cellar at the most untimely hours , and scarcely ever opened the door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again , in the belief that she had got him . Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone , she was a perfect Lark in point of getting up . She was up ( and , as I believe to this hour , looking for that man ) before anybody in the house was stirring . Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open ; but I could not concur in this idea ; for I tried it myself after hearing the suggestion thrown out , and found it couldn ’ t be done . On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her bell at cock-crow . When my mother came down to breakfast and was going to make the tea , Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek , which was her nearest approach to a kiss , and said : ‘ Now , Clara , my dear , I am come here , you know , to relieve you of all the trouble I can . You ’ re much too pretty and thoughtless ’ -- my mother blushed but laughed , and seemed not to dislike this character -- ‘ to have any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me . If you ’ ll be so good as give me your keys , my dear , I ’ ll attend to all this sort of thing in future. ’ From that time , Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all day , and under her pillow all night , and my mother had no more to do with them than I had . My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow of protest . One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing certain household plans to her brother , of which he signified his approbation , my mother suddenly began to cry , and said she thought she might have been consulted . ‘ Clara ! ’ said Mr. Murdstone sternly . ‘ Clara ! I wonder at you. ’ ‘ Oh , it ’ s very well to say you wonder , Edward ! ’ cried my mother , ‘ and it ’ s very well for you to talk about firmness , but you wouldn ’ t like it yourself. ’ Firmness , I may observe , was the grand quality on which both Mr. and Miss Murdstone took their stand . However I might have expressed my comprehension of it at that time , if I had been called upon , I nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way , that it was another name for tyranny ; and for a certain gloomy , arrogant , devil ’ s humour , that was in them both . The creed , as I should state it now , was this . Mr. Murdstone was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr. Murdstone ; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all , for everybody was to be bent to his firmness . Miss Murdstone was an exception . She might be firm , but only by relationship , and in an inferior and tributary degree . My mother was another exception . She might be firm , and must be ; but only in bearing their firmness , and firmly believing there was no other firmness upon earth . ‘ It ’ s very hard , ’ said my mother , ‘ that in my own house -- ’ ‘ My own house ? ’ repeated Mr. Murdstone . ‘ Clara ! ’ ‘ OUR own house , I mean , ’ faltered my mother , evidently frightened -- ‘ I hope you must know what I mean , Edward -- it ’ s very hard that in YOUR own house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters . I am sure I managed very well before we were married . There ’ s evidence , ’ said my mother , sobbing ; ‘ ask Peggotty if I didn ’ t do very well when I wasn ’ t interfered with ! ’ ‘ Edward , ’ said Miss Murdstone , ‘ let there be an end of this . I go tomorrow. ’ ‘ Jane Murdstone , ’ said her brother , ‘ be silent ! How dare you to insinuate that you don ’ t know my character better than your words imply ? ’ ‘ I am sure , ’ my poor mother went on , at a grievous disadvantage , and with many tears , ‘ I don ’ t want anybody to go . I should be very miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go . I don ’ t ask much . I am not unreasonable . I only want to be consulted sometimes . I am very much obliged to anybody who assists me , and I only want to be consulted as a mere form , sometimes . I thought you were pleased , once , with my being a little inexperienced and girlish , Edward -- I am sure you said so -- but you seem to hate me for it now , you are so severe. ’ ‘ Edward , ’ said Miss Murdstone , again , ‘ let there be an end of this . I go tomorrow. ’ ‘ Jane Murdstone , ’ thundered Mr. Murdstone . ‘ Will you be silent ? How dare you ? ’ Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief , and held it before her eyes . ‘ Clara , ’ he continued , looking at my mother , ‘ you surprise me ! You astound me ! Yes , I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an inexperienced and artless person , and forming her character , and infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in need . But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance in this endeavour , and to assume , for my sake , a condition something like a housekeeper ’ s , and when she meets with a base return -- ’ ‘ Oh , pray , pray , Edward , ’ cried my mother , ‘ don ’ t accuse me of being ungrateful . I am sure I am not ungrateful . No one ever said I was before . I have many faults , but not that . Oh , don ’ t , my dear ! ’ ‘ When Jane Murdstone meets , I say , ’ he went on , after waiting until my mother was silent , ‘ with a base return , that feeling of mine is chilled and altered. ’ ‘ Don ’ t , my love , say that ! ’ implored my mother very piteously . ‘ Oh , don ’ t , Edward ! I can ’ t bear to hear it . Whatever I am , I am affectionate . I know I am affectionate . I wouldn ’ t say it , if I wasn ’ t sure that I am . Ask Peggotty . I am sure she ’ ll tell you I ’ m affectionate. ’ ‘ There is no extent of mere weakness , Clara , ’ said Mr. Murdstone in reply , ‘ that can have the least weight with me . You lose breath. ’ ‘ Pray let us be friends , ’ said my mother , ‘ I couldn ’ t live under coldness or unkindness . I am so sorry . I have a great many defects , I know , and it ’ s very good of you , Edward , with your strength of mind , to endeavour to correct them for me . Jane , I don ’ t object to anything . I should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving -- ’ My mother was too much overcome to go on . ‘ Jane Murdstone , ’ said Mr. Murdstone to his sister , ‘ any harsh words between us are , I hope , uncommon . It is not my fault that so unusual an occurrence has taken place tonight . I was betrayed into it by another . Nor is it your fault . You were betrayed into it by another . Let us both try to forget it . And as this , ’ he added , after these magnanimous words , ‘ is not a fit scene for the boy -- David , go to bed ! ’ I could hardly find the door , through the tears that stood in my eyes . I was so sorry for my mother ’ s distress ; but I groped my way out , and groped my way up to my room in the dark , without even having the heart to say good night to Peggotty , or to get a candle from her . When her coming up to look for me , an hour or so afterwards , awoke me , she said that my mother had gone to bed poorly , and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were sitting alone . Going down next morning rather earlier than usual , I paused outside the parlour door , on hearing my mother ’ s voice . She was very earnestly and humbly entreating Miss Murdstone ’ s pardon , which that lady granted , and a perfect reconciliation took place . I never knew my mother afterwards to give an opinion on any matter , without first appealing to Miss Murdstone , or without having first ascertained by some sure means , what Miss Murdstone ’ s opinion was ; and I never saw Miss Murdstone , when out of temper ( she was infirm that way ) , move her hand towards her bag as if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my mother , without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright . The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood , darkened the Murdstone religion , which was austere and wrathful . I have thought , since , that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr. Murdstone ’ s firmness , which wouldn ’ t allow him to let anybody off from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse for . Be this as it may , I well remember the tremendous visages with which we used to go to church , and the changed air of the place . Again , the dreaded Sunday comes round , and I file into the old pew first , like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service . Again , Miss Murdstone , in a black velvet gown , that looks as if it had been made out of a pall , follows close upon me ; then my mother ; then her husband . There is no Peggotty now , as in the old time . Again , I listen to Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses , and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel relish . Again , I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says ‘ miserable sinners ’ , as if she were calling all the congregation names . Again , I catch rare glimpses of my mother , moving her lips timidly between the two , with one of them muttering at each ear like low thunder . Again , I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong , and Mr. and Miss Murdstone right , and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels . Again , if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face , Miss Murdstone pokes me with her prayer-book , and makes my side ache . Yes , and again , as we walk home , I note some neighbours looking at my mother and at me , and whispering . Again , as the three go on arm-in-arm , and I linger behind alone , I follow some of those looks , and wonder if my mother ’ s step be really not so light as I have seen it , and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away . Again , I wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind , as I do , how we used to walk home together , she and I ; and I wonder stupidly about that , all the dreary dismal day . There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school . Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it , and my mother had of course agreed with them . Nothing , however , was concluded on the subject yet . In the meantime , I learnt lessons at home . Shall I ever forget those lessons ! They were presided over nominally by my mother , but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister , who were always present , and found them a favourable occasion for giving my mother lessons in that miscalled firmness , which was the bane of both our lives . I believe I was kept at home for that purpose . I had been apt enough to learn , and willing enough , when my mother and I had lived alone together . I can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee . To this day , when I look upon the fat black letters in the primer , the puzzling novelty of their shapes , and the easy good-nature of O and Q and S , seem to present themselves again before me as they used to do . But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance . On the contrary , I seem to have walked along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book , and to have been cheered by the gentleness of my mother ’ s voice and manner all the way . But these solemn lessons which succeeded those , I remember as the death-blow of my peace , and a grievous daily drudgery and misery . They were very long , very numerous , very hard -- perfectly unintelligible , some of them , to me -- and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I believe my poor mother was herself . Let me remember how it used to be , and bring one morning back again . I come into the second-best parlour after breakfast , with my books , and an exercise-book , and a slate . My mother is ready for me at her writing-desk , but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the window ( though he pretends to be reading a book ) , or as Miss Murdstone , sitting near my mother stringing steel beads . The very sight of these two has such an influence over me , that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite pains to get into my head , all sliding away , and going I don ’ t know where . I wonder where they do go , by the by ? I hand the first book to my mother . Perhaps it is a grammar , perhaps a history , or geography . I take a last drowning look at the page as I give it into her hand , and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have got it fresh . I trip over a word . Mr. Murdstone looks up . I trip over another word . Miss Murdstone looks up . I redden , tumble over half-a-dozen words , and stop . I think my mother would show me the book if she dared , but she does not dare , and she says softly : ‘ Oh , Davy , Davy ! ’ ‘ Now , Clara , ’ says Mr. Murdstone , ‘ be firm with the boy . Don ’ t say , “ Oh , Davy , Davy ! ” That ’ s childish . He knows his lesson , or he does not know it. ’ ‘ He does NOT know it , ’ Miss Murdstone interposes awfully . ‘ I am really afraid he does not , ’ says my mother . ‘ Then , you see , Clara , ’ returns Miss Murdstone , ‘ you should just give him the book back , and make him know it. ’ ‘ Yes , certainly , ’ says my mother ; ‘ that is what I intend to do , my dear Jane . Now , Davy , try once more , and don ’ t be stupid. ’ I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more , but am not so successful with the second , for I am very stupid . I tumble down before I get to the old place , at a point where I was all right before , and stop to think . But I can ’ t think about the lesson . I think of the number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone ’ s cap , or of the price of Mr. Murdstone ’ s dressing-gown , or any such ridiculous problem that I have no business with , and don ’ t want to have anything at all to do with . Mr. Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been expecting for a long time . Miss Murdstone does the same . My mother glances submissively at them , shuts the book , and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done . There is a pile of these arrears very soon , and it swells like a rolling snowball . The bigger it gets , the more stupid I get . The case is so hopeless , and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense , that I give up all idea of getting out , and abandon myself to my fate . The despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other , as I blunder on , is truly melancholy . But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother ( thinking nobody is observing her ) tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips . At that instant , Miss Murdstone , who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along , says in a deep warning voice : ‘ Clara ! ’ My mother starts , colours , and smiles faintly . Mr. Murdstone comes out of his chair , takes the book , throws it at me or boxes my ears with it , and turns me out of the room by the shoulders . Even when the lessons are done , the worst is yet to happen , in the shape of an appalling sum . This is invented for me , and delivered to me orally by Mr. Murdstone , and begins , ‘ If I go into a cheesemonger ’ s shop , and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each , present payment ’ -- at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed . I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until dinner-time , when , having made a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin , I have a slice of bread to help me out with the cheeses , and am considered in disgrace for the rest of the evening . It seems to me , at this distance of time , as if my unfortunate studies generally took this course . I could have done very well if I had been without the Murdstones ; but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird . Even when I did get through the morning with tolerable credit , there was not much gained but dinner ; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me untasked , and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed , called her brother ’ s attention to me by saying , ‘ Clara , my dear , there ’ s nothing like work -- give your boy an exercise ’ ; which caused me to be clapped down to some new labour , there and then . As to any recreation with other children of my age , I had very little of that ; for the gloomy theology of the Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers ( though there WAS a child once set in the midst of the Disciples ) , and held that they contaminated one another . The natural result of this treatment , continued , I suppose , for some six months or more , was to make me sullen , dull , and dogged . I was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother . I believe I should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance . It was this . My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs , to which I had access ( for it adjoined my own ) and which nobody else in our house ever troubled . From that blessed little room , Roderick Random , Peregrine Pickle , Humphrey Clinker , Tom Jones , the Vicar of Wakefield , Don Quixote , Gil Blas , and Robinson Crusoe , came out , a glorious host , to keep me company . They kept alive my fancy , and my hope of something beyond that place and time , -- they , and the Arabian Nights , and the Tales of the Genii , -- and did me no harm ; for whatever harm was in some of them was not there for me ; I knew nothing of it . It is astonishing to me now , how I found time , in the midst of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes , to read those books as I did . It is curious to me how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles ( which were great troubles to me ) , by impersonating my favourite characters in them -- as I did -- and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad ones -- which I did too . I have been Tom Jones ( a child ’ s Tom Jones , a harmless creature ) for a week together . I have sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch , I verily believe . I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels -- I forget what , now -- that were on those shelves ; and for days and days I can remember to have gone about my region of our house , armed with the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees -- the perfect realization of Captain Somebody , of the Royal British Navy , in danger of being beset by savages , and resolved to sell his life at a great price . The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar . I did ; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero , in despite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world , dead or alive . This was my only and my constant comfort . When I think of it , the picture always rises in my mind , of a summer evening , the boys at play in the churchyard , and I sitting on my bed , reading as if for life . Every barn in the neighbourhood , every stone in the church , and every foot of the churchyard , had some association of its own , in my mind , connected with these books , and stood for some locality made famous in them . I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple ; I have watched Strap , with the knapsack on his back , stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-gate ; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with Mr. Pickle , in the parlour of our little village alehouse . The reader now understands , as well as I do , what I was when I came to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again . One morning when I went into the parlour with my books , I found my mother looking anxious , Miss Murdstone looking firm , and Mr. Murdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane -- a lithe and limber cane , which he left off binding when I came in , and poised and switched in the air . ‘ I tell you , Clara , ’ said Mr. Murdstone , ‘ I have been often flogged myself. ’ ‘ To be sure ; of course , ’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘ Certainly , my dear Jane , ’ faltered my mother , meekly . ‘ But -- but do you think it did Edward good ? ’ ‘ Do you think it did Edward harm , Clara ? ’ asked Mr. Murdstone , gravely . ‘ That ’ s the point , ’ said his sister . To this my mother returned , ‘ Certainly , my dear Jane , ’ and said no more . I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue , and sought Mr. Murdstone ’ s eye as it lighted on mine . ‘ Now , David , ’ he said -- and I saw that cast again as he said it -- ‘ you must be far more careful today than usual. ’ He gave the cane another poise , and another switch ; and having finished his preparation of it , laid it down beside him , with an impressive look , and took up his book . This was a good freshener to my presence of mind , as a beginning . I felt the words of my lessons slipping off , not one by one , or line by line , but by the entire page ; I tried to lay hold of them ; but they seemed , if I may so express it , to have put skates on , and to skim away from me with a smoothness there was no checking . We began badly , and went on worse . I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather , conceiving that I was very well prepared ; but it turned out to be quite a mistake . Book after book was added to the heap of failures , Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the time . And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses ( canes he made it that day , I remember ) , my mother burst out crying . ‘ Clara ! ’ said Miss Murdstone , in her warning voice . ‘ I am not quite well , my dear Jane , I think , ’ said my mother . I saw him wink , solemnly , at his sister , as he rose and said , taking up the cane : ‘ Why , Jane , we can hardly expect Clara to bear , with perfect firmness , the worry and torment that David has occasioned her today . That would be stoical . Clara is greatly strengthened and improved , but we can hardly expect so much from her . David , you and I will go upstairs , boy. ’ As he took me out at the door , my mother ran towards us . Miss Murdstone said , ‘ Clara ! are you a perfect fool ? ’ and interfered . I saw my mother stop her ears then , and I heard her crying . He walked me up to my room slowly and gravely -- I am certain he had a delight in that formal parade of executing justice -- and when we got there , suddenly twisted my head under his arm . ‘ Mr . Murdstone ! Sir ! ’ I cried to him . ‘ Don ’ t ! Pray don ’ t beat me ! I have tried to learn , sir , but I can ’ t learn while you and Miss Murdstone are by . I can ’ t indeed ! ’ ‘ Can ’ t you , indeed , David ? ’ he said . ‘ We ’ ll try that. ’ He had my head as in a vice , but I twined round him somehow , and stopped him for a moment , entreating him not to beat me . It was only a moment that I stopped him , for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards , and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth , between my teeth , and bit it through . It sets my teeth on edge to think of it . He beat me then , as if he would have beaten me to death . Above all the noise we made , I heard them running up the stairs , and crying out -- I heard my mother crying out -- and Peggotty . Then he was gone ; and the door was locked outside ; and I was lying , fevered and hot , and torn , and sore , and raging in my puny way , upon the floor . How well I recollect , when I became quiet , what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign through the whole house ! How well I remember , when my smart and passion began to cool , how wicked I began to feel ! I sat listening for a long while , but there was not a sound . I crawled up from the floor , and saw my face in the glass , so swollen , red , and ugly that it almost frightened me . My stripes were sore and stiff , and made me cry afresh , when I moved ; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt . It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal , I dare say . It had begun to grow dark , and I had shut the window ( I had been lying , for the most part , with my head upon the sill , by turns crying , dozing , and looking listlessly out ) , when the key was turned , and Miss Murdstone came in with some bread and meat , and milk . These she put down upon the table without a word , glaring at",David Copperfield

If it points out an evil at any rate it suggests no remedy . CHAPTER I FRANCESCA BASSINGTON sat in the drawing-room of her house in Blue Street , W. , regaling herself and her estimable brother Henry with China tea and small cress sandwiches . The meal was of that elegant proportion which , while ministering sympathetically to the desires of the moment , is happily reminiscent of a satisfactory luncheon and blessedly expectant of an elaborate dinner to come . In her younger days Francesca had been known as the beautiful Miss Greech ; at forty , although much of the original beauty remained , she was just dear Francesca Bassington . No one would have dreamed of calling her sweet , but a good many people who scarcely knew her were punctilious about putting in the “ dear. ” Her enemies , in their honester moments , would have admitted that she was svelte and knew how to dress , but they would have agreed with her friends in asserting that she had no soul . When one ’ s friends and enemies agree on any particular point they are usually wrong . Francesca herself , if pressed in an unguarded moment to describe her soul , would probably have described her drawing-room . Not that she would have considered that the one had stamped the impress of its character on the other , so that close scrutiny might reveal its outstanding features , and even suggest its hidden places , but because she might have dimly recognised that her drawing-room was her soul . Francesca was one of those women towards whom Fate appears to have the best intentions and never to carry them into practice . With the advantages put at her disposal she might have been expected to command a more than average share of feminine happiness . So many of the things that make for fretfulness , disappointment and discouragement in a woman ’ s life were removed from her path that she might well have been considered the fortunate Miss Greech , or later , lucky Francesca Bassington . And she was not of the perverse band of those who make a rock-garden of their souls by dragging into them all the stoney griefs and unclaimed troubles they can find lying around them . Francesca loved the smooth ways and pleasant places of life ; she liked not merely to look on the bright side of things but to live there and stay there . And the fact that things had , at one time and another , gone badly with her and cheated her of some of her early illusions made her cling the closer to such good fortune as remained to her now that she seemed to have reached a calmer period of her life . To undiscriminating friends she appeared in the guise of a rather selfish woman , but it was merely the selfishness of one who had seen the happy and unhappy sides of life and wished to enjoy to the utmost what was left to her of the former . The vicissitudes of fortune had not soured her , but they had perhaps narrowed her in the sense of making her concentrate much of her sympathies on things that immediately pleased and amused her , or that recalled and perpetuated the pleasing and successful incidents of other days . And it was her drawing-room in particular that enshrined the memorials or tokens of past and present happiness . Into that comfortable quaint-shaped room of angles and bays and alcoves had sailed , as into a harbour , those precious personal possessions and trophies that had survived the buffetings and storms of a not very tranquil married life . Wherever her eyes might turn she saw the embodied results of her successes , economies , good luck , good management or good taste . The battle had more than once gone against her , but she had somehow always contrived to save her baggage train , and her complacent gaze could roam over object after object that represented the spoils of victory or the salvage of honourable defeat . The delicious bronze Fremiet on the mantelpiece had been the outcome of a Grand Prix sweepstake of many years ago ; a group of Dresden figures of some considerable value had been bequeathed to her by a discreet admirer , who had added death to his other kindnesses ; another group had been a self-bestowed present , purchased in blessed and unfading memory of a wonderful nine-days ’ bridge winnings at a country-house party . There were old Persian and Bokharan rugs and Worcester tea-services of glowing colour , and little treasures of antique silver that each enshrined a history or a memory in addition to its own intrinsic value . It amused her at times to think of the bygone craftsmen and artificers who had hammered and wrought and woven in far distant countries and ages , to produce the wonderful and beautiful things that had come , one way and another , into her possession . Workers in the studios of medieval Italian towns and of later Paris , in the bazaars of Baghdad and of Central Asia , in old-time English workshops and German factories , in all manner of queer hidden corners where craft secrets were jealously guarded , nameless unremembered men and men whose names were world-renowned and deathless . And above all her other treasures , dominating in her estimation every other object that the room contained , was the great Van der Meulen that had come from her father ’ s home as part of her wedding dowry . It fitted exactly into the central wall panel above the narrow buhl cabinet , and filled exactly its right space in the composition and balance of the room . From wherever you sat it seemed to confront you as the dominating feature of its surroundings . There was a pleasing serenity about the great pompous battle scene with its solemn courtly warriors bestriding their heavily prancing steeds , grey or skewbald or dun , all gravely in earnest , and yet somehow conveying the impression that their campaigns were but vast serious picnics arranged in the grand manner . Francesca could not imagine the drawing-room without the crowning complement of the stately well-hung picture , just as she could not imagine herself in any other setting than this house in Blue Street with its crowded Pantheon of cherished household gods . And herein sprouted one of the thorns that obtruded through the rose-leaf damask of what might otherwise have been Francesca ’ s peace of mind . One ’ s happiness always lies in the future rather than in the past . With due deference to an esteemed lyrical authority one may safely say that a sorrow ’ s crown of sorrow is anticipating unhappier things . The house in Blue Street had been left to her by her old friend Sophie Chetrof , but only until such time as her niece Emmeline Chetrof should marry , when it was to pass to her as a wedding present . Emmeline was now seventeen and passably good-looking , and four or five years were all that could be safely allotted to the span of her continued spinsterhood . Beyond that period lay chaos , the wrenching asunder of Francesca from the sheltering habitation that had grown to be her soul . It is true that in imagination she had built herself a bridge across the chasm , a bridge of a single span . The bridge in question was her schoolboy son Comus , now being educated somewhere in the southern counties , or rather one should say the bridge consisted of the possibility of his eventual marriage with Emmeline , in which case Francesca saw herself still reigning , a trifle squeezed and incommoded perhaps , but still reigning in the house in Blue Street . The Van der Meulen would still catch its requisite afternoon light in its place of honour , the Fremiet and the Dresden and Old Worcester would continue undisturbed in their accustomed niches . Emmeline could have the Japanese snuggery , where Francesca sometimes drank her after-dinner coffee , as a separate drawing-room , where she could put her own things . The details of the bridge structure had all been carefully thought out . Only—it was an unfortunate circumstance that Comus should have been the span on which everything balanced . Francesca ’ s husband had insisted on giving the boy that strange Pagan name , and had not lived long enough to judge as to the appropriateness , or otherwise , of its significance . In seventeen years and some odd months Francesca had had ample opportunity for forming an opinion concerning her son ’ s characteristics . The spirit of mirthfulness which one associates with the name certainly ran riot in the boy , but it was a twisted wayward sort of mirth of which Francesca herself could seldom see the humorous side . In her brother Henry , who sat eating small cress sandwiches as solemnly as though they had been ordained in some immemorial Book of Observances , fate had been undisguisedly kind to her . He might so easily have married some pretty helpless little woman , and lived at Notting Hill Gate , and been the father of a long string of pale , clever useless children , who would have had birthdays and the sort of illnesses that one is expected to send grapes to , and who would have painted fatuous objects in a South Kensington manner as Christmas offerings to an aunt whose cubic space for lumber was limited . Instead of committing these unbrotherly actions , which are so frequent in family life that they might almost be called brotherly , Henry had married a woman who had both money and a sense of repose , and their one child had the brilliant virtue of never saying anything which even its parents could consider worth repeating . Then he had gone into Parliament , possibly with the idea of making his home life seem less dull ; at any rate it redeemed his career from insignificance , for no man whose death can produce the item “ another by-election ” on the news posters can be wholly a nonentity . Henry , in short , who might have been an embarrassment and a handicap , had chosen rather to be a friend and counsellor , at times even an emergency bank balance ; Francesca on her part , with the partiality which a clever and lazily-inclined woman often feels for a reliable fool , not only sought his counsel but frequently followed it . When convenient , moreover , she repaid his loans . Against this good service on the part of Fate in providing her with Henry for a brother , Francesca could well set the plaguy malice of the destiny that had given her Comus for a son . The boy was one of those untameable young lords of misrule that frolic and chafe themselves through nursery and preparatory and public-school days with the utmost allowance of storm and dust and dislocation and the least possible amount of collar-work , and come somehow with a laugh through a series of catastrophes that has reduced everyone else concerned to tears or Cassandra-like forebodings . Sometimes they sober down in after-life and become uninteresting , forgetting that they were ever lords of anything ; sometimes Fate plays royally into their hands , and they do great things in a spacious manner , and are thanked by Parliaments and the Press and acclaimed by gala-day crowds . But in most cases their tragedy begins when they leave school and turn themselves loose in a world that has grown too civilised and too crowded and too empty to have any place for them . And they are very many . Henry Greech had made an end of biting small sandwiches , and settled down like a dust-storm refreshed , to discuss one of the fashionably prevalent topics of the moment , the prevention of destitution . “ It is a question that is only being nibbled at , smelt at , one might say , at the present moment , ” he observed , “ but it is one that will have to engage our serious attention and consideration before long . The first thing that we shall have to do is to get out of the dilettante and academic way of approaching it . We must collect and assimilate hard facts . It is a subject that ought to appeal to all thinking minds , and yet , you know , I find it surprisingly difficult to interest people in it. ” Francesca made some monosyllabic response , a sort of sympathetic grunt which was meant to indicate that she was , to a certain extent , listening and appreciating . In reality she was reflecting that Henry possibly found it difficult to interest people in any topic that he enlarged on . His talents lay so thoroughly in the direction of being uninteresting , that even as an eye-witness of the massacre of St. Bartholomew he would probably have infused a flavour of boredom into his descriptions of the event . “ I was speaking down in Leicestershire the other day on this subject , ” continued Henry , “ and I pointed out at some length a thing that few people ever stop to consider— ” Francesca went over immediately but decorously to the majority that will not stop to consider . “ Did you come across any of the Barnets when you were down there ? ” she interrupted ; “ Eliza Barnet is rather taken up with all those subjects. ” In the propagandist movements of Sociology , as in other arenas of life and struggle , the fiercest competition and rivalry is frequently to be found between closely allied types and species . Eliza Barnet shared many of Henry Greech ’ s political and social views , but she also shared his fondness for pointing things out at some length ; there had been occasions when she had extensively occupied the strictly limited span allotted to the platform oratory of a group of speakers of whom Henry Greech had been an impatient unit . He might see eye to eye with her on the leading questions of the day , but he persistently wore mental blinkers as far as her estimable qualities were concerned , and the mention of her name was a skilful lure drawn across the trail of his discourse ; if Francesca had to listen to his eloquence on any subject she much preferred that it should be a disparagement of Eliza Barnet rather than the prevention of destitution . “ I ’ ve no doubt she means well , ” said Henry , “ but it would be a good thing if she could be induced to keep her own personality a little more in the background , and not to imagine that she is the necessary mouthpiece of all the progressive thought in the countryside . I fancy Canon Besomley must have had her in his mind when he said that some people came into the world to shake empires and others to move amendments. ” Francesca laughed with genuine amusement . “ I suppose she is really wonderfully well up in all the subjects she talks about , ” was her provocative comment . Henry grew possibly conscious of the fact that he was being drawn out on the subject of Eliza Barnet , and he presently turned on to a more personal topic . “ From the general air of tranquillity about the house I presume Comus has gone back to Thaleby , ” he observed . “ Yes , ” said Francesca , “ he went back yesterday . Of course , I ’ m very fond of him , but I bear the separation well . When he ’ s here it ’ s rather like having a live volcano in the house , a volcano that in its quietest moments asks incessant questions and uses strong scent. ” “ It is only a temporary respite , ” said Henry ; “ in a year or two he will be leaving school , and then what ? ” Francesca closed her eyes with the air of one who seeks to shut out a distressing vision . She was not fond of looking intimately at the future in the presence of another person , especially when the future was draped in doubtfully auspicious colours . “ And then what ? ” persisted Henry . “ Then I suppose he will be upon my hands. ” “ Exactly. ” “ Don ’ t sit there looking judicial . I ’ m quite ready to listen to suggestions if you ’ ve any to make. ” “ In the case of any ordinary boy , ” said Henry , “ I might make lots of suggestions as to the finding of suitable employment . From what we know of Comus it would be rather a waste of time for either of us to look for jobs which he wouldn ’ t look at when we ’ d got them for him. ” “ He must do something , ” said Francesca . “ I know he must ; but he never will . At least , he ’ ll never stick to anything . The most hopeful thing to do with him will be to marry him to an heiress . That would solve the financial side of his problem . If he had unlimited money at his disposal , he might go into the wilds somewhere and shoot big game . I never know what the big game have done to deserve it , but they do help to deflect the destructive energies of some of our social misfits. ” Henry , who never killed anything larger or fiercer than a trout , was scornfully superior on the subject of big game shooting . Francesca brightened at the matrimonial suggestion . “ I don ’ t know about an heiress , ” she said reflectively . “ There ’ s Emmeline Chetrof of course . One could hardly call her an heiress , but she ’ s got a comfortable little income of her own and I suppose something more will come to her from her grandmother . Then , of course , you know this house goes to her when she marries. ” “ That would be very convenient , ” said Henry , probably following a line of thought that his sister had trodden many hundreds of times before him . “ Do she and Comus hit it off at all well together ? ” “ Oh , well enough in boy and girl fashion , ” said Francesca . “ I must arrange for them to see more of each other in future . By the way , that little brother of hers that she dotes on , Lancelot , goes to Thaleby this term . I ’ ll write and tell Comus to be specially kind to him ; that will be a sure way to Emmeline ’ s heart . Comus has been made a prefect , you know . Heaven knows why. ” “ It can only be for prominence in games , ” sniffed Henry ; “ I think we may safely leave work and conduct out of the question. ” Comus was not a favourite with his uncle . Francesca had turned to her writing cabinet and was hastily scribbling a letter to her son in which the delicate health , timid disposition and other inevitable attributes of the new boy were brought to his notice , and commanded to his care . When she had sealed and stamped the envelope Henry uttered a belated caution . “ Perhaps on the whole it would be wiser to say nothing about the boy to Comus . He doesn ’ t always respond to directions you know. ” Francesca did know , and already was more than half of her brother ’ s opinion ; but the woman who can sacrifice a clean unspoiled penny stamp is probably yet unborn . CHAPTER II LANCELOT CHETROF stood at the end of a long bare passage , restlessly consulting his watch and fervently wishing himself half an hour older with a certain painful experience already registered in the past ; unfortunately it still belonged to the future , and what was still more horrible , to the immediate future . Like many boys new to a school he had cultivated an unhealthy passion for obeying rules and requirements , and his zeal in this direction had proved his undoing . In his hurry to be doing two or three estimable things at once he had omitted to study the notice-board in more than a perfunctory fashion and had thereby missed a football practice specially ordained for newly-joined boys . His fellow juniors of a term ’ s longer standing had graphically enlightened him as to the inevitable consequences of his lapse ; the dread which attaches to the unknown was , at any rate , deleted from his approaching doom , though at the moment he felt scarcely grateful for the knowledge placed at his disposal with such lavish solicitude . “ You ’ ll get six of the very best , over the back of a chair , ” said one . “ They ’ ll draw a chalk line across you , of course you know , ” said another . “ A chalk line ? ” “ Rather . So that every cut can be aimed exactly at the same spot . It hurts much more that way. ” Lancelot tried to nourish a wan hope that there might be an element of exaggeration in this uncomfortably realistic description . Meanwhile in the prefects ’ room at the other end of the passage , Comus Bassington and a fellow prefect sat also waiting on time , but in a mood of far more pleasurable expectancy . Comus was one of the most junior of the prefect caste , but by no means the least well-known , and outside the masters ’ common-room he enjoyed a certain fitful popularity , or at any rate admiration . At football he was too erratic to be a really brilliant player , but he tackled as if the act of bringing his man headlong to the ground was in itself a sensuous pleasure , and his weird swear-words whenever he got hurt were eagerly treasured by those who were fortunate enough to hear them . At athletics in general he was a showy performer , and although new to the functions of a prefect he had already established a reputation as an effective and artistic caner . In appearance he exactly fitted his fanciful Pagan name . His large green-grey eyes seemed for ever asparkle with goblin mischief and the joy of revelry , and the curved lips might have been those of some wickedly-laughing faun ; one almost expected to see embryo horns fretting the smoothness of his sleek dark hair . The chin was firm , but one looked in vain for a redeeming touch of ill-temper in the handsome , half-mocking , half-petulant face . With a strain of sourness in him Comus might have been leavened into something creative and masterful ; fate had fashioned him with a certain whimsical charm , and left him all unequipped for the greater purposes of life . Perhaps no one would have called him a lovable character , but in many respects he was adorable ; in all respects he was certainly damned . Rutley , his companion of the moment , sat watching him and wondering , from the depths of a very ordinary brain , whether he liked or hated him ; it was easy to do either . “ It ’ s not really your turn to cane , ” he said . “ I know it ’ s not , ” said Comus , fingering a very serviceable-looking cane as lovingly as a pious violinist might handle his Strad . “ I gave Greyson some mint-chocolate to let me toss whether I caned or him , and I won . He was rather decent over it and let me have half the chocolate back. ” The droll lightheartedness which won Comus Bassington such measure of popularity as he enjoyed among his fellows did not materially help to endear him to the succession of masters with whom he came in contact during the course of his schooldays . He amused and interested such of them as had the saving grace of humour at their disposal , but if they sighed when he passed from their immediate responsibility it was a sigh of relief rather than of regret . The more enlightened and experienced of them realised that he was something outside the scope of the things that they were called upon to deal with . A man who has been trained to cope with storms , to foresee their coming , and to minimise their consequences , may be pardoned if he feels a certain reluctance to measure himself against a tornado . Men of more limited outlook and with a correspondingly larger belief in their own powers were ready to tackle the tornado had time permitted . “ I think I could tame young Bassington if I had your opportunities , ” a form-master once remarked to a colleague whose House had the embarrassing distinction of numbering Comus among its inmates . “ Heaven forbid that I should try , ” replied the housemaster . “ But why ? ” asked the reformer . “ Because Nature hates any interference with her own arrangements , and if you start in to tame the obviously untameable you are taking a fearful responsibility on yourself. ” “ Nonsense ; boys are Nature ’ s raw material. ” “ Millions of boys are . There are just a few , and Bassington is one of them , who are Nature ’ s highly finished product when they are in the schoolboy stage , and we , who are supposed to be moulding raw material , are quite helpless when we come in contact with them. ” “ But what happens to them when they grow up ? ” “ They never do grow up , ” said the housemaster ; “ that is their tragedy . Bassington will certainly never grow out of his present stage. ” “ Now you are talking in the language of Peter Pan , ” said the form-master . “ I am not thinking in the manner of Peter Pan , ” said the other . “ With all reverence for the author of that masterpiece I should say he had a wonderful and tender insight into the child mind and knew nothing whatever about boys . To make only one criticism on that particular work , can you imagine a lot of British boys , or boys of any country that one knows of , who would stay contentedly playing children ’ s games in an underground cave when there were wolves and pirates and Red Indians to be had for the asking on the other side of the trap door ? ” The form-master laughed . “ You evidently think that the ‘ Boy who would not grow up ’ must have been written by a ‘ grown-up who could never have been a boy. ’ Perhaps that is the meaning of the ‘ Never-never Land. ’ I daresay you ’ re right in your criticism , but I don ’ t agree with you about Bassington . He ’ s a handful to deal with , as anyone knows who has come in contact with him , but if one ’ s hands weren ’ t full with a thousand and one other things I hold to my opinion that he could be tamed. ” And he went his way , having maintained a form-master ’ s inalienable privilege of being in the right . * * * * * In the prefects ’ room , Comus busied himself with the exact position of a chair planted out in the middle of the floor . “ I think everything ’ s ready , ” he said . Rutley glanced at the clock with the air of a Roman elegant in the Circus , languidly awaiting the introduction of an expected Christian to an expectant tiger . “ The kid is due in two minutes , ” he said . “ He ’ d jolly well better not be late , ” said Comus . Comus had gone through the mill of many scorching castigations in his earlier school days , and was able to appreciate to the last ounce the panic that must be now possessing his foredoomed victim , probably at this moment hovering miserably outside the door . After all , that was part of the fun of the thing , and most things have their amusing side if one knows where to look for it . There was a knock at the door , and Lancelot entered in response to a hearty friendly summons to “ come in. ” “ I ’ ve come to be caned , ” he said breathlessly ; adding by way of identification , “ my name ’ s Chetrof. ” “ That ’ s quite bad enough in itself , ” said Comus , “ but there is probably worse to follow . You are evidently keeping something back from us. ” “ I missed a footer practice , ” said Lancelot “ Six , ” said Comus briefly , picking up his cane . “ I didn ’ t see the notice on the board , ” hazarded Lancelot as a forlorn hope . “ We are always pleased to listen to excuses , and our charge is two extra cuts . That will be eight . Get over. ” And Comus indicated the chair that stood in sinister isolation in the middle of the room . Never had an article of furniture seemed more hateful in Lancelot ’ s eyes . Comus could well remember the time when a chair stuck in the middle of a room had seemed to him the most horrible of manufactured things . “ Lend me a piece of chalk , ” he said to his brother prefect . Lancelot ruefully recognised the truth of the chalk-line story . Comus drew the desired line with an anxious exactitude which he would have scorned to apply to a diagram of Euclid or a map of the Russo-Persian frontier . “ Bend a little more forward , ” he said to the victim , “ and much tighter . Don ’ t trouble to look pleasant , because I can ’ t see your face anyway . It may sound unorthodox to say so , but this is going to hurt you much more than it will hurt me. ” There was a carefully measured pause , and then Lancelot was made vividly aware of what a good cane can be made to do in really efficient hands . At the second cut he projected himself hurriedly off the chair . “ Now I ’ ve lost count , ” said Comus ; “ we shall have to begin all over again . Kindly get back into the same position . If you get down again before I ’ ve finished Rutley will hold you over and you ’ ll get a dozen. ” Lancelot got back on to the chair , and was re-arranged to the taste of his executioner . He stayed there somehow or other while Comus made eight accurate and agonisingly effective shots at the chalk line . “ By the way , ” he said to his gasping and gulping victim when the infliction was over , “ you said Chetrof , didn ’ t you ? I believe I ’ ve been asked to be kind to you . As a beginning you can clean out my study this afternoon . Be awfully careful how you dust the old china . If you break any don ’ t come and tell me but just go and drown yourself somewhere ; it will save you from a worse fate. ” “ I don ’ t know where your study is , ” said Lancelot between his chokes . “ You ’ d better find it or I shall have to beat you , really hard this time . Here , you ’ d better keep this chalk in your pocket , it ’ s sure to come in handy later on . Don ’ t stop to thank me for all I ’ ve done , it only embarrasses me. ” As Comus hadn ’ t got a study Lancelot spent a feverish half-hour in looking for it , incidentally missing another footer practice . “ Everything is very jolly here , ” wrote Lancelot to his sister Emmeline . “ The prefects can give you an awful hot time if they like , but most of them are rather decent . Some are Beasts . Bassington is a prefect though only a junior one . He is the Limit as Beasts go . At least I think so. ” Schoolboy reticence went no further , but Emmeline filled in the gaps for herself with the lavish splendour of feminine imagination . Francesca ’ s bridge went crashing into the abyss . CHAPTER III ON the evening of a certain November day , two years after the events heretofore chronicled , Francesca Bassington steered her way through the crowd that filled the rooms of her friend Serena Golackly , bestowing nods of vague recognition as she went , but with eyes that were obviously intent on focussing one particular figure . Parliament had pulled its energies together for an Autumn Session , and both political Parties were fairly well represented in the throng . Serena had a harmless way of inviting a number of more or less public men and women to her house , and hoping that if you left them together long enough they would constitute a _salon_ . In pursuance of the same instinct she planted the flower borders at her week-end cottage retreat in Surrey with a large mixture of bulbs , and called the result a Dutch garden . Unfortunately , though you may bring brilliant talkers into your home , you can not always make them talk brilliantly , or even talk at all ; what is worse you can not restrict the output of those starling-voiced dullards who seem to have , on all subjects , so much to say that was well worth leaving unsaid . One group that Francesca passed was discussing a Spanish painter , who was forty-three , and had painted thousands of square yards of canvas in his time , but of whom no one in London had heard till a few months ago ; now the starling-voices seemed determined that one should hear of very little else . Three women knew how his name was pronounced , another always felt that she must go into a forest and pray whenever she saw his pictures , another had noticed that there were always pomegranates in his later compositions , and a man with an indefensible collar knew what the pomegranates “ meant. ” “ What I think so splendid about him , ” said a stout lady in a loud challenging voice , “ is the way he defies all the conventions of art while retaining all that the conventions stand for. ” “ Ah , but have you noticed— ” put in the man with the atrocious collar , and Francesca pushed desperately on , wondering dimly as she went , what people found so unsupportable in the affliction of deafness . Her progress was impeded for a moment by a couple engaged in earnest and voluble discussion of some smouldering question of the day ; a thin spectacled young man with the receding forehead that so often denotes advanced opinions , was talking to a spectacled young woman with a similar type of forehead , and exceedingly untidy hair . It was her ambition in life to be taken for a Russian girl-student , and she had spent weeks of patient research in trying to find out exactly where you put the tea-leaves in a samovar . She had once been introduced to a young Jewess from Odessa , who had died of pneumonia the following week ; the experience , slight as it was , constituted the spectacled young lady an authority on all things Russian in the eyes of her immediate set . “ Talk is helpful , talk is needful , ” the young man was saying , “ but what we have got to do is to lift the subject out of the furrow of indisciplined talk and place it on the threshing-floor of practical discussion. ” The young woman took advantage of the rhetorical full-stop to dash in with the remark which was already marshalled on the tip of her tongue . “ In emancipating the serfs of poverty we must be careful to avoid the mistakes which Russian bureaucracy stumbled into when liberating the serfs of the soil. ” She paused in her turn for the sake of declamatory effect , but recovered her breath quickly enough to start afresh on level terms with the young man , who had jumped into the stride of his next sentence . “ They got off to a good start that time , ” said Francesca to herself ; “ I suppose it ’ s the Prevention of Destitution they ’ re hammering at . What on earth would become of these dear good people if anyone started a crusade for the prevention of mediocrity ? ” Midway through one of the smaller rooms , still questing for an elusive presence , she caught sight of someone that she knew , and the shadow of a frown passed across her face . The object of her faintly signalled displeasure was Courtenay Youghal , a political spur-winner who seemed absurdly youthful to a generation that had never heard of Pitt . It was Youghal ’ s ambition—or perhaps his hobby—to infuse into the greyness of modern political life some of the colour of Disraelian dandyism , tempered with the correctness of Anglo-Saxon taste , and supplemented by the flashes of wit that were inherent from the Celtic strain in him . His success was only a half-measure . The public missed in him that touch of blatancy which it looks for in its rising public men ; the decorative smoothness of his chestnut-golden hair , and the lively sparkle of his epigrams were counted to him for good , but the restrained sumptuousness of his waistcoats and cravats were as wasted efforts . If he had habitually smoked cigarettes in a pink coral mouthpiece , or worn spats of Mackenzie tartan , the great heart of the voting-man , and the gush of the paragraph-makers might have been unreservedly his . The art of public life consists to a great extent of knowing exactly where to stop and going a bit further . It was not Youghal ’ s lack of political sagacity that had brought the momentary look of disapproval into Francesca ’ s face . The fact was that Comus , who had left off being a schoolboy and was now a social problem , had lately enrolled himself among the young politician ’ s associates and admirers , and as the boy knew and cared nothing about politics , and merely copied Youghal ’ s waistcoats , and , less successfully , his conversation , Francesca felt herself justified in deploring the intimacy . To a woman who dressed well on comparatively nothing a year it was an anxious experience to have a son who dressed sumptuously on absolutely nothing . The cloud that had passed over her face when she caught sight of the offending Youghal was presently succeeded by a smile of gratified achievement , as she encountered a bow of recognition and welcome from a portly middle-aged gentleman , who seemed genuinely anxious to include her in the rather meagre group that he had gathered about him . “ We were just talking about my new charge , ” he observed genially , including in the “ we ” his somewhat depressed-looking listeners , who in all human probability had done none of the talking . “ I was just telling them , and you may be interested to hear this— ” Francesca , with Spartan stoicism , continued to wear an ingratiating smile , though the character of the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear and will not hearken , seemed to her at that moment a beautiful one . Sir Julian Jull had been a member of a House of Commons distinguished for its high standard of well-informed mediocrity , and had harmonised so thoroughly with his surroundings that the most attentive observer of Parliamentary proceedings could scarcely have told even on which side of the House he sat . A baronetcy bestowed on him by the Party in power had at least removed that doubt ; some weeks later he had been made Governor of some West Indian dependency , whether as a reward for having accepted the baronetcy , or as an application of a theory that West Indian islands get the Governors they deserve , it would have been hard to say . To Sir Julian the appointment was , doubtless , one of some importance ; during the span of his Governorship the island might possibly be visited by a member of the Royal Family , or at the least by an earthquake , and in either case his name would get into the papers . To the public the matter was one of absolute indifference ; “ who is he and where is it ? ” would have correctly epitomised the sum total of general information on the personal and geographical aspects of the case . Francesca , however , from the moment she had heard of the likelihood of the appointment , had taken a deep and lively interest in Sir Julian . As a Member of Parliament he had not filled any very pressing social want in her life , and on the rare occasions when she took tea on the Terrace of the House she was wont to lapse into rapt contemplation of St. Thomas ’ s Hospital whenever she saw him within bowing distance . But as Governor of an island he would , of course , want a private secretary , and as a friend and colleague of Henry Greech , to whom he was indebted for many little acts of political support ( they had once jointly drafted an amendment which had been ruled out of order ) , what was more natural and proper than that he should let his choice fall on Henry ’ s nephew Comus ? While privately doubting whether the boy would make the sort of secretary that any public man would esteem as a treasure , Henry was thoroughly in agreement with Francesca as to the excellence and desirability of an arrangement which would transplant that troublesome ’ young animal from the too restricted and conspicuous area that centres in the parish of St. James ’ s to some misty corner of the British dominion overseas . Brother and sister had conspired to give an elaborate and at the same time cosy little luncheon to Sir Julian on the very day that his appointment was officially announced , and the question of the secretaryship had been mooted and sedulously fostered as occasion permitted , until all that was now needed to clinch the matter was a formal interview between His Excellency and Comus . The boy had from the first shewn very little gratification at the prospect of his deportation . To live on a remote shark-girt island , as he expressed it , with the Jull family as his chief social mainstay , and Sir Julian ’ s conversation as a daily item of his existence , did not inspire him with the same degree of enthusiasm as was displayed by his mother and uncle , who , after all , were not making the experiment . Even the necessity for an entirely new outfit did not appeal to his imagination with the force that might have been expected . But , however lukewarm his adhesion to the project might be , Francesca and her brother were clearly determined that no lack of deft persistence on their part should endanger its success . It was for the purpose of reminding Sir Julian of his promise to meet Comus at lunch on the following day , and definitely settle the matter of the secretaryship that Francesca was now enduring the ordeal of a long harangue on the value of the West Indian group as an Imperial asset . Other listeners dexterously detached themselves one by one , but Francesca ’ s patience outlasted even Sir Julian ’ s flow of commonplaces , and her devotion was duly rewarded by a renewed acknowledgment of the lunch engagement and its purpose . She pushed her way back through the throng of starling-voiced chatterers fortified by a sense of well-earned victory . Dear Serena ’ s absurd _salons_ served some good purpose after all . Francesca was not an early riser and her breakfast was only just beginning to mobilise on the breakfast-table next morning when a copy of _The Times_ , sent by special messenger from her brother ’ s house , was brought up to her room . A heavy margin of blue pencilling drew her attention to a prominently-printed letter which bore the ironical heading : “ Julian Jull , Proconsul. ” The matter of the letter was a cruel dis-interment of some fatuous and forgotten speeches made by Sir Julian to his constituents not many years ago , in which the value of some of our Colonial possessions , particularly certain West Indian islands , was decried in a medley of pomposity , ignorance and amazingly cheap humour . The extracts given sounded weak and foolish enough , taken by themselves , but the writer of the letter had interlarded them with comments of his own , which sparkled with an ironical brilliance that was Cervantes-like in its polished cruelty . Remembering her ordeal of the previous evening Francesca permitted herself a certain feeling of amusement as she read the merciless stabs inflicted on the newly-appointed Governor ; then she came to the signature at the foot of the letter , and the laughter died out of her eyes . “ Comus Bassington ” stared at her from above a thick layer of blue pencil lines marked by Henry Greech ’ s shaking hand . Comus could no more have devised such a letter than he could have written an Episcopal charge to the clergy of any given diocese . It was obviously the work of Courtenay Youghal , and Comus , for a palpable purpose of his own , had wheedled him into foregoing for once the pride of authorship in a clever piece of political raillery , and letting his young friend stand sponsor instead . It was a daring stroke , and there could be no question as to its success ; the secretaryship and the distant shark-girt island faded away into the horizon of impossible things . Francesca , forgetting the golden rule of strategy which enjoins a careful choosing of ground and opportunity before entering on hostilities , made straight for the bathroom door , behind which a lively din of splashing betokened that Comus had at least begun his toilet . “ You wicked boy , what have you done ? ” she cried , reproachfully . “ Me washee , ” came a cheerful shout ; “ me washee from the neck all the way down to the merrythought , and now washee down from the merrythought to— ” “ You have ruined your future . _The Times_ has printed that miserable letter with your signature. ” A loud squeal of joy came from the bath . “ Oh , Mummy ! Let me see ! ” There were sounds as of a sprawling dripping body clambering hastily out of the bath . Francesca fled . One can not effectively scold a moist nineteen-year old boy clad only in a bath-towel and a cloud of steam . Another messenger arrived before Francesca ’ s breakfast was over . This one brought a letter from Sir Julian Jull , excusing himself from fulfilment of the luncheon engagement . CHAPTER IV FRANCESCA prided herself on being able to see things from other people ’ s points of view , which meant , as it usually does , that she could see her own point of view from various aspects . As regards Comus , whose doings and non-doings bulked largely in her thoughts at the present moment , she had mapped out in her mind so clearly what his outlook in life ought to be , that she was peculiarly unfitted to understand the drift of his feelings or the impulses that governed them . Fate had endowed her with a son ; in limiting the endowment to a solitary offspring Fate had certainly shown a moderation which Francesca was perfectly willing to acknowledge and be thankful for ; but then , as she pointed out to a certain complacent friend of hers who cheerfully sustained an endowment of half-a-dozen male offsprings and a girl or two , her one child was Comus . Moderation in numbers was more than counterbalanced in his case by extravagance in characteristics . Francesca mentally compared her son with hundreds of other young men whom she saw around her , steadily , and no doubt happily , engaged in the process of transforming themselves from nice boys into useful citizens . Most of them had occupations , or were industriously engaged in qualifying for such ; in their leisure moments they smoked reasonably-priced cigarettes , went to the cheaper seats at music-halls , watched an occasional cricket match at Lord ’ s with apparent interest , saw most of the world ’ s spectacular events through the medium of the cinematograph , and were wont to exchange at parting seemingly superfluous injunctions to “ be good. ” The whole of Bond Street and many of the tributary thoroughfares of Piccadilly might have been swept off the face of modern London without in any way interfering with the supply of their daily wants . They were doubtless dull as acquaintances , but as sons they would have been eminently restful . With a growing sense of irritation Francesca compared these deserving young men with her own intractable offspring , and wondered why Fate should have singled her out to be the parent of such a vexatious variant from a comfortable and desirable type . As far as remunerative achievement was concerned , Comus copied the insouciance of the field lily with a dangerous fidelity . Like his mother he looked round with wistful irritation at the example afforded by contemporary youth , but he concentrated his attention exclusively on the richer circles of his acquaintance , young men who bought cars and polo ponies as unconcernedly as he might purchase a carnation for his buttonhole , and went for trips to Cairo or the Tigris valley with less difficulty and finance-stretching than he encountered in contriving a week-end at Brighton . Gaiety and good-looks had carried Comus successfully and , on the whole , pleasantly , through schooldays and a recurring succession of holidays ; the same desirable assets were still at his service to advance him along his road , but it was a disconcerting experience to find that they could not be relied on to go all distances at all times . In an animal world , and a fiercely competitive animal world at that , something more was needed than the decorative _abandon_ of the field lily , and it was just that something more which Comus seemed unable or unwilling to provide on his own account ; it was just the lack of that something more which left him sulking with Fate over the numerous breakdowns and stumbling-blocks that held him up on what he expected to be a triumphal or , at any rate , unimpeded progress . Francesca was , in her own way , fonder of Comus than of anyone else in the world , and if he had been browning his skin somewhere east of Suez she would probably have kissed his photograph with genuine fervour every night before going to bed ; the appearance of a cholera scare or rumour of native rising in the columns of her daily news-sheet would have caused her a flutter of anxiety , and she would have mentally likened herself to a Spartan mother sacrificing her best-beloved on the altar of State necessities . But with the best-beloved installed under her roof , occupying an unreasonable amount of cubic space , and demanding daily sacrifices instead of providing the raw material for one , her feelings were tinged with irritation rather than affection . She might have forgiven Comus generously for misdeeds of some gravity committed in another continent , but she could never overlook the fact that out of a dish of five plovers ’ eggs he was certain to take three . The absent may be always wrong , but they are seldom in a position to be inconsiderate . Thus a wall of ice had grown up gradually between mother and son , a barrier across which they could hold converse , but which gave a wintry chill even to the sparkle of their lightest words . The boy had the gift of being irresistibly amusing when he chose to exert himself in that direction , and after a long series of moody or jangling meal-sittings he would break forth into a torrential flow of small talk , scandal and malicious anecdote , true or more generally invented , to which Francesca listened with a relish and appreciation , that was all the more flattering from being so unwillingly bestowed . “ If you chose your friends from a rather more reputable set you would be doubtless less amusing , but there would be compensating advantages. ” Francesca snapped the remark out at lunch one day when she had been betrayed into a broader smile than she considered the circumstances of her attitude towards Comus warranted . “ I ’ m going to move in quite decent society to-night , ” replied Comus with a pleased chuckle ; “ I ’ m going to meet you and Uncle Henry and heaps of nice dull God-fearing people at dinner. ” Francesca gave a little gasp of surprise and annoyance . “ You don ’ t mean to say Caroline has asked you to dinner to-night ? ” she said ; “ and of course without telling me . How exceedingly like her ! ” Lady Caroline Benaresq had reached that age when you can say and do what you like in defiance of people ’ s most sensitive feelings and most cherished antipathies . Not that she had waited to attain her present age before pursuing that line of conduct ; she came of a family whose individual members went through life , from the nursery to the grave , with as much tact and consideration as a cactus-hedge might show in going through a crowded bathing tent . It was a compensating mercy that they disagreed rather more among themselves than they did with the outside world ; every known variety and shade of religion and politics had been pressed into the family service to avoid the possibility of any agreement on the larger essentials of life , and such unlooked-for happenings as the Home Rule schism , the Tariff-Reform upheaval and the Suffragette crusade were thankfully seized on as furnishing occasion for further differences and sub-divisions . Lady Caroline ’ s favourite scheme of entertaining was to bring jarring and antagonistic elements into close contact and play them remorselessly one against the other . “ One gets much better results under those circumstances ” she used to observe , “ than by asking people who wish to meet each other . Few people talk as brilliantly to impress a friend as they do to depress an enemy. ” She admitted that her theory broke down rather badly if you applied it to Parliamentary debates . At her own dinner table its success was usually triumphantly vindicated . “ Who else is to be there ? ” Francesca asked , with some pardonable misgiving . “ Courtenay Youghal . He ’ ll probably sit next to you , so you ’ d better think out a lot of annihilating remarks in readiness . And Elaine de Frey. ” “ I don ’ t think I ’ ve heard of her . Who is she ? ” “ Nobody in particular , but rather nice-looking in a solemn sort of way , and almost indecently rich. ” “ Marry her ” was the advice which sprang to Francesca ’ s lips , but she choked it back with a salted almond , having a rare perception of the fact that words are sometimes given to us to defeat our purposes . “ Caroline has probably marked her down for Toby or one of the grand-nephews , ” she said , carelessly ; “ a little money would be rather useful in that quarter , I imagine. ” Comus tucked in his underlip with just the shade of pugnacity that she wanted to see . An advantageous marriage was so obviously the most sensible course for him to embark on that she scarcely dared to hope that he would seriously entertain it ; yet there was just a chance that if he got as far as the flirtation stage with an attractive ( and attracted ) girl who was also an heiress , the sheer perversity of his nature might carry him on to more definite courtship , if only from the desire to thrust other more genuinely enamoured suitors into the background . It was a forlorn hope ; so forlorn that the idea even crossed her mind of throwing herself on the mercy of her _bête noire_ , Courtenay Youghal , and trying to enlist the influence which he seemed to possess over Comus for the purpose of furthering her hurriedly conceived project . Anyhow , the dinner promised to be more interesting than she had originally anticipated . Lady Caroline was a professed Socialist in politics , chiefly , it was believed , because she was thus enabled to disagree with most of the Liberals and Conservatives , and all the Socialists of the day . She did not permit her Socialism , however , to penetrate below stairs ; her cook and butler had every encouragement to be Individualists . Francesca , who was a keen and intelligent food critic , harboured no misgivings as to her hostess ’ s kitchen and cellar departments ; some of the human side-dishes at the feast gave her more ground for uneasiness . Courtenay Youghal , for instance , would probably be brilliantly silent ; her brother Henry would almost certainly be the reverse . The dinner party was a large one and Francesca arrived late with little time to take preliminary stock of the guests ; a card with the name , “ Miss de Frey , ” immediately opposite her own place at the other side of the table , indicated , however , the whereabouts of the heiress . It was characteristic of Francesca that she first carefully read the menu from end to end , and then indulged in an equally careful though less open scrutiny of the girl who sat opposite her , the girl who was nobody in particular , but whose income was everything that could be desired . She was pretty in a restrained nut-brown fashion , and had a look of grave reflective calm that probably masked a speculative unsettled temperament . Her pose , if one wished to be critical , was just a little too elaborately careless . She wore some excellently set rubies with that indefinable air of having more at home that is so difficult to improvise . Francesca was distinctly pleased with her survey . “ You seem interested in your _vis-à-vis_ , ” said Courtenay Youghal . “ I almost think I ’ ve seen her before , ” said Francesca ; “ her face seems familiar to me. ” “ The narrow gallery at the Louvre ; attributed to Leonardo da Vinci , ” said Youghal . “ Of course , ” said Francesca , her feelings divided between satisfaction at capturing an elusive impression and annoyance that Youghal should have been her helper . A stronger tinge of annoyance possessed her when she heard the voice of Henry Greech raised in painful prominence at Lady Caroline ’ s end of the table . “ I called on the Trudhams yesterday , ” he announced ; “ it was their Silver Wedding , you know , at least the day before was . Such lots of silver presents , quite a show . Of course there were a great many duplicates , but still , very nice to have . I think they were very pleased to get so many. ” “ We must not grudge them their show of presents after their twenty-five years of married life , ” said Lady Caroline , gently ; “ it is the silver lining to their cloud. ” A third of the guests present were related to the Trudhams . “ Lady Caroline is beginning well , ” murmured Courtenay Youghal . “ I should hardly call twenty-five years of married life a cloud , ” said Henry Greech , lamely . “ Don ’ t let ’ s talk about married life , ” said a tall handsome woman , who looked like some modern painter ’ s conception of the goddess Bellona ; “ it ’ s my misfortune to write eternally about husbands and wives and their variants . My public expects it of me . I do so envy journalists who can write about plagues and strikes and Anarchist plots , and other pleasing things , instead of being tied down to one stale old topic. ” “ Who is that woman and what has she written ? ” Francesca asked Youghal ; she dimly remembered having seen her at one of Serena Golackly ’ s gatherings , surrounded by a little Court of admirers . “ I forget her name ; she has a villa at San Remo or Mentone , or somewhere where one does have villas , and plays an extraordinary good game of bridge . Also she has the reputation , rather rare in your sex , of being a wonderfully sound judge of wine. ” “ But what has she written ? ” “ Oh , several novels of the thinnish ice order . Her last one , ‘ The Woman who wished it was Wednesday , ’ has been banned at all the libraries . I expect you ’ ve read it. ” “ I don ’ t see why you should think so , ” said Francesca , coldly . “ Only because Comus lent me your copy yesterday , ” said Youghal . He threw back his handsome head and gave her a sidelong glance of quizzical amusement . He knew that she hated his intimacy with Comus , and he was secretly rather proud of his influence over the boy , shallow and negative though he knew it to be . It had been , on his part , an unsought intimacy , and it would probably fall to pieces the moment he tried seriously to take up the _rôle_ of mentor . The fact that Comus ’ s mother openly disapproved of the friendship gave it perhaps its chief interest in the young politician ’ s eyes . Francesca turned her attention to her brother ’ s end of the table . Henry Greech had willingly availed himself of the invitation to leave the subject of married life , and had launched forthwith into the equally well-worn theme of current politics . He was not a person who was in much demand for public meetings , and the House showed no great impatience to hear his views on the topics of the moment ; its impatience , indeed , was manifested rather in the opposite direction . Hence he was prone to unburden himself of accumulated political wisdom as occasion presented itself—sometimes , indeed , to assume an occasion that was hardly visible to the naked intelligence . “ Our opponents are engaged in a hopelessly uphill struggle , and they know it , ” he chirruped , defiantly ; “ they ’ ve become possessed , like the Gadarene swine , with a whole legion of— ” “ Surely the Gadarene swine went downhill , ” put in Lady Caroline in a gently enquiring voice . Henry Greech hastily abandoned simile and fell back on platitude and the safer kinds of fact . Francesca did not regard her brother ’ s views on statecraft either in the light of gospel or revelation ; as Comus once remarked , they more usually suggested exodus . In the present instance she found distraction in a renewed scrutiny of the girl opposite her , who seemed to be only moderately interested in the conversational efforts of the diners on either side of her . Comus who was looking and talking his best , was sitting at the further end of the table , and Francesca was quick to notice in which direction the girl ’ s glances were continually straying . Once or twice the eyes of the young people met and a swift flush of pleasure and a half-smile that spoke of good understanding came to the heiress ’ s face . It did not need the gift of the traditional intuition of her sex to enable Francesca to guess that the girl with the desirable banking account was already considerably attracted by the lively young Pagan who had , when he cared to practise it , such an art of winning admiration . For the first time for many , many months Francesca saw her son ’ s prospects in a rose-coloured setting , and she began , unconsciously , to wonder exactly how much wealth was summed up in the expressive label “ almost indecently rich. ” A wife with a really large fortune and a correspondingly big dower of character and ambition , might , perhaps , succeed in turning Comus ’ s latent energies into a groove which would provide him , if not with a career , at least with an occupation , and the young serious face opposite looked as if its owner lacked neither character or ambition . Francesca ’ s speculations took a more personal turn . Out of the well-filled coffers with which her imagination was toying , an inconsiderable sum might eventually be devoted to the leasing , or even perhaps the purchase of , the house in Blue Street when the present convenient arrangement should have come to an end , and Francesca and the Van der Meulen would not be obliged to seek fresh quarters . A woman ’ s voice , talking in a discreet undertone on the other side of Courtenay Youghal , broke in on her bridge-building . “ Tons of money and really very presentable . Just the wife for a rising young politician . Go in and win her before she ’ s snapped up by some fortune hunter. ” Youghal and his instructress in worldly wisdom were looking straight across the table at the Leonardo da Vinci girl with the grave reflective eyes and the over-emphasised air of repose . Francesca felt a quick throb of anger against her match-making neighbour ; why , she asked herself , must some women , with no end or purpose of their own to serve , except the sheer love of meddling in the affairs of others , plunge their hands into plots and schemings of this sort , in which the happiness of more than one person was concerned ? And more clearly than ever she realised how thoroughly she detested Courtenay Youghal . She had disliked him as an evil influence , setting before her son an example of showy ambition that he was not in the least likely to follow , and providing him with a model of extravagant dandyism that he was only too certain to copy . In her heart she knew that Comus would have embarked just as surely on his present course of idle self-indulgence if he had never known of the existence of Youghal , but she chose to regard that young man as her son ’ s evil genius , and now he seemed likely to justify more than ever the character she had fastened on to him . For once in his life Comus appeared to have an idea of behaving sensibly and making some use of his opportunities , and almost at the same moment Courtenay Youghal arrived on the scene as a possible and very dangerous rival . Against the good looks and fitful powers of fascination that Comus could bring into the field , the young politician could match half-a-dozen dazzling qualities which would go far to recommend him in the eyes of a woman of the world , still more in those of a young girl in search of an ideal . Good-looking in his own way , if not on such showy lines as Comus , always well turned-out , witty , self-confident without being bumptious , with a conspicuous Parliamentary career alongside him , and heaven knew what else in front of him , Courtenay Youghal certainly was not a rival whose chances could be held very lightly . Francesca laughed bitterly to herself as she remembered that a few hours ago she had entertained the idea of begging for his good offices in helping on Comus ’ s wooing . One consolation , at least , she found for herself : if Youghal really meant to step in and try and cut out his young friend , the latter at any rate had snatched a useful start . Comus had mentioned Miss de Frey at luncheon that day , casually and dispassionately ; if the subject of the dinner guests had not come up he would probably not have mentioned her at all . But they were obviously already very good friends . It was part and parcel of the state of domestic tension at Blue Street that Francesca should only have come to know of this highly interesting heiress by an accidental sorting of guests at a dinner party . Lady Caroline ’ s voice broke in on her reflections ; it was a gentle purring voice , that possessed an uncanny quality of being able to make itself heard down the longest dinner table . “ The dear Archdeacon is getting so absent-minded . He read a list of box-holders for the opera as the First Lesson the other Sunday , instead of the families and lots of the tribes of Israel that entered Canaan . Fortunately no one noticed the mistake. ” CHAPTER V ON a conveniently secluded bench facing the Northern Pheasantry in the Zoological Society ’ s Gardens , Regent ’ s Park , Courtenay Youghal sat immersed in mature flirtation with a lady , who , though certainly young in fact and appearance , was some four or five years his senior . When he was a schoolboy of sixteen , Molly McQuade had personally conducted him to the Zoo and stood him dinner afterwards at Kettner ’ s , and whenever the two of them happened to be in town on the anniversary of that bygone festivity they religiously repeated the programme in its entirety . Even the menu of the dinner was adhered to as nearly as possible ; the original selection of food and wine that schoolboy exuberance , tempered by schoolboy shyness , had pitched on those many years ago , confronted Youghal on those occasions , as a drowning man ’ s past life is said to rise up and parade itself in his last moments of consciousness . The flirtation which was thus perennially restored to its old-time footing owed its longevity more to the enterprising solicitude of Miss McQuade than to any conscious sentimental effort on the part of Youghal himself . Molly McQuade was known to her neighbours in a minor hunting shire as a hard-riding conventionally unconventional type of young woman , who came naturally into the classification , “ a good sort. ” She was just sufficiently good-looking , sufficiently reticent about her own illnesses , when she had any , and sufficiently appreciative of her neighbours ’ gardens , children and hunters to be generally popular . Most men liked her , and the percentage of women who disliked her was not inconveniently high . One of these days , it was assumed , she would marry a brewer or a Master of Otter Hounds , and , after a brief interval , be known to the world as the mother of a boy or two at Malvern or some similar seat of learning . The romantic side of her nature was altogether unguessed by the countryside . Her romances were mostly in serial form and suffered perhaps in fervour from their disconnected course what they gained in length of days . Her affectionate interest in the several young men who figured in her affairs of the heart was perfectly honest , and she certainly made no attempt either to conceal their separate existences , or to play them off one against the other . Neither could it be said that she was a husband hunter ; she had made up her mind what sort of man she was likely to marry , and her forecast did not differ very widely from that formed by her local acquaintances . If her married life were eventually to turn out a failure , at least she looked forward to it with very moderate expectations . Her love affairs she put on a very different footing and apparently they were the all-absorbing element in her life . She possessed the happily constituted temperament which enables a man or woman to be a “ pluralist , ” and to observe the sage precaution of not putting all one ’ s eggs into one basket . Her demands were not exacting ; she required of her affinity that he should be young , good-looking , and at least , moderately amusing ; she would have preferred him to be invariably faithful , but , with her own example before her , she was prepared for the probability , bordering on certainty , that he would be nothing of the sort . The philosophy of the “ Garden of Kama ” was the compass by which she steered her barque and thus far , if she had encountered some storms and buffeting , she had at least escaped being either shipwrecked or becalmed . Courtenay Youghal had not been designed by Nature to fulfil the _rôle_ of an ardent or devoted lover , and he scrupulously respected the limits which Nature had laid down . For Molly , however , he had a certain responsive affection . She had always obviously admired him , and at the same time she never beset him with crude flattery ; the principal reason why the flirtation had stood the test of so many years was the fact that it only flared into active existence at convenient intervals . In an age when the telephone has undermined almost every fastness of human privacy , and the sanctity of one ’ s seclusion depends often on the ability for tactful falsehood shown by a club pageboy , Youghal was duly appreciative of the circumstance that his lady fair spent a large part of the year pursuing foxes , in lieu of pursuing him . Also the honestly admitted fact that , in her human hunting , she rode after more than one quarry , made the inevitable break-up of the affair a matter to which both could look forward without a sense of coming embarrassment and recrimination . When the time for gathering ye rosebuds should be over , neither of them could accuse the other of having wrecked his or her entire life . At the most they would only have disorganised a week-end . On this particular afternoon , when old reminiscences had been gone through , and the intervening gossip of past months duly recounted , a lull in the conversation made itself rather obstinately felt . Molly had already guessed that matters were about to slip into a new phase ; the affair had reached maturity long ago , and a new phase must be in the nature of a wane . “ You ’ re a clever brute , ” she said , suddenly , with an air of affectionate regret ; “ I always knew you ’ d get on in the House , but I hardly expected you to come to the front so soon. ” “ I ’ m coming to the front , ” admitted Youghal , judicially ; “ the problem is , shall I be able to stay there . Unless something happens in the financial line before long , I don ’ t see how I ’ m to stay in Parliament at all . Economy is out of the question . It would open people ’ s eyes , I fancy , if they knew how little I exist on as it is . And I ’ m living so far beyond my income that we may almost be said to be living apart. ” “ It will have to be a rich wife , I suppose , ” said Molly , slowly ; “ that ’ s the worst of success , it imposes so many conditions . I rather knew , from something in your manner , that you were drifting that way. ” Youghal said nothing in the way of contradiction ; he gazed steadfastly at the aviary in front of him as though exotic pheasants were for the moment the most absorbing study in the world . As a matter of fact , his mind was centred on the image of Elaine de Frey , with her clear untroubled eyes and her Leonardo da Vinci air . He was wondering whether he was likely to fall into a frame of mind concerning her which would be in the least like falling in love . “ I shall mind horribly , ” continued Molly , after a pause , “ but , of course , I have always known that something of the sort would have to happen one of these days . When a man goes into politics he can ’ t call his soul his own , and I suppose his heart becomes an impersonal possession in the same way. ” “ Most people who know me would tell you that I haven ’ t got a heart , ” said Youghal . “ I ’ ve often felt inclined to agree with them , ” said Molly ; “ and then , now and again , I think you have a heart tucked away somewhere. ” “ I hope I have , ” said Youghal , “ because I ’ m trying to break to you the fact that I think I ’ m falling in love with somebody. ” Molly McQuade turned sharply to look at her companion , who still fixed his gaze on the pheasant run in front of him . “ Don ’ t tell me you ’ re losing your head over somebody useless , someone without money , ” she said ; “ I don ’ t think I could stand that. ” For the moment she feared that Courtenay ’ s selfishness might have taken an unexpected turn , in which ambition had given way to the fancy of the hour ; he might be going to sacrifice his Parliamentary career for a life of stupid lounging in momentarily attractive company . He quickly undeceived her . “ She ’ s got heaps of money. ” Molly gave a grunt of relief . Her affection for Courtenay had produced the anxiety which underlay her first question ; a natural jealousy prompted the next one . “ Is she young and pretty and all that sort of thing , or is she just a good sort with a sympathetic manner and nice eyes ? As a rule that ’ s the kind that goes with a lot of money. ” “ Young and quite good-looking in her way , and a distinct style of her own . Some people would call her beautiful . As a political hostess I should think she ’ d be splendid . I imagine I ’ m rather in love with her. ” “ And is she in love with you ? ” Youghal threw back his head with the slight assertive movement that Molly knew and liked . “ She ’ s a girl who I fancy would let judgment influence her a lot . And without being stupidly conceited , I think I may say she might do worse than throw herself away on me . I ’ m young and quite good-looking , and I ’ m making a name for myself in the House ; she ’ ll be able to read all sorts of nice and horrid things about me in the papers at breakfast-time . I can be brilliantly amusing at times , and I understand the value of silence ; there is no fear that I shall ever degenerate into that fearsome thing—a cheerful talkative husband . For a girl with money and social ambitions I should think I was rather a good thing. ” “ You are certainly in love , Courtenay , ” said Molly , “ but it ’ s the old love and not a new one . I ’ m rather glad . I should have hated to have you head-over-heels in love with a pretty woman , even for a short time . You ’ ll be much happier as it is . And I ’ m going to put all my feelings in the background , and tell you to go in and win . You ’ ve got to marry a rich woman , and if she ’ s nice and will make a good hostess , so much the better for everybody . You ’ ll be happier in your married life than I shall be in mine , when it comes ; you ’ ll have other interests to absorb you . I shall just have the garden and dairy and nursery and lending library , as like as two peas to all the gardens and dairies and nurseries for hundreds of miles round . You won ’ t care for your wife enough to be worried every time she has a finger-ache , and you ’ ll like her well enough to be pleased to meet her sometimes at your own house . I shouldn ’ t wonder if you were quite happy . She will probably be miserable , but any woman who married you would be. ” There was a short pause ; they were both staring at the pheasant cages . Then Molly spoke again , with the swift nervous tone of a general who is hurriedly altering the disposition of his forces for a strategic retreat . “ When you are safely married and honey-mooned and all that sort of thing , and have put your wife through her paces as a political hostess , some time , when the House isn ’ t sitting , you must come down by yourself , and do a little hunting with us . Will you ? It won ’ t be quite the same as old times , but it will be something to look forward to when I ’ m reading the endless paragraphs about your fashionable political wedding. ” “ You ’ re looking forward pretty far , ” laughed Youghal ; “ the lady may take your view as to the probable unhappiness of a future shared with me , and I may have to content myself with penurious political bachelorhood . Anyhow , the present is still with us . We dine at Kettner ’ s to-night , don ’ t we ? ” “ Rather , ” said Molly , “ though it will be more or less a throat-lumpy feast as far as I am concerned . We shall have to drink to the health of the future Mrs. Youghal . By the way , it ’ s rather characteristic of you that you haven ’ t told me who she is , and of me that I haven ’ t asked . And now , like a dear boy , trot away and leave me . I haven ’ t got to say good-bye to you yet , but I ’ m going to take a quiet farewell of the Pheasantry . We ’ ve had some jolly good talks , you and I , sitting on this seat , haven ’ t we ? And I know , as well as I know anything , that this is the last of them . Eight o ’ clock to-night , as punctually as possible. ” She watched his retreating figure with eyes that grew slowly misty ; he had been such a jolly comely boy-friend , and they had had such good times together . The mist deepened on her lashes as she looked round at the familiar rendezvous where they had so often kept tryst since the day when they had first come there together , he a schoolboy and she but lately out of her teens . For the moment she felt herself in the thrall of a very real sorrow . Then , with the admirable energy of one who is only in town for a fleeting fortnight , she raced away to have tea with a world-faring naval admirer at his club . Pluralism is a merciful narcotic . CHAPTER VI ELAINE DE FREY sat at ease—at bodily ease—at any rate—in a low wicker chair placed under the shade of a group of cedars in the heart of a stately spacious garden that had almost made up its mind to be a park . The shallow stone basin of an old fountain , on whose wide ledge a leaden-moulded otter for ever preyed on a leaden salmon , filled a conspicuous place in the immediate foreground . Around its rim ran an inscription in Latin , warning mortal man that time flows as swiftly as water and exhorting him to make the most of his hours ; after which piece of Jacobean moralising it set itself shamelessly to beguile all who might pass that way into an abandonment of contemplative repose . On all sides of it a stretch of smooth turf spread away , broken up here and there by groups of dwarfish chestnut and mulberry trees , whose leaves and branches cast a laced pattern of shade beneath them . On one side the lawn sloped gently down to a small lake , whereon floated a quartette of swans , their movements suggestive of a certain mournful listlessness , as though a weary dignity of caste held them back from the joyous bustling life of the lesser waterfowl . Elaine liked to imagine that they re-embodied the souls of unhappy boys who had been forced by family interests to become high ecclesiastical dignitaries and had grown prematurely Right Reverend . A low stone balustrade fenced part of the shore of the lake , making a miniature terrace above its level , and here roses grew in a rich multitude . Other rose bushes , carefully pruned and tended , formed little oases of colour and perfume amid the restful green of the sward , and in the distance the eye caught the variegated blaze of a many-hued hedge of rhododendron . With these favoured exceptions flowers were hard to find in this well-ordered garden ; the misguided tyranny of staring geranium beds and beflowered archways leading to nowhere , so dear to the suburban gardener , found no expression here . Magnificent Amherst pheasants , whose plumage challenged and almost shamed the peacock on his own ground , stepped to and fro over the emerald turf with the assured self-conscious pride of reigning sultans . It was a garden where summer seemed a part-proprietor rather than a hurried visitor . By the side of Elaine ’ s chair under the shadow of the cedars a wicker table was set out with the paraphernalia of afternoon tea . On some cushions at her feet reclined Courtenay Youghal , smoothly preened and youthfully elegant , the personification of decorative repose ; equally decorative , but with the showy restlessness of a dragonfly , Comus disported his flannelled person over a considerable span of the available foreground . The intimacy existing between the two young men had suffered no immediate dislocation from the circumstance that they were tacitly paying court to the same lady . It was an intimacy founded not in the least on friendship or community of tastes and ideas , but owed its existence to the fact that each was amused and interested by the other . Youghal found Comus , for the time being at any rate , just as amusing and interesting as a rival for Elaine ’ s favour as he had been in the _rôle_ of scapegrace boy-about-Town ; Comus for his part did not wish to lose touch with Youghal , who among other attractions possessed the recommendation of being under the ban of Comus ’ s mother . She disapproved , it is true , of a great many of her son ’ s friends and associates , but this particular one was a special and persistent source of irritation to her from the fact that he figured prominently and more or less successfully in the public life of the day . There was something peculiarly exasperating in reading a brilliant and incisive attack on the Government ’ s rash handling of public expenditure delivered by a young man who encouraged her son in every imaginable extravagance . The actual extent of Youghal ’ s influence over the boy was of the slightest ; Comus was quite capable of deriving encouragement to rash outlay and frivolous conversation from an anchorite or an East-end parson if he had been thrown into close companionship with such an individual . Francesca , however , exercised a mother ’ s privilege in assuming her son ’ s bachelor associates to be industrious in labouring to achieve his undoing . Therefore the young politician was a source of unconcealed annoyance to her , and in the same degree as she expressed her disapproval of him Comus was careful to maintain and parade the intimacy . Its existence , or rather its continued existence , was one of the things that faintly puzzled the young lady whose sought-for favour might have been expected to furnish an occasion for its rapid dissolution . With two suitors , one of whom at least she found markedly attractive , courting her at the same moment , Elaine should have had reasonable cause for being on good terms with the world , and with herself in particular . Happiness was not , however , at this auspicious moment , her dominant mood . The grave calm of her face masked as usual a certain degree of grave perturbation . A succession of well-meaning governesses and a plentiful supply of moralising aunts on both sides of her family , had impressed on her young mind the theoretical fact that wealth is a great responsibility . The consciousness of her responsibility set her continually wondering , not as to her own fitness to discharge her “ stewardship , ” but as to the motives and merits of people with whom she came in contact . The knowledge that there was so much in the world that she could buy , invited speculation as to how much there was that was worth buying . Gradually she had come to regard her mind as a sort of appeal court before whose secret sittings were examined and judged the motives and actions , the motives especially , of the world in general . In her schoolroom days she had sat in conscientious judgment on the motives that guided or misguided Charles and Cromwell and Monck , Wallenstein and Savonarola . In her present stage she was equally occupied in examining the political sincerity of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs , the good-faith of a honey-tongued but possibly loyal-hearted waiting-maid , and the disinterestedness of a whole circle of indulgent and flattering acquaintances . Even more absorbing , and in her eyes , more urgently necessary , was the task of dissecting and appraising the characters of the two young men who were favouring her with their attentions . And herein lay cause for much thinking and some perturbation . Youghal , for example , might have baffled a more experienced observer of human nature . Elaine was too clever to confound his dandyism with foppishness or self-advertisement . He admired his own toilet effect in a mirror from a genuine sense of pleasure in a thing good to look upon , just as he would feel a sensuous appreciation of the sight of a well-bred , well-matched , well-turned-out pair of horses . Behind his careful political flippancy and cynicism one might also detect a certain careless sincerity , which would probably in the long run save him from moderate success , and turn him into one of the brilliant failures of his day . Beyond this it was difficult to form an exact appreciation of Courtenay Youghal , and Elaine , who liked to have her impressions distinctly labelled and pigeon-holed , was perpetually scrutinising the outer surface of his characteristics and utterances , like a baffled art critic vainly searching beneath the varnish and scratches of a doubtfully assigned picture for an enlightening signature . The young man added to her perplexities by his deliberate policy of never trying to show himself in a favourable light even when most anxious to impart a favourable impression . He preferred that people should hunt for his good qualities , and merely took very good care that as far as possible they should never draw blank ; even in the matter of selfishness , which was the anchor-sheet of his existence , he contrived to be noted , and justly noted , for doing remarkably unselfish things . As a ruler he would have been reasonably popular ; as a husband he would probably be unendurable . Comus was to a certain extent as great a mystification as Youghal , but here Elaine was herself responsible for some of the perplexity which enshrouded his character in her eyes . She had taken more than a passing fancy for the boy—for the boy as he might be , that was to say—and she was desperately unwilling to see him and appraise him as he really was . Thus the mental court of appeal was constantly engaged in examining witnesses as to character , most of whom signally failed to give any testimony which would support the favourable judgment which the tribunal was so anxious to arrive at . A woman with wider experience of the world ’ s ways and shortcomings would probably have contented herself with an endeavour to find out whether her liking for the boy outweighed her dislike of his characteristics ; Elaine took her judgments too seriously to approach the matter from such a simple and convenient standpoint . The fact that she was much more than half in love with Comus made it dreadfully important that she should discover him to have a lovable soul , and Comus , it must be confessed , did little to help forward the discovery . “ At any rate he is honest , ” she would observe to herself , after some outspoken admission of unprincipled conduct on his part , and then she would ruefully recall certain episodes in which he had figured , from which honesty had been conspicuously absent . What she tried to label honesty in his candour was probably only a cynical defiance of the laws of right and wrong . “ You look more than usually thoughtful this afternoon , ” said Comus to her , “ as if you had invented this summer day and were trying to think out improvements. ” “ If I had the power to create improvements anywhere I think I should begin with you , ” retorted Elaine . “ I ’ m sure it ’ s much better to leave me as I am , ” protested Comus ; “ you ’ re like a relative of mine up in Argyllshire , who spends his time producing improved breeds of sheep and pigs and chickens . So patronising and irritating to the Almighty I should think , to go about putting superior finishing touches to Creation. ” Elaine frowned , and then laughed , and finally gave a little sigh . “ It ’ s not easy to talk sense to you , ” she said . “ Whatever else you take in hand , ” said Youghal , “ you must never improve this garden . It ’ s what our idea of Heaven might be like if the Jews hadn ’ t invented one for us on totally different lines . It ’ s dreadful that we should accept them as the impresarios of our religious dreamland instead of the Greeks. ” “ You are not very fond of the Jews , ” said Elaine . “ I ’ ve travelled and lived a good deal in Eastern Europe , ” said Youghal . “ It seems largely a question of geography , ” said Elaine ; “ in England no one really is anti-Semitic. ” Youghal shook his head . “ I know a great many Jews who are. ” Servants had quietly , almost reverently , placed tea and its accessories on the wicker table , and quietly receded from the landscape . Elaine sat like a grave young goddess about to dispense some mysterious potion to her devotees . Her mind was still sitting in judgment on the Jewish question . Comus scrambled to his feet . “ It ’ s too hot for tea , ” he said ; “ I shall go and feed the swans. ” And he walked off with a little silver basket-dish containing brown bread-and-butter . Elaine laughed quietly . “ It ’ s so like Comus , ” she said , “ to go off with our one dish of bread-and-butter. ” Youghal chuckled responsively . It was an undoubted opportunity for him to put in some disparaging criticism of Comus , and Elaine sat alert in readiness to judge the critic and reserve judgment on the criticised . “ His selfishness is splendid but absolutely futile , ” said Youghal ; “ now my selfishness is commonplace , but always thoroughly practical and calculated . He will have great difficulty in getting the swans to accept his offering , and he incurs the odium of reducing us to a bread-and-butterless condition . Incidentally he will get very hot. ” Elaine again had the sense of being thoroughly baffled . If Youghal had said anything unkind it was about himself . “ If my cousin Suzette had been here , ” she observed , with the shadow of a malicious smile on her lips , “ I believe she would have gone into a flood of tears at the loss of her bread-and-butter , and Comus would have figured ever after in her mind as something black and destroying and hateful . In fact I don ’ t really know why we took our loss so unprotestingly. ” “ For two reasons , ” said Youghal ; “ you are rather fond of Comus . And I—am not very fond of bread-and-butter. ” The jesting remark brought a throb of pleasure to Elaine ’ s heart . She had known full well that she cared for Comus , but now that Courtenay Youghal had openly proclaimed the fact as something unchallenged and understood matters seemed placed at once on a more advanced footing . The warm sunlit garden grew suddenly into a Heaven that held the secret of eternal happiness . Youth and comeliness would always walk here , under the low-boughed mulberry trees , as unchanging as the leaden otter that for ever preyed on the leaden salmon on the edge of the old fountain , and somehow the lovers would always wear the aspect of herself and the boy who was talking to the four white swans by the water steps . Youghal was right ; this was the real Heaven of one ’ s dreams and longings , immeasurably removed from that Rue de la Paix Paradise about which one professed utterly insincere hankerings in places of public worship . Elaine drank her tea in a happy silence ; besides being a brilliant talker Youghal understood the rarer art of being a non-talker on occasion . Comus came back across the grass swinging the empty basket-dish in his hand . “ Swans were very pleased , ” he cried , gaily , “ and said they hoped I would keep the bread-and-butter dish as a souvenir of a happy tea-party . I may really have it , mayn ’ t I ? ” he continued in an anxious voice ; “ it will do to keep studs and things in . You don ’ t want it. ” “ It ’ s got the family crest on it , ” said Elaine . Some of the happiness had died out of her eyes . “ I ’ ll have that scratched off and my own put on , ” said Comus . “ It ’ s been in the family for generations , ” protested Elaine , who did not share Comus ’ s view that because you were rich your lesser possessions could have no value in your eyes . “ I want it dreadfully , ” said Comus , sulkily , “ and you ’ ve heaps of other things to put bread-and-butter in. ” For the moment he was possessed by an overmastering desire to keep the dish at all costs ; a look of greedy determination dominated his face , and he had not for an instant relaxed his grip of the coveted object . Elaine was genuinely angry by this time , and was busily telling herself that it was absurd to be put out over such a trifle ; at the same moment a sense of justice was telling her that Comus was displaying a good deal of rather shabby selfishness . And somehow her chief anxiety at the moment was to keep Courtenay Youghal from seeing that she was angry . “ I know you don ’ t really want it , so I ’ m going to keep it , ” persisted Comus . “ It ’ s too hot to argue , ” said Elaine . “ Happy mistress of your destinies , ” laughed Youghal ; “ you can suit your disputations to the desired time and temperature . I have to go and argue , or what is worse , listen to other people ’ s arguments , in a hot and doctored atmosphere suitable to an invalid lizard. ” “ You haven ’ t got to argue about a bread-and-butter dish , ” said Elaine . “ Chiefly about bread-and-butter , ” said Youghal ; “ our great preoccupation is other people ’ s bread-and-butter . They earn or produce the material , but we busy ourselves with making rules how it shall be cut up , and the size of the slices , and how much butter shall go on how much bread . That is what is called legislation . If we could only make rules as to how the bread-and-butter should be digested we should be quite happy. ” Elaine had been brought up to regard Parliaments as something to be treated with cheerful solemnity , like illness or family re-unions . Youghal ’ s flippant disparagement of the career in which he was involved did not , however , jar on her susceptibilities . She knew him to be not only a lively and effective debater but an industrious worker on committees . If he made light of his labours , at least he afforded no one else a loophole for doing so . And certainly , the Parliamentary atmosphere was not inviting on this hot afternoon . “ When must you go ? ” she asked , sympathetically . Youghal looked ruefully at his watch . Before he could answer , a cheerful hoot came through the air , as of an owl joyously challenging the sunlight with a foreboding of the coming night . He sprang laughing to his feet . “ Listen ! My summons back to my galley , ” he cried . “ The Gods have given me an hour in this enchanted garden , so I must not complain. ” Then in a lower voice he almost whispered , “ It ’ s the Persian debate to-night. ” It was the one hint he had given in the midst of his talking and laughing that he was really keenly enthralled in the work that lay before him . It was the one little intimate touch that gave Elaine the knowledge that he cared for her opinion of his work . Comus , who had emptied his cigarette-case , became suddenly clamorous at the prospect of being temporarily stranded without a smoke . Youghal took the last remaining cigarette from his own case and gravely bisected it . “ Friendship could go no further , ” he observed , as he gave one-half to the doubtfully appeased Comus , and lit the other himself . “ There are heaps more in the hall , ” said Elaine . “ It was only done for the Saint Martin of Tours effect , ” said Youghal ; “ I hate smoking when I ’ m rushing through the air . Good-bye. ” The departing galley-slave stepped forth into the sunlight , radiant and confident . A few minutes later Elaine could see glimpses of his white car as it rushed past the rhododendron bushes . He woos best who leaves first , particularly if he goes forth to battle or the semblance of battle . Somehow Elaine ’ s garden of Eternal Youth had already become clouded in its imagery . The girl-figure who walked in it was still distinctly and unchangingly herself , but her companion was more blurred and undefined , as a picture that has been superimposed on another . Youghal sped townward well satisfied with himself . To-morrow , he reflected , Elaine would read his speech in her morning paper , and he knew in advance that it was not going to be one of his worst efforts . He knew almost exactly where the punctuations of laughter and applause would burst in , he knew that nimble fingers in the Press Gallery would be taking down each gibe and argument as he flung it at the impassive Minister confronting him , and that the fair lady of his desire would be able to judge what manner of young man this was who spent his afternoon in her garden , lazily chaffing himself and his world . And he further reflected , with an amused chuckle , that she would be vividly reminded of Comus for days to come , when she took her afternoon tea , and saw the bread-and-butter reposing in an unaccustomed dish . CHAPTER VII TOWARDS four o ’ clock on a hot afternoon Francesca stepped out from a shop entrance near the Piccadilly end of Bond Street and ran almost into the arms of Merla Blathlington . The afternoon seemed to get instantly hotter . Merla was one of those human flies that buzz ; in crowded streets , at bazaars and in warm weather , she attained to the proportions of a human bluebottle . Lady Caroline Benaresq had openly predicted that a special fly-paper was being reserved for her accommodation in another world ; others , however , held the opinion that she would be miraculously multiplied in a future state , and that four or more Merla Blathlingtons , according to deserts , would be in perpetual and unremitting attendance on each lost soul . “ Here we are , ” she cried , with a glad eager buzz , “ popping in and out of shops like rabbits ; not that rabbits do pop in and out of shops very extensively. ” It was evidently one of her bluebottle days . “ Don ’ t you love Bond Street ? ” she gabbled on . “ There ’ s something so unusual and distinctive about it ; no other street anywhere else is quite like it . Don ’ t you know those ikons and images and things scattered up and down Europe , that are supposed to have been painted or carved , as the case may be , by St. Luke or Zaccheus , or somebody of that sort ; I always like to think that some notable person of those times designed Bond Street . St. Paul , perhaps . He travelled about a lot. ” “ Not in Middlesex , though , ” said Francesca . “ One can ’ t be sure , ” persisted Merla ; “ when one wanders about as much as he did one gets mixed up and forgets where one _has_ been . I can never remember whether I ’ ve been to the Tyrol twice and St. Moritz once , or the other way about ; I always have to ask my maid . And there ’ s something about the name Bond that suggests St. Paul ; didn ’ t he write a lot about the bond and the free ? ” “ I fancy he wrote in Hebrew or Greek , ” objected Francesca ; “ the word wouldn ’ t have the least resemblance. ” “ So dreadfully non-committal to go about pamphleteering in those bizarre languages , ” complained Merla ; “ that ’ s what makes all those people so elusive . As soon as you try to pin them down to a definite statement about anything you ’ re told that some vitally important word has fifteen other meanings in the original . I wonder our Cabinet Ministers and politicians don ’ t adopt a sort of dog-Latin or Esperanto jargon to deliver their speeches in ; what a lot of subsequent explaining away would be saved . But to go back to Bond Street—not that we ’ ve left it— ” “ I ’ m afraid I must leave it now , ” said Francesca , preparing to turn up Grafton Street ; “ Good-bye. ” “ Must you be going ? Come and have tea somewhere . I know of a cosy little place where one can talk undisturbed. ” Francesca repressed a shudder and pleaded an urgent engagement . “ I know where you ’ re going , ” said Merla , with the resentful buzz of a bluebottle that finds itself thwarted by the cold unreasoning resistance of a windowpane . “ You ’ re going to play bridge at Serena Golackly ’ s . She never asks me to her bridge parties. ” Francesca shuddered openly this time ; the prospect of having to play bridge anywhere in the near neighbourhood of Merla ’ s voice was not one that could be contemplated with ordinary calmness . “ Good-bye , ” she said again firmly , and passed out of earshot ; it was rather like leaving the machinery section of an exhibition . Merla ’ s diagnosis of her destination had been a correct one ; Francesca made her way slowly through the hot streets in the direction of Serena Golackly ’ s house on the far side of Berkeley Square . To the blessed certainty of finding a game of bridge , she hopefully added the possibility of hearing some fragments of news which might prove interesting and enlightening . And of enlightenment on a particular subject , in which she was acutely and personally interested , she stood in some need . Comus of late had been provokingly reticent as to his movements and doings ; partly , perhaps , because it was his nature to be provoking , partly because the daily bickerings over money matters were gradually choking other forms of conversation . Francesca had seen him once or twice in the Park in the desirable company of Elaine de Frey , and from time to time she heard of the young people as having danced together at various houses ; on the other hand , she had seen and heard quite as much evidence to connect the heiress ’ s name with that of Courtenay Youghal . Beyond this meagre and conflicting and altogether tantalising information , her knowledge of the present position of affairs did not go . If either of the young men was seriously “ making the running , ” it was probable that she would hear some sly hint or open comment about it from one of Serena ’ s gossip-laden friends , without having to go out of her way to introduce the subject and unduly disclose her own state of ignorance . And a game of bridge , played for moderately high points , gave ample excuse for convenient lapses into reticence ; if questions took an embarrassingly inquisitive turn , one could always find refuge in a defensive spade . The afternoon was too warm to make bridge a generally popular diversion , and Serena ’ s party was a comparatively small one . Only one table was incomplete when Francesca made her appearance on the scene ; at it was seated Serena herself , confronted by Ada Spelvexit , whom everyone was wont to explain as “ one of the Cheshire Spelvexits , ” as though any other variety would have been intolerable . Ada Spelvexit was one of those naturally stagnant souls who take infinite pleasure in what are called “ movements. ” “ Most of the really great lessons I have learned have been taught me by the Poor , ” was one of her favourite statements . The one great lesson that the Poor in general would have liked to have taught her , that their kitchens and sickrooms were not unreservedly at her disposal as private lecture halls , she had never been able to assimilate . She was ready to give them unlimited advice as to how they should keep the wolf from their doors , but in return she claimed and enforced for herself the penetrating powers of an east wind or a dust storm . Her visits among her wealthier acquaintances were equally extensive and enterprising , and hardly more welcome ; in country-house parties , while partaking to the fullest extent of the hospitality offered her , she made a practice of unburdening herself of homilies on the evils of leisure and luxury , which did not particularly endear her to her fellow guests . Hostesses regarded her philosophically as a form of social measles which everyone had to have once . The third prospective player , Francesca noted without any special enthusiasm , was Lady Caroline Benaresq . Lady Caroline was far from being a remarkably good bridge player , but she always managed to domineer mercilessly over any table that was favoured with her presence , and generally managed to win . A domineering player usually inflicts the chief damage and demoralisation on his partner ; Lady Caroline ’ s special achievement was to harass and demoralise partner and opponents alike . “ Weak and weak , ” she announced in her gentle voice , as she cut her hostess for a partner ; “ I suppose we had better play only five shillings a hundred. ” Francesca wondered at the old woman ’ s moderate assessment of the stake , knowing her fondness for highish play and her usual good luck in card holding . “ I don ’ t mind what we play , ” said Ada Spelvexit , with an incautious parade of elegant indifference ; as a matter of fact she was inwardly relieved and rejoicing at the reasonable figure proposed by Lady Caroline , and she would certainly have demurred if a higher stake had been suggested . She was not as a rule a successful player , and money lost at cards was always a poignant bereavement to her . “ Then as you don ’ t mind we ’ ll make it ten shillings a hundred , ” said Lady Caroline , with the pleased chuckle of one who has spread a net in the sight of a bird and disproved the vanity of the proceeding . It proved a tiresome ding-dong rubber , with the strength of the cards slightly on Francesca ’ s side , and the luck of the table going mostly the other way . She was too keen a player not to feel a certain absorption in the game once it had started , but she was conscious to-day of a distracting interest that competed with the momentary importance of leads and discards and declarations . The little accumulations of talk that were unpent during the dealing of the hands became as noteworthy to her alert attention as the play of the hands themselves . “ Yes , quite a small party this afternoon , ” said Serena , in reply to a seemingly casual remark on Francesca ’ s part ; “ and two or three non-players , which is unusual on a Wednesday . Canon Besomley was here just before you came ; you know , the big preaching man. ” “ I ’ ve been to hear him scold the human race once or twice , ” said Francesca . “ A strong man with a wonderfully strong message , ” said Ada Spelvexit , in an impressive and assertive tone . “ The sort of popular pulpiteer who spanks the vices of his age and lunches with them afterwards , ” said Lady Caroline . “ Hardly a fair summary of the man and his work , ” protested Ada . “ I ’ ve been to hear him many times when I ’ ve been depressed or discouraged , and I simply can ’ t tell you the impression his words leave— ” “ At least you can tell us what you intend to make trumps , ” broke in Lady Caroline , gently . “ Diamonds , ” pronounced Ada , after a rather flurried survey of her hand . “ Doubled , ” said Lady Caroline , with increased gentleness , and a few minutes later she was pencilling an addition of twenty-four to her score . “ I stayed with his people down in Herefordshire last May , ” said Ada , returning to the unfinished theme of the Canon ; “ such an exquisite rural retreat , and so restful and healing to the nerves . Real country scenery ; apple blossom everywhere. ” “ Surely only on the apple trees , ” said Lady Caroline . Ada Spelvexit gave up the attempt to reproduce the decorative setting of the Canon ’ s homelife , and fell back on the small but practical consolation of scoring the odd trick in her opponent ’ s declaration of hearts . “ If you had led your highest club to start with , instead of the nine , we should have saved the trick , ” remarked Lady Caroline to her partner in a tone of coldly , gentle reproof ; “ it ’ s no use , my dear , ” she continued , as Serena flustered out a halting apology , “ no earthly use to attempt to play bridge at one table and try to see and hear what ’ s going on at two or three other tables. ” “ I can generally manage to attend to more than one thing at a time , ” said Serena , rashly ; “ I think I must have a sort of double brain. ” “ Much better to economise and have one really good one , ” observed Lady Caroline . “ _La belle dame sans merci_ scoring a verbal trick or two as usual , ” said a player at another table in a discreet undertone . “ Did I tell you Sir Edward Roan is coming to my next big evening , ” said Serena , hurriedly , by way , perhaps , of restoring herself a little in her own esteem . “ Poor dear , good Sir Edward . What have you made trumps ? ” asked Lady Caroline , in one breath . “ Clubs , ” said Francesca ; “ and pray , why these adjectives of commiseration ? ” Francesca was a Ministerialist by family interest and allegiance , and was inclined to take up the cudgels at the suggested disparagement aimed at the Foreign Secretary . “ He amuses me so much , ” purred Lady Caroline . Her amusement was usually of the sort that a sporting cat derives from watching the Swedish exercises of a well-spent and carefully thought-out mouse . “ Really ? He has been rather a brilliant success at the Foreign Office , you know , ” said Francesca . “ He reminds one so of a circus elephant—infinitely more intelligent than the people who direct him , but quite content to go on putting his foot down or taking it up as may be required , quite unconcerned whether he steps on a meringue or a hornet ’ s nest in the process of going where he ’ s expected to go. ” “ How can you say such things ? ” protested Francesca . “ I can ’ t , ” said Lady Caroline ; “ Courtenay Youghal said it in the House last night . Didn ’ t you read the debate ? He was really rather in form . I disagree entirely with his point of view , of course , but some of the things he says have just enough truth behind them to redeem them from being merely smart ; for instance , his summing up of the Government ’ s attitude towards our embarrassing Colonial Empire in the wistful phrase ‘ happy is the country that has no geography. ’ ” “ What an absurdly unjust thing to say , ” put in Francesca ; “ I daresay some of our Party at some time have taken up that attitude , but every one knows that Sir Edward is a sound Imperialist at heart. ” “ Most politicians are something or other at heart , but no one would be rash enough to insure a politician against heart failure . Particularly when he happens to be in office. ” “ Anyhow , I don ’ t see that the Opposition leaders would have acted any differently in the present case , ” said Francesca . “ One should always speak guardedly of the Opposition leaders , ” said Lady Caroline , in her gentlest voice ; “ one never knows what a turn in the situation may do for them. ” “ You mean they may one day be at the head of affairs ? ” asked Serena , briskly . “ I mean they may one day lead the Opposition . One never knows. ” Lady Caroline had just remembered that her hostess was on the Opposition side in politics . Francesca and her partner scored four tricks in clubs ; the game stood irresolutely at twenty-four all . “ If you had followed the excellent lyrical advice given to the Maid of Athens and returned my heart we should have made two more tricks and gone game , ” said Lady Caroline to her partner . “ Mr . Youghal seems pushing himself to the fore of late , ” remarked Francesca , as Serena took up the cards to deal . Since the young politician ’ s name had been introduced into their conversation the opportunity for turning the talk more directly on him and his affairs was too good to be missed . “ I think he ’ s got a career before him , ” said Serena ; “ the House always fills when he ’ s speaking , and that ’ s a good sign . And then he ’ s young and got rather an attractive personality , which is always something in the political world. ” “ His lack of money will handicap him , unless he can find himself a rich wife or persuade someone to die and leave him a fat legacy , ” said Francesca ; “ since M.P. ’ s have become the recipients of a salary rather more is expected and demanded of them in the expenditure line than before. ” “ Yes , the House of Commons still remains rather at the opposite pole to the Kingdom of Heaven as regards entrance qualifications , ” observed Lady Caroline . “ There ought to be no difficulty about Youghal picking up a girl with money , ” said Serena ; “ with his prospects he would make an excellent husband for any woman with social ambitions. ” And she half sighed , as though she almost regretted that a previous matrimonial arrangement precluded her from entering into the competition on her own account . Francesca , under an assumption of languid interest , was watching Lady Caroline narrowly for some hint of suppressed knowledge of Youghal ’ s courtship of Miss de Frey . “ Whom are you marrying and giving in marriage ? ” The question came from George St. Michael , who had strayed over from a neighbouring table , attracted by the fragments of small-talk that had reached his ears . St. Michael was one of those dapper bird-like illusorily-active men , who seem to have been in a certain stage of middle-age for as long as human memory can recall them . A close-cut peaked beard lent a certain dignity to his appearance—a loan which the rest of his features and mannerisms were continually and successfully repudiating . His profession , if he had one , was submerged in his hobby , which consisted of being an advance-agent for small happenings or possible happenings that were or seemed imminent in the social world around him ; he found a perpetual and unflagging satisfaction in acquiring and retailing any stray items of gossip or information , particularly of a matrimonial nature , that chanced to come his way . Given the bare outline of an officially announced engagement he would immediately fill it in with all manner of details , true or , at any rate , probable , drawn from his own imagination or from some equally exclusive source . The _Morning Post_ might content itself with the mere statement of the arrangement which would shortly take place , but it was St. Michael ’ s breathless little voice that proclaimed how the contracting parties had originally met over a salmon-fishing incident , why the Guards ’ Chapel would not be used , why her Aunt Mary had at first opposed the match , how the question of the children ’ s religious upbringing had been compromised , etc. , etc. , to all whom it might interest and to many whom it might not . Beyond his industriously-earned pre-eminence in this special branch of intelligence , he was chiefly noteworthy for having a wife reputed to be the tallest and thinnest woman in the Home Counties . The two were sometimes seen together in Society , where they passed under the collective name of St. Michael and All Angles . “ We are trying to find a rich wife for Courtenay Youghal , ” said Serena , in answer to St. Michael ’ s question . “ Ah , there I ’ m afraid you ’ re a little late , ” he observed , glowing with the importance of pending revelation ; “ I ’ m afraid you ’ re a little late , ” he repeated , watching the effect of his words as a gardener might watch the development of a bed of carefully tended asparagus . “ I think the young gentleman has been before you and already found himself a rich mate in prospect. ” He lowered his voice as he spoke , not with a view to imparting impressive mystery to his statement , but because there were other table groups within hearing to whom he hoped presently to have the privilege of re-disclosing his revelation . “ Do you mean— ? ” began Serena . “ Miss de Frey , ” broke in St. Michael , hurriedly , fearful lest his revelation should be forestalled , even in guesswork ; “ quite an ideal choice , the very wife for a man who means to make his mark in politics . Twenty-four thousand a year , with prospects of more to come , and a charming place of her own not too far from town . Quite the type of girl , too , who will make a good political hostess , brains without being brainy , you know . Just the right thing . Of course , it would be premature to make any definite announcement at present— ” “ It would hardly be premature for my partner to announce what she means to make trumps , ” interrupted Lady Caroline , in a voice of such sinister gentleness that St. Michael fled headlong back to his own table . “ Oh , is it me ? I beg your pardon . I leave it , ” said Serena . “ Thank you . No trumps , ” declared Lady Caroline . The hand was successful , and the rubber ultimately fell to her with a comfortable margin of honours . The same partners cut together again , and this time the cards went distinctly against Francesca and Ada Spelvexit , and a heavily piled-up score confronted them at the close of the rubber . Francesca was conscious that a certain amount of rather erratic play on her part had at least contributed to the result . St. Michael ’ s incursion into the conversation had proved rather a powerful distraction to her ordinarily sound bridge-craft . Ada Spelvexit emptied her purse of several gold pieces and infused a corresponding degree of superiority into her manner . “ I must be going now , ” she announced ; “ I ’ m dining early . I have to give an address to some charwomen afterwards. ” “ Why ? ” asked Lady Caroline , with a disconcerting directness that was one of her most formidable characteristics . “ Oh , well , I have some things to say to them that I daresay they will like to hear , ” said Ada , with a thin laugh . Her statement was received with a silence that betokened profound unbelief in any such probability . “ I go about a good deal among working-class women , ” she added . “ No one has ever said it , ” observed Lady Caroline , “ but how painfully true it is that the poor have us always with them. ” Ada Spelvexit hastened her departure ; the marred impressiveness of her retreat came as a culminating discomfiture on the top of her ill-fortune at the card-table . Possibly , however , the multiplication of her own annoyances enabled her to survey charwomen ’ s troubles with increased cheerfulness . None of them , at any rate , had spent an afternoon with Lady Caroline . Francesca cut in at another table and with better fortune attending on her , succeeded in winning back most of her losses . A sense of satisfaction was distinctly dominant as she took leave of her hostess . St. Michael ’ s gossip , or rather the manner in which it had been received , had given her a clue to the real state of affairs , which , however slender and conjectural , at least pointed in the desired direction . At first she had been horribly afraid lest she should be listening to a definite announcement which would have been the death-blow to her hopes , but as the recitation went on without any of those assured little minor details which St. Michael so loved to supply , she had come to the conclusion that it was merely a piece of intelligent guesswork . And if Lady Caroline had really believed in the story of Elaine de Frey ’ s virtual engagement to Courtenay Youghal she would have taken a malicious pleasure in encouraging St. Michael in his confidences , and in watching Francesca ’ s discomfiture under the recital . The irritated manner in which she had cut short the discussion betrayed the fact , that , as far as the old woman ’ s information went , it was Comus and not Courtenay Youghal who held the field . And in this particular case Lady Caroline ’ s information was likely to be nearer the truth than St. Michael ’ s confident gossip . Francesca always gave a penny to the first crossing-sweeper or match-seller she chanced across after a successful sitting at bridge . This afternoon she had come out of the fray some fifteen shillings to the bad , but she gave two pennies to a crossing-sweeper at the north-west corner of Berkeley Square as a sort of thank-offering to the Gods . CHAPTER VIII IT was a fresh rain-repentant afternoon , following a morning that had been sultry and torrentially wet by turns ; the sort of afternoon that impels people to talk graciously of the rain as having done a lot of good , its chief merit in their eyes probably having been its recognition of the art of moderation . Also it was an afternoon that invited bodily activity after the convalescent languor of the earlier part of the day . Elaine had instinctively found her way into her riding-habit and sent an order down to the stables—a blessed oasis that still smelt sweetly of horse and hay and cleanliness in a world that reeked of petrol , and now she set her mare at a smart pace through a succession of long-stretching country lanes . She was due some time that afternoon at a garden-party , but she rode with determination in an opposite direction . In the first place neither Comus or Courtenay would be at the party , which fact seemed to remove any valid reason that could be thought of for inviting her attendance thereat ; in the second place about a hundred human beings would be gathered there , and human gatherings were not her most crying need at the present moment . Since her last encounter with her wooers , under the cedars in her own garden , Elaine realised that she was either very happy or cruelly unhappy , she could not quite determine which . She seemed to have what she most wanted in the world lying at her feet , and she was dreadfully uncertain in her more reflective moments whether she really wanted to stretch out her hand and take it . It was all very like some situation in an Arabian Nights tale or a story of Pagan Hellas , and consequently the more puzzling and disconcerting to a girl brought up on the methodical lines of Victorian Christianity . Her appeal court was in permanent session these last few days , but it gave no decisions , at least none that she would listen to . And the ride on her fast light-stepping little mare , alone and unattended , through the fresh-smelling leafy lanes into unexplored country , seemed just what she wanted at the moment . The mare made some small delicate pretence of being roadshy , not the staring dolt-like kind of nervousness that shows itself in an irritating hanging-back as each conspicuous wayside object presents itself , but the nerve-flutter of an imaginative animal that merely results in a quick whisk of the head and a swifter bound forward . She might have paraphrased the mental attitude of the immortalised Peter Bell into A basket underneath a tree A yellow tiger is to me , If it is nothing more . The more really alarming episodes of the road , the hoot and whir of a passing motor-car or the loud vibrating hum of a wayside threshing-machine , were treated with indifference . On turning a corner out of a narrow coppice-bordered lane into a wider road that sloped steadily upward in a long stretch of hill Elaine saw , coming toward her at no great distance , a string of yellow-painted vans , drawn for the most part by skewbald or speckled horses . A certain rakish air about these oncoming road-craft proclaimed them as belonging to a travelling wild-beast show , decked out in the rich primitive colouring that one ’ s taste in childhood would have insisted on before it had been schooled in the artistic value of dulness . It was an unlooked-for and distinctly unwelcome encounter . The mare had already commenced a sixfold scrutiny with nostrils , eyes and daintily-pricked ears ; one ear made hurried little backward movements to hear what Elaine was saying about the eminent niceness and respectability of the approaching caravan , but even Elaine felt that she would be unable satisfactorily to explain the elephants and camels that would certainly form part of the procession . To turn back would seem rather craven , and the mare might take fright at the manœuvre and try to bolt ; a gate standing ajar at the entrance to a farmyard lane provided a convenient way out of the difficulty . As Elaine pushed her way through she became aware of a man standing just inside the lane , who made a movement forward to open the gate for her . “ Thank you . I ’ m just getting out of the way of a wild-beast show , ” she explained ; “ my mare is tolerant of motors and traction-engines , but I expect camels—hullo , ” she broke off , recognising the man as an old acquaintance , “ I heard you had taken rooms in a farmhouse somewhere . Fancy meeting you in this way. ” In the not very distant days of her little-girlhood , Tom Keriway had been a man to be looked upon with a certain awe and envy ; indeed the glamour of his roving career would have fired the imagination , and wistful desire to do likewise , of many young Englishmen . It seemed to be the grown-up realisation of the games played in dark rooms in winter fire-lit evenings , and the dreams dreamed over favourite books of adventure . Making Vienna his headquarters , almost his home , he had rambled where he listed through the lands of the Near and Middle East as leisurely and thoroughly as tamer souls might explore Paris . He had wandered through Hungarian horse-fairs , hunted shy crafty beasts on lonely Balkan hillsides , dropped himself pebble-wise into the stagnant human pool of some Bulgarian monastery , threaded his way through the strange racial mosaic of Salonika , listened with amused politeness to the shallow ultra-modern opinions of a voluble editor or lawyer in some wayside Russian town , or learned wisdom from a chance tavern companion , one of the atoms of the busy ant-stream of men and merchandise that moves untiringly round the shores of the Black Sea . And far and wide as he might roam he always managed to turn up at frequent intervals , at ball and supper and theatre , in the gay Hauptstadt of the Habsburgs , haunting his favourite cafés and wine-vaults , skimming through his favourite news-sheets , greeting old acquaintances and friends , from ambassadors down to cobblers in the social scale . He seldom talked of his travels , but it might be said that his travels talked of him ; there was an air about him that a German diplomat once summed up in a phrase : “ a man that wolves have sniffed at. ” And then two things happened , which he had not mapped out in his route ; a severe illness shook half the life and all the energy out of him , and a heavy money loss brought him almost to the door of destitution . With something , perhaps , of the impulse which drives a stricken animal away from its kind , Tom Keriway left the haunts where he had known so much happiness , and withdrew into the shelter of a secluded farmhouse lodging ; more than ever he became to Elaine a hearsay personality . And now the chance meeting with the caravan had flung her across the threshold of his retreat . “ What a charming little nook you ’ ve got hold of , ” she exclaimed with instinctive politeness , and then looked searchingly round , and discovered that she had spoken the truth ; it really was charming . The farmhouse had that intensely English look that one seldom sees out of Normandy . Over the whole scene of rickyard , garden , outbuildings , horsepond and orchard , brooded that air which seems rightfully to belong to out-of-the-way farmyards , an air of wakeful dreaminess which suggests that here , man and beast and bird have got up so early that the rest of the world has never caught them up and never will . Elaine dismounted , and Keriway led the mare round to a little paddock by the side of a great grey barn . At the end of the lane they could see the show go past , a string of lumbering vans and great striding beasts that seemed to link the vast silences of the desert with the noises and sights and smells , the naphtha-flares and advertisement hoardings and trampled orange-peel , of an endless succession of towns . “ You had better let the caravan pass well on its way before you get on the road again , ” said Keriway ; “ the smell of the beasts may make your mare nervous and restive going home. ” Then he called to a boy who was busy with a hoe among some defiantly prosperous weeds , to fetch the lady a glass of milk and a piece of currant loaf . “ I don ’ t know when I ’ ve seen anything so utterly charming and peaceful , ” said Elaine , propping herself on a seat that a pear-tree had obligingly designed in the fantastic curve of its trunk . “ Charming , certainly , ” said Keriway , “ but too full of the stress of its own little life struggle to be peaceful . Since I have lived here I ’ ve learnt , what I ’ ve always suspected , that a country farmhouse , set away in a world of its own , is one of the most wonderful studies of interwoven happenings and tragedies that can be imagined . It is like the old chronicles of medieval Europe in the days when there was a sort of ordered anarchy between feudal lords and overlords , and burg-grafs , and mitred abbots , and prince-bishops , robber barons and merchant guilds , and Electors and so forth , all striving and contending and counter-plotting , and interfering with each other under some vague code of loosely-applied rules . Here one sees it reproduced under one ’ s eyes , like a musty page of black-letter come to life . Look at one little section of it , the poultry-life on the farm . Villa poultry , dull egg-machines , with records kept of how many ounces of food they eat , and how many pennyworths of eggs they lay , give you no idea of the wonder-life of these farm-birds ; their feuds and jealousies , and carefully maintained prerogatives , their unsparing tyrannies and persecutions , their calculated courage and bravado or sedulously hidden cowardice , it might all be some human chapter from the annals of the old Rhineland or medieval Italy . And then , outside their own bickering wars and hates , the grim enemies that come up against them from the woodlands ; the hawk that dashes among the coops like a moss-trooper raiding the border , knowing well that a charge of shot may tear him to bits at any moment . And the stoat , a creeping slip of brown fur a few inches long , intently and unstayably out for blood . And the hunger-taught master of craft , the red fox , who has waited perhaps half the afternoon for his chance while the fowls were dusting themselves under the hedge , and just as they were turning supper-ward to the yard one has stopped a moment to give her feathers a final shake and found death springing upon her . Do you know , ” he continued , as Elaine fed herself and the mare with morsels of currant-loaf , “ I don ’ t think any tragedy in literature that I have ever come across impressed me so much as the first one , that I spelled out slowly for myself in words of three letters : the bad fox has got the red hen . There was something so dramatically complete about it ; the badness of the fox , added to all the traditional guile of his race , seemed to heighten the horror of the hen ’ s fate , and there was such a suggestion of masterful malice about the word ‘ got. ’ One felt that a countryside in arms would not get that hen away from the bad fox . They used to think me a slow dull reader for not getting on with my lesson , but I used to sit and picture to myself the red hen , with its wings beating helplessly , screeching in terrified protest , or perhaps , if he had got it by the neck , with beak wide agape and silent , and eyes staring , as it left the farmyard for ever . I have seen blood-spillings and down-crushings and abject defeat here and there in my time , but the red hen has remained in my mind as the type of helpless tragedy. ” He was silent for a moment as if he were again musing over the three-letter drama that had so dwelt in his childhood ’ s imagination . “ Tell me some of the things you have seen in your time , ” was the request that was nearly on Elaine ’ s lips , but she hastily checked herself and substituted another . “ Tell me more about the farm , please. ” And he told her of a whole world , or rather of several intermingled worlds , set apart in this sleepy hollow in the hills , of beast lore and wood lore and farm craft , at times touching almost the border of witchcraft—passing lightly here , not with the probing eagerness of those who know nothing , but with the averted glance of those who fear to see too much . He told her of those things that slept and those that prowled when the dusk fell , of strange hunting cats , of the yard swine and the stalled cattle , of the farm folk themselves , as curious and remote in their way , in their ideas and fears and wants and tragedies , as the brutes and feathered stock that they tended . It seemed to Elaine as if a musty store of old-world children ’ s books had been fetched down from some cobwebbed lumber-room and brought to life . Sitting there in the little paddock , grown thickly with tall weeds and rank grasses , and shadowed by the weather-beaten old grey barn , listening to this chronicle of wonderful things , half fanciful , half very real , she could scarcely believe that a few miles away there was a garden-party in full swing , with smart frocks and smart conversation , fashionable refreshments and fashionable music , and a fevered undercurrent of social strivings and snubbings . Did Vienna and the Balkan Mountains and the Black Sea seem as remote and hard to believe in , she wondered , to the man sitting by her side , who had discovered or invented this wonderful fairyland ? Was it a true and merciful arrangement of fate and life that the things of the moment thrust out the after-taste of the things that had been ? Here was one who had held much that was priceless in the hollow of his hand and lost it all , and he was happy and absorbed and well-content with the little wayside corner of the world into which he had crept . And Elaine , who held so many desirable things in the hollow of her hand , could not make up her mind to be even moderately happy . She did not even know whether to take this hero of her childhood down from his pedestal , or to place him on a higher one ; on the whole she was inclined to resent rather than approve the idea that ill-health and misfortune could so completely subdue and tame an erstwhile bold and roving spirit . The mare was showing signs of delicately-hinted impatience ; the paddock , with its teasing insects and very indifferent grazing , had not thrust out the image of her own comfortable well-foddered loose-box . Elaine divested her habit of some remaining crumbs of bun-loaf and jumped lightly on to her saddle . As she rode slowly down the lane , with Keriway escorting her as far as its gate , she looked round at what had seemed to her , a short while ago , just a picturesque old farmstead , a place of bee-hives and hollyhocks and gabled cart-sheds ; now it was in her eyes a magic city , with an undercurrent of reality beneath its magic . “ You are a person to be envied , ” she said to Keriway ; “ you have created a fairyland , and you are living in it yourself. ” “ Envied ? ” He shot the question out with sudden bitterness . She looked down and saw the wistful misery that had come into his face . “ Once , ” he said to her , “ in a German paper I read a short story about a tame crippled crane that lived in the park of some small town . I forget what happened in the story , but there was one line that I shall always remember : ‘ it was lame , that is why it was tame. ’ ” He had created a fairyland , but assuredly he was not living in it . CHAPTER IX IN the warmth of a late June morning the long shaded stretch of raked earth , gravel-walk and rhododendron bush that is known affectionately as the Row was alive with the monotonous movement and alert stagnation appropriate to the time and place . The seekers after health , the seekers after notoriety and recognition , and the lovers of good exercise were all well represented on the galloping ground ; the gravel-walk and chairs and long seats held a population whose varied instincts and motives would have baffled a social catalogue-maker . The children , handled or in perambulators , might be excused from instinct or motive ; they were brought . Pleasingly conspicuous among a bunch of indifferent riders pacing along by the rails where the onlookers were thickest was Courtenay Youghal , on his handsome plum-roan gelding Anne de Joyeuse . That delicately stepping animal had taken a prize at Islington and nearly taken the life of a stable-boy of whom he disapproved , but his strongest claims to distinction were his good looks and his high opinion of himself . Youghal evidently believed in thorough accord between horse and rider . “ Please stop and talk to me , ” said a quiet beckoning voice from the other side of the rails , and Youghal drew rein and greeted Lady Veula Croot . Lady Veula had married into a family of commercial solidity and enterprising political nonentity . She had a devoted husband , some blonde teachable children , and a look of unutterable weariness in her eyes . To see her standing at the top of an expensively horticultured staircase receiving her husband ’ s guests was rather like watching an animal performing on a music-hall stage . One always tells oneself that the animal likes it , and one always knows that it doesn ’ t . “ Lady Veula is an ardent Free Trader , isn ’ t she ? ” someone once remarked to Lady Caroline . “ I wonder , ” said Lady Caroline , in her gently questioning voice ; “ a woman whose dresses are made in Paris and whose marriage has been made in Heaven might be equally biassed for and against free imports. ” Lady Veula looked at Youghal and his mount with slow critical appraisement , and there was a note of blended raillery and wistfulness in her voice . “ You two dear things , I should love to stroke you both , but I ’ m not sure how Joyeuse would take it . So I ’ ll stroke you down verbally instead . I admired your attack on Sir Edward immensely , though of course I don ’ t agree with a word of it . Your description of him building a hedge round the German cuckoo and hoping he was isolating it was rather sweet . Seriously though , I regard him as one of the pillars of the Administration. ” “ So do I , ” said Youghal ; “ the misfortune is that he is merely propping up a canvas roof . It ’ s just his regrettable solidity and integrity that makes him so expensively dangerous . The average Briton arrives at the same judgment about Roan ’ s handling of foreign affairs as Omar does of the Supreme Being in his dealings with the world : He ’ s a good fellow and ’ twill all be well. ’ ” Lady Veula laughed lightly . “ My Party is in power so I may exercise the privilege of being optimistic . Who is that who bowed to you ? ” she continued , as a dark young man with an inclination to stoutness passed by them on foot ; “ I ’ ve seen him about a good deal lately . He ’ s been to one or two of my dances. ” “ Andrei Drakoloff , ” said Youghal ; “ he ’ s just produced a play that has had a big success in Moscow and is certain to be extremely popular all over Russia . In the first three acts the heroine is supposed to be dying of consumption ; in the last act they find she is really dying of cancer. ” “ Are the Russians really such a gloomy people ? ” “ Gloom-loving but not in the least gloomy . They merely take their sadness pleasurably , just as we are accused of taking our pleasures sadly . Have you noticed that dreadful Klopstock youth has been pounding past us at shortening intervals . He ’ ll come up and talk if he half catches your eye. ” “ I only just know him . Isn ’ t he at an agricultural college or something of the sort ? ” “ Yes , studying to be a gentleman farmer , he told me . I didn ’ t ask if both subjects were compulsory. ” “ You ’ re really rather dreadful , ” said Lady Veula , trying to look as if she thought so ; “ remember , we are all equal in the sight of Heaven. ” For a preacher of wholesome truths her voice rather lacked conviction . “ If I and Ernest Klopstock are really equal in the sight of Heaven , ” said Youghal , with intense complacency , “ I should recommend Heaven to consult an eye specialist. ” There was a heavy spattering of loose earth , and a squelching of saddle-leather , as the Klopstock youth lumbered up to the rails and delivered himself of loud , cheerful greetings . Joyeuse laid his ears well back as the ungainly bay cob and his appropriately matched rider drew up beside him ; his verdict was reflected and endorsed by the cold stare of Youghal ’ s eyes . “ I ’ ve been having a nailing fine time , ” recounted the newcomer with clamorous enthusiasm ; “ I was over in Paris last month and had lots of strawberries there , then I had a lot more in London , and now I ’ ve been having a late crop of them in Herefordshire , so I ’ ve had quite a lot this year. ” And he laughed as one who had deserved well and received well of Fate . “ The charm of that story , ” said Youghal , “ is that it can be told in any drawing-room. ” And with a sweep of his wide-brimmed hat to Lady Veula he turned the impatient Joyeuse into the moving stream of horse and horsemen . “ That woman reminds me of some verse I ’ ve read and liked , ” thought Youghal , as Joyeuse sprang into a light showy canter that gave full recognition to the existence of observant human beings along the side walk . “ Ah , I have it. ” And he quoted almost aloud , as one does in the exhilaration of a canter : “ How much I loved that way you had Of smiling most , when very sad , A smile which carried tender hints Of sun and spring , And yet , more than all other thing , Of weariness beyond all words. ” And having satisfactorily fitted Lady Veula on to a quotation he dismissed her from his mind . With the constancy of her sex she thought about him , his good looks and his youth and his railing tongue , till late in the afternoon . While Youghal was putting Joyeuse through his paces under the elm trees of the Row a little drama in which he was directly interested was being played out not many hundred yards away . Elaine and Comus were indulging themselves in two pennyworths of Park chair , drawn aside just a little from the serried rows of sitters who were set out like bedded plants over an acre or so of turf . Comus was , for the moment , in a mood of pugnacious gaiety , disbursing a fund of pointed criticism and unsparing anecdote concerning those of the promenaders or loungers whom he knew personally or by sight . Elaine was rather quieter than usual , and the grave serenity of the Leonardo da Vinci portrait seemed intensified in her face this morning . In his leisurely courtship Comus had relied almost exclusively on his physical attraction and the fitful drollery of his wit and high spirits , and these graces had gone far to make him seem a very desirable and rather lovable thing in Elaine ’ s eyes . But he had left out of account the disfavour which he constantly risked and sometimes incurred from his frank and undisguised indifference to other people ’ s interests and wishes , including , at times , Elaine ’ s . And the more that she felt that she liked him the more she was irritated by his lack of consideration for her . Without expecting that her every wish should become a law to him she would at least have liked it to reach the formality of a Second Reading . Another important factor he had also left out of his reckoning , namely the presence on the scene of another suitor , who also had youth and wit to recommend him , and who certainly did not lack physical attractions . Comus , marching carelessly through unknown country to effect what seemed already an assured victory , made the mistake of disregarding the existence of an unbeaten army on his flank . To-day Elaine felt that , without having actually quarrelled , she and Comus had drifted a little bit out of sympathy with one another . The fault she knew was scarcely hers , in fact from the most good-natured point of view it could hardly be denied that it was almost entirely his . The incident of the silver dish had lacked even the attraction of novelty ; it had been one of a series , all bearing a strong connecting likeness . There had been small unrepaid loans which Elaine would not have grudged in themselves , though the application for them brought a certain qualm of distaste ; with the perversity which seemed inseparable from his doings , Comus had always flung away a portion of his borrowings in some ostentatious piece of glaring and utterly profitless extravagance , which outraged all the canons of her upbringing without bringing him an atom of understandable satisfaction . Under these repeated discouragements it was not surprising that some small part of her affection should have slipped away , but she had come to the Park that morning with an unconfessed expectation of being gently wooed back to the mood of gracious forgetfulness that she was only too eager to assume . It was almost worth while being angry with Comus for the sake of experiencing the pleasure of being coaxed into friendliness again with the charm which he knew so well how to exert . It was delicious here under the trees on this perfect June morning , and Elaine had the blessed assurance that most of the women within range were envying her the companionship of the handsome merry-hearted youth who sat by her side . With special complacence she contemplated her cousin Suzette , who was self-consciously but not very elatedly basking in the attentions of her fiancé , an earnest-looking young man who was superintendent of a People ’ s something-or-other on the south side of the river , and whose clothes Comus had described as having been made in Southwark rather than in anger . Most of the pleasures in life must be paid for , and the chair-ticket vendor in due time made his appearance in quest of pennies . Comus paid him from out of a varied assortment of coins and then balanced the remainder in the palm of his hand . Elaine felt a sudden foreknowledge of something disagreeable about to happen and a red spot deepened in her cheeks . “ Four shillings and fivepence and a half-penny , ” said Comus , reflectively . “ It ’ s a ridiculous sum to last me for the next three days , and I owe a card debt of over two pounds. ” “ Yes ? ” commented Elaine dryly and with an apparent lack of interest in his exchequer statement . Surely , she was thinking hurriedly to herself , he could not be foolish enough to broach the matter of another loan . “ The card debt is rather a nuisance , ” pursued Comus , with fatalistic persistency . “ You won seven pounds last week , didn ’ t you ? ” asked Elaine ; “ don ’ t you put by any of your winnings to balance losses ? ” “ The four shillings and the fivepence and the half-penny represent the rearguard of the seven pounds , ” said Comus ; “ the rest have fallen by the way . If I can pay the two pounds to-day I daresay I shall win something more to go on with ; I ’ m holding rather good cards just now . But if I can ’ t pay it of course I shan ’ t show up at the club . So you see the fix I am in. ” Elaine took no notice of this indirect application . The Appeal Court was assembling in haste to consider new evidence , and this time there was the rapidity of sudden determination about its movement . The conversation strayed away from the fateful topic for a few moments and then Comus brought it deliberately back to the danger zone . “ It would be awfully nice if you would let me have a fiver for a few days , Elaine , ” he said quickly ; “ if you don ’ t I really don ’ t know what I shall do. ” “ If you are really bothered about your card debt I will send you the two pounds by messenger boy early this afternoon. ” She spoke quietly and with great decision . “ And I shall not be at the Connor ’ s dance to-night , ” she continued ; “ it ’ s too hot for dancing . I ’ m going home now ; please don ’ t bother to accompany me , I particularly wish to go alone. ” Comus saw that he had overstepped the mark of her good nature . Wisely he made no immediate attempt to force himself back into her good graces . He would wait till her indignation had cooled . His tactics would have been excellent if he had not forgotten that unbeaten army on his flank . Elaine de Frey had known very clearly what qualities she had wanted in Comus , and she had known , against all efforts at self-deception , that he fell far short of those qualities . She had been willing to lower her standard of moral requirements in proportion as she was fond of the boy , but there was a point beyond which she would not go . He had hurt her pride besides alarming her sense of caution . Suzette , on whom she felt a thoroughly justified tendency to look down , had at any rate an attentive and considerate lover . Elaine walked towards the Park gates feeling that in one essential Suzette possessed something that had been denied to her , and at the gates she met Joyeuse and his spruce young rider preparing to turn homeward . “ Get rid of Joyeuse and come and take me out to lunch somewhere , ” demanded Elaine . “ How jolly , ” said Youghal . “ Let ’ s go to the Corridor Restaurant . The head waiter there is an old Viennese friend of mine and looks after me beautifully . I ’ ve never been there with a lady before , and he ’ s sure to ask me afterwards , in his fatherly way , if we ’ re engaged. ” The lunch was a success in every way . There was just enough orchestral effort to immerse the conversation without drowning it , and Youghal was an attentive and inspired host . Through an open doorway Elaine could see the café reading-room , with its imposing array of _Neue Freie Presse_ , _Berliner Tageblatt_ , and other exotic newspapers hanging on the wall . She looked across at the young man seated opposite her , who gave one the impression of having centred the most serious efforts of his brain on his toilet and his food , and recalled some of the flattering remarks that the press had bestowed on his recent speeches . “ Doesn ’ t it make you conceited , Courtenay , ” she asked , “ to look at all those foreign newspapers hanging there and know that most of them have got paragraphs and articles about your Persian speech ? ” Youghal laughed . “ There ’ s always a chastening corrective in the thought that some of them may have printed your portrait . When once you ’ ve seen your features hurriedly reproduced in the _Matin_ , for instance , you feel you would like to be a veiled Turkish woman for the rest of your life. ” And Youghal gazed long and lovingly at his reflection in the nearest mirror , as an antidote against possible incitements to humility in the portrait gallery of fame . Elaine felt a certain soothed satisfaction in the fact that this young man , whose knowledge of the Middle East was an embarrassment to Ministers at question time and in debate , was showing himself equally well-informed on the subject of her culinary likes and dislikes . If Suzette could have been forced to attend as a witness at a neighbouring table she would have felt even happier . “ Did the head waiter ask if we were engaged ? ” asked Elaine , when Courtenay had settled the bill , and she had finished collecting her sunshade and gloves and other impedimenta from the hands of obsequious attendants . “ Yes , ” said Youghal , “ and he seemed quite crestfallen when I had to say ‘ no. ’ ” “ It would be horrid to disappoint him when he ’ s looked after us so charmingly , ” said Elaine ; “ tell him that we are. ” CHAPTER X THE Rutland Galleries were crowded , especially in the neighbourhood of the tea-buffet , by a fashionable throng of art-patrons which had gathered to inspect Mervyn Quentock ’ s collection of Society portraits . Quentock was a young artist whose abilities were just receiving due recognition from the critics ; that the recognition was not overdue he owed largely to his perception of the fact that if one hides one ’ s talent under a bushel one must be careful to point out to everyone the exact bushel under which it is hidden . There are two manners of receiving recognition : one is to be discovered so long after one ’ s death that one ’ s grandchildren have to write to the papers to establish their relationship ; the other is to be discovered , like the infant Moses , at the very outset of one ’ s career . Mervyn Quentock had chosen the latter and happier manner . In an age when many aspiring young men strive to advertise their wares by imparting to them a freakish imbecility , Quentock turned out work that was characterised by a pleasing delicate restraint , but he contrived to herald his output with a certain fanfare of personal eccentricity , thereby compelling an attention which might otherwise have strayed past his studio . In appearance he was the ordinary cleanly young Englishman , except , perhaps , that his eyes rather suggested a library edition of the Arabian Nights ; his clothes matched his appearance and showed no taint of the sartorial disorder by which the bourgeois of the garden-city and the Latin Quarter anxiously seeks to proclaim his kinship with art and thought . His eccentricity took the form of flying in the face of some of the prevailing social currents of the day , but as a reactionary , never as a reformer . He produced a gasp of admiring astonishment in fashionable circles by refusing to paint actresses—except , of course , those who had left the legitimate drama to appear between the boards of Debrett . He absolutely declined to execute portraits of Americans unless they hailed from certain favoured States . His “ water-colour-line , ” as a New York paper phrased it , earned for him a crop of angry criticisms and a shoal of Transatlantic commissions , and criticism and commissions were the things that Quentock most wanted . “ Of course he is perfectly right , ” said Lady Caroline Benaresq , calmly rescuing a piled-up plate of caviare sandwiches from the neighbourhood of a trio of young ladies who had established themselves hopefully within easy reach of it . “ Art , ” she continued , addressing herself to the Rev . Poltimore Vardon , “ has always been geographically exclusive . London may be more important from most points of view than Venice , but the art of portrait painting , which would never concern itself with a Lord Mayor , simply grovels at the feet of the Doges . As a Socialist I ’ m bound to recognise the right of Ealing to compare itself with Avignon , but one can not expect the Muses to put the two on a level. ” “ Exclusiveness , ” said the Reverend Poltimore , “ has been the salvation of Art , just as the lack of it is proving the downfall of religion . My colleagues of the cloth go about zealously proclaiming the fact that Christianity , in some form or other , is attracting shoals of converts among all sorts of races and tribes , that one had scarcely ever heard of , except in reviews of books of travel that one never read . That sort of thing was all very well when the world was more sparsely populated , but nowadays , when it simply teems with human beings , no one is particularly impressed by the fact that a few million , more or less , of converts , of a low stage of mental development , have accepted the teachings of some particular religion . It not only chills one ’ s enthusiasm , it positively shakes one ’ s convictions when one hears that the things one has been brought up to believe as true are being very favourably spoken of by Buriats and Samoyeds and Kanakas. ” The Rev . Poltimore Vardon had once seen a resemblance in himself to Voltaire , and had lived alongside the comparison ever since . “ No modern cult or fashion , ” he continued , “ would be favourably influenced by considerations based on statistics ; fancy adopting a certain style of hat or cut of coat , because it was being largely worn in Lancashire and the Midlands ; fancy favouring a certain brand of champagne because it was being extensively patronised in German summer resorts . No wonder that religion is falling into disuse in this country under such ill-directed methods. ” “ You can ’ t prevent the heathen being converted if they choose to be , ” said Lady Caroline ; “ this is an age of toleration. ” “ You could always deny it , ” said the Rev . Poltimore , “ like the Belgians do with regrettable occurrences in the Congo . But I would go further than that . I would stimulate the waning enthusiasm",The Unbearable Bassington
